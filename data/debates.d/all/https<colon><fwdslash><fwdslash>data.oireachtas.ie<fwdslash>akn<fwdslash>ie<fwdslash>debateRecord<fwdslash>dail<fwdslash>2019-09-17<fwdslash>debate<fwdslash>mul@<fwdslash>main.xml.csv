Fundamentally, looking back and looking at it from a distance, one could say the primary producer has been increasingly marginalised in the sector overall. The Government and beef industry itself have reacted far too late to what has been a growing and deepening crisis for many beef farmers. That belated response has contributed to the crisis itself but also to the difficulty in resolving it. The National Ploughing Championships commenced today. This is an event that showcases the very best of Irish agriculture and farming but it is against the backdrop of the severest crisis facing the beef sector in many years. It is fair to say that the crisis has been exacerbated by the Brexit situation. The signing and endorsement by the Government and former Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, of the Mercosur beef deal further enraged beef farmers at a particularly difficult time. Thousands of workers have been laid off, with very negative consequences for the economies in the towns in question and the hinterlands of the factories. Last March, Fianna Fáil constructively tabled a Private Members' motion calling for progressive action to be taken on fair prices, the 30-month age restriction, the four-movement rule, weight restrictions on cattle, 70 days' residency and transparency in the beef supply chain. We have been calling for a food ombudsman for quite a long time. It is interesting that many of the elements called for are now contained in the agreement signed this week but it has taken this long to have some significant movement on these issues. The Government did not act urgently enough on the motion. We had during the local elections an electorally engineered scheme involving the former Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, and the Government but we learned subsequently that there were many caveats and conditions attached to the BEAM initiative, resulting in many small farmers, in particular, not applying, because it involves a reduction in livestock. Negotiations this week have resulted in an agreement, signed by the representative bodies of the farming sector. This has not yet translated to the picket line and the blockades have not been lifted. This reflects a lack of trust, a level of frustration among farmers and a breakdown in relationships between all in the sector. We welcome the agreement. We believe space should be given to the various farm organisations to discuss, advocate and vote for the deal. Speedy implementation has to occur.I put it to the Taoiseach, however, that the Government should still seek further Common Agricultural Policy market disturbance aid for losses incurred since May. It should avail of all avenues to increase the live export trade; the Government has also been tardy on that front. It should also work towards the introduction of a €200 suckler cow payment in the next CAP. The Government should reject the Mercosur deal, which will undermine EU climate change policy. Will the Taoiseach agree to those measures? Does he accept that a comprehensive range of measures has to be taken to ensure a sustainable future for beef farming in this country?

We have much to do. On the Deputy's question, I acknowledge the extraordinarily difficult times beef farmers are facing. For more than a year, prices paid to beef farmers at the factory gate have been very low at approximately €3.50 per kilogram, which is less than the cost of production. Many farmers are at their wits' end because these prices have persisted for so long. There are many reasons that prices are low. Consumption and demand are flat, production is up, and sterling is weak. The price that Irish farmers get, however, is roughly the European average. It is set by the market, not by the Government or anyone in this House. It is largely a function of supply and demand. The Government is certainly trying to help and has done a lot to assist farmers in the last year or so. For example, it is opening new markets in China and across Asia. There has been a 60% increase in Bord Bia's budget to open new markets around the world to Irish beef. Some €40 million was provided in the last budget for areas of natural constraint payments and for the beef environmental programme. In recent weeks, €100 million was made available to support farm incomes. Approximately €80 million of that €100 million has been allocated. There is still €20 million available. These are very significant supports. They are much greater than the supports that would be offered to any other loss-making sector. They have been provided for a reason, however, which is that we care about family farms, the livelihoods of our beef farmers and the future of the beef industry and its wider value to the rural economy.  Producer organisations have now been recognised for the first time. This could potentially change things significantly. At the moment farmers are price takers. The establishment of producer organisations for the first time allows farmers to come together as a group to negotiate proper contracts and proper prices with the factories. That can and should help to increase the prices paid to farmers but it must be allowed time to operate and function. On the questions the Deputy raised, the Common Agricultural Policy will be reformed as part of the new EU budget. It is the position of the Irish Government that the CAP budget should be protected in full. We do not agree with, nor will we accept, the 5% cut proposed by the European Commission. If we are to convince European taxpayers and our European partners to defend and protect the CAP budget, however, the CAP will need to be reformed and modernised to take account of matters such as the environment and animal welfare, even more so than it does at the moment. The Mercosur agreement is not yet signed. That is not correct. That deal may be put to member states for ratification in approximately two years' time. As I have said before, we will not support a trade agreement that damages the environment or exposes our industry to unfair competition.

It seems that a lot of time was lost and a lot of resentment and frustration was allowed to build up within the beef farming sector before people got down to work and began to engage. That is a great pity because fundamentally it is a question of fair prices. I believe in food security. I also believe that a country like Ireland needs to retain key sectors such as the beef sector, have a diversity of food supply in our country and contribute to Europe. I fundamentally believe that. To ensure that happens, however, a greater weight has to be given to the primary producer. The role of the primary producer has been eroded for some time now.That issue is at the heart of this crisis and needs to be redressed. Some of the agreement's proposals have merit, but they could have been initiated well over one or two years ago, for example, those relating to the task force, the price index and so on. These are measures for which we have been advocating for quite some time-----

In two years' time when there is a legal agreement, we will be in a position to assess it and take a position on it then, but I have said before that we will always defend the interests of Irish industry and Irish farmers when it comes to any trade agreement. We have secured €100 million in income support for farmers - €50 million coming from the Exchequer and €50 million coming from the European Commission. As of now, only €80 million of that €100 million has been drawn down. Yes, we can certainly give consideration to a further request, but that has to come at the appropriate time, and that €100 million has yet to be fully drawn down. In respect of the protest and the blockades, the Minister, Deputy Creed, convened talks. Those talks were successful in coming to an agreement.

The Taoiseach's words will offer them little hope and comfort. In the midst of the figures that he rattled off, he did not mention, even though he should have, that many beef farmers made less than €10,000 per year. Despite doing most of the work, farmers only receive approximately 20% of the sale price of beef. As the Taoiseach set out, the current price for a kilo of beef is €3.45. That is below the break-even point. Brexit looms, and the reality is that beef farmers are struggling for their very survival. That is why there are pickets on the gate. Many see this campaign as their last stand before their livelihoods are gone forever. This crisis did not come out of the blue. It has been taking shape for decades. This dispute is the direct result of corporate greed and the inequalities that have long existed in the market. Farmers are price takers, not price makers. Prices are decided by a very small and powerful group of people, which is something that does not feel, look or smell right. Fairness and fair play do not exist in this market or in the experience of beef farmers. As a result, the industry is on the brink. While the livelihood of beef farmers is being ruined, thousands of factory workers have been laid off. Only this morning, we heard of 350 temporary lay-offs at a plant in Cahir, County Tipperary.Much like the struggling farmers, these workers have bills to pay and children to feed and the loss of their pay cheques is absolutely devastating. Farmers do not want to be on the picket line, they want to be farming. Factory workers want to be back at work, earning a living. However, that is not going to happen unless the principle of fair play is brought to bear. I acknowledge that the two rounds of talks so far have delivered some progress regarding bonus payments and a grid review. However, the core issue of the base price being offered to farmers remains. There is a solution in that regard. The way to bring this dispute to an end is for the highly profitable meat factories to agree a base price increase with farmers. It seems clear that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, must convene a new round of talks at which farming organisations and processors can discuss this increase in base price. It is also clear that supports must be offered to the workers who have been laid off. Does the Taoiseach agree that meat processors should sit down again with farmers and agree an increased base price? Will the Minister convene a new round of talks to facilitate such a negotiation and agreement?

The average price is roughly the same across Europe and it is lower elsewhere. Commodity prices often work that way because they are set by the market as a function of supply and demand. However, that price is too low. It is well below the cost of production for farmers and that is the underlying problem that has given rise to this dispute and these difficulties. The Minister has acted. He convened and chaired talks and secured an agreement that will bring about greater transparency, higher premiums, ensure that no legal action will be taken against protestors and that any existing legal action will be removed. The establishment and recognition of producer organisations is now permitted and that is crucial because it will allow farmers to band together and negotiate with meat factories for a proper contract and price. That is what needs to happen next. The agreement reached has been endorsed by the Minister, the meat industry and the six farming organisations that represent the vast majority of farmers. I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Micheál Martin, and Fianna Fáil have endorsed the agreement. I did not hear Sinn Féin endorse the agreement. I hope it will do so because if Sinn Féin wants the 3,500 workers who Deputy McDonald mentioned to get back to work, the factories need to reopen.

It matters not a whit whether Deputy Micheál Martin, the Taoiseach or anyone else in the House endorses this agreement if it is not sellable and does not work for the farmers who are out on the picket lines. That is what matters. I am disappointed that the Taoiseach would try to use this issue to provoke a party-political fracas. It is not appropriate. Some 6,000 workers have been temporarily laid off and they want to get back to work. The Taoiseach described all that has been achieved in the negotiations to date. I acknowledged that progress has been made in my initial remarks. However, the issue of the base price has not been addressed. There is no point in telling farmers that they can act collectively and, at some point in the future, achieve a price increase. They need it now. I was on a picket line in County Cavan with farmers who told me that this is either sorted now or they will not be in business next year. Pushing this issue down the pipe is not going to work. It is unedifying for the Taoiseach to issue a threat to farmers to the effect that they must go with this agreement or get nothing. That is not the way to resolve this matter and, with all due respect to the Minister, neither is posting an open letter on Facebook. We need a new round of talks.We need rationality, common sense, goodwill and respect for farmers and workers. All of this can be done but it will only be done through a new round of talks.

Those talks concluded this weekend with an agreement endorsed by the Minister, the meat industry and the six farm organisations representing the vast majority of farmers in this country. That is where we are today. The base price, as I explained earlier, is roughly the same across Europe. It is a market price, largely a function of supply and demand. There is no legal way to fix a price. That is not how it is done. It is not legal to do that. What is possible though is for farmers to join producer organisations which can then negotiate a price and proper contracts with the meat factories-----

That is the way it is done but that cannot be done at the moment when the factories are not operating. The factories need to be allowed to reopen. The producer organisations need to be allowed to negotiate contracts and prices. The figure I have is 3,500 - it may well be higher by now - but as many as 8,000 people could lose their jobs as a consequence of these protests and blockades.

Last year, the Government moved €1 billion from the strategic investment fund to the reserve fund for exceptional contingencies - the rainy day fund. The Government also pledged to put an additional €500 million into the fund this year. Can the Taoiseach confirm that at least €1.5 billion will be available to support jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Presumably, there would be more money available if it was not for the mishandling of the funding of the national children's hospital, the metro, rural broadband and so on. The time has come for the Government to give clarity in respect of the specifics of Brexit preparations. I spoke to trade union officials across the country during the summer. As I said publicly at the stakeholders forum during the week, we have been focused on the agrifood and tourism sectors, but in manufacturing the lack of certainty about Brexit is leading to a visible downturn in businesses. Important regional employers employing hundreds of jobs in each factory are under pressure. It is reported to me that orders have reduced, overtime is being cancelled and, in some circumstances, temporary workers are being let go. The impact of Brexit is being felt today.  It was reported that official estimates indicated that 10,000 jobs would be lost in tourism and hospitality. As the Taoiseach knows, the British Government was forced by the British Parliament to publish its yellowhammer report on the possible effects of Brexit across the British economy. Does the Taoiseach believe it is now time for his Government to publish its own detailed, clear analysis of a hard Brexit on every sector in our economy? How many jobs are at risk in manufacturing if the UK leaves in six weeks' time without a deal? How many other jobs across each sector of the economy are at risk? We need to know how much money we can deploy to sustain jobs in the short or medium term during this crisis. How much money will be available from the European Union in the event of a no-deal Brexit in six weeks' time? I would like the Taoiseach to address those questions in a very open way. How will money be made available to support vulnerable jobs? How much money will be made available? How much of it will come from Europe and from our own resources, and how will it be delivered? 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	38	I appreciate that for the next three weeks I will be asked questions about what is in the budget. I hope everyone in this House will appreciate that the answer will be that we will find out on budget day because the budget has yet to be agreed. It needs to be discussed among Ministers, with Fianna Fáil, as the confidence and supply partners to the Government, and at Cabinet. The only answer I can give people on what will be in the budget in three weeks' time is that they will find out on budget day because the budget will only be signed and sealed that morning. The public finances are in a strong position. Two years ago, when I became Taoiseach, our public finances were in deficit and they are now in surplus. We are one of the few countries in the world to record a budget surplus. They do not have one in the UK, in America, or in France but we are in surplus. We have also reduced the national debt considerably as a percentage of GDP in that period. We do not have a document equivalent to the Operation Yellowhammer document but have produced all that information already. It is in the Brexit contingency plan document we published in July, the document in December before that, in the summer economic statement, and in detailed analyses published by Government and done by Copenhagen Economics, the ESRI, and the Central Bank. All those figures are available, and have been for some time. We never had an Operation Yellowhammer-type document which we hid from people. We published the information all along the way. The budget is based on an assumption that no deal is a real possibility on 31 October. That does not mean that we necessarily believe that is going to happen. We will work to secure a deal until the very last moment but will not do so at any cost. We believe the prudent thing to do is to prepare the budget with a pessimistic scenario, which is one for no deal. The budget will prepare us for no deal. On budget day we will publish details of the package that will be available to business and to support those businesses and jobs that are vulnerable as a consequence of Brexit. It will be a substantial package. We do not yet know how much will come from the European Union or from our own funds. Some will come from the European Union but I expect most will come from own funds. Again, that is not as yet determined. The Deputy will know as soon as we know for sure. It is worth pointing out that we put many things in place already. There is a €300 million low-cost loan to businesses to allow them to prepare for Brexit. A future loan scheme is also being made available to businesses to allow them to adapt as is a €200 million approved restructure and rescue fund with approved state aid clearance from the European Commission to allow us to support those businesses which need it. The Deputy's question is correct in that there has not been an enormous take-up by business of these schemes as yet because they have not needed to take them up but they may need to and that is why it is important that they are there.

All of us in this House, and certainly those workers and employers across the country, understand that the preparations for a no-deal Brexit is not a normal annual budgetary issue. We need to know what the Taoiseach will deploy in terms of the strategic reserves we have in this country to ensure that the task of preserving jobs, which is far more useful than the task of trying to replace jobs, through this difficult period is understood. That means drilling into every industry to know where the jobs are vulnerable and what they might need. The sums talked about are paltry in the context of what will be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We also need to know on a workplace-by-workplace basis what the pressures are and what will be required. Many of these companies are not going to apply for loans because they cannot afford to provide for further demands right now, adding debt. That is not the solution. I want a clear indication from the Taoiseach that he understands the scale of what will be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit and that he has planned well for that and that he understands where and how resources will be deployed and how much resources will come from Europe and to help us.

We are on the same page here. I would rather be in a position that the country is borrowing money to save people's jobs than borrowing money to pay the dole. If that is what we have to do that is what we will do as part of the budget. I need to be honest with people as well.If we end up in a no-deal scenario, it will be a case of damage limitation. There may be some jobs and, regrettably, some businesses that cannot be saved but we will put together a package that will be significant and meaningful and will allow us to save those jobs and businesses that are viable in the long term but have been made vulnerable as a consequence of Brexit.

Despite many promises that funding would be provided in 2019 as part of the HSE capital plan, this funding has not materialised. Instead, parents and volunteers continue to provide funds and invest a huge amount of time and energy just to keep the doors of these vital services open. However, closure is still very much in sight and is facing several community-led organisations in Donegal. Lifeline Inishowen, for example, which provides support for women and children who experience domestic violence, is under constant threat of being shut down because, as a community-led organisation, it does not conform to the Government model of delivery of services. I raised this issue in my speech to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which coincided with the handing over of a petition signed by more than 1,000 Lifeline Inishowen supporters to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in Leinster House a number of months ago. No progress has been made to date, despite the fact that Lifeline has stepped in where the Government has consistently stepped out by providing a service in an area where the nearest available services are in Letterkenny, which is more than 60 km away and a two-hour round trip for those who find themselves in an emergency. Last year, Ireland finally ratified the Istanbul Convention, an international instrument to combat domestic violence, yet here we have an example of victims of domestic abuse being further marginalised by the Government. Among the tenets of the Istanbul Convention is that state parties implement comprehensive and co-ordinated policies involving Government agencies, non-governmental organisations as well as national, regional and local parliaments and authorities. We have also ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, yet iCARE, which is also based in Inishowen, faces a similar situation. The organisation was set up in 2000 and I had the pleasure of visiting its facility to meet the staff and service users. I saw at first hand the incredible work carried out by the iCARE project to provide much-needed educational, social and respite services for children with autism and their families. It was clear that this community-led model works. However, as has been the case across the country under this Government, funding is constantly running out and iCARE is constantly under threat of closure. This is despite the organisation being marked as value for money and the HSE using the facility and referring children to it. The Bluestack Foundation received €36,000 from the HSE in February with the understanding that it was an interim payment until the Estimates for 2019 were completed. However, it is still waiting for a Government response. Organisations such as the Bluestack Foundation and iCARE are in need of a serious sustainable funding commitment from the Taoiseach and the Government, particularly as the demand for their services is increasing all the time. The fact that these community-led services were established by concerned parents to service a particular local need and are under threat of closure says it all about the Government's priorities. Will the Taoiseach secure long-term multi-annual funding for iCARE, the Bluestack Foundation and Lifeline in order that these vital services can continue to provide important supports to local people, recognising the fact that we have ratified both the Istanbul Convention and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?

I am afraid I am at a disadvantage in that I did not know this issue was to be raised on Leaders’ Questions. As such, I do not have an up-to-date note on funding for either of the organisations but I will seek one and ensure it is passed on to the Deputy's office. On the wider question of domestic violence, the Government has ratified the Istanbul Convention and updated our laws on domestic violence. We are increasing funding for those organisations that support men and women who are victims of domestic violence and that will continue to be the case. I am very proud to have led the Government that at long last ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, we need to make that real. We now have record levels of funding going into disability services but the funding will never be enough and there will always be more to be done and needs to be met. However, as long as we manage the economy well and look after our public finances, we will be able to make things a little bit better every year by increasing funding for organisations that work with people who have disabilities and those who are victims of gender-based violence.

The current funding situation is as I outlined. That is the problem. There are no plans or support for these organisations. These organisations offer community-led responses to situations in respect of which the Government has not been providing a response. It is interesting that the Taoiseach referred earlier to how great it is that we have a budget surplus. He must realise, however, that what I am referring to is the price of that. We have a surplus because the Government does not support local organisations that are providing much needed services that it is neither providing nor funding. I would far rather have a budget deficit of 0.5% and have these services provided than having people standing here crowing about the fact that we have a budget surplus. Unfortunately, having such a surplus means that people are being put at risk. If the Taoiseach provides an update, I would like it to indicate that these organisations will be funded into the future.

As he will be aware, the budget that we are planning will increase public spending by approximately €2.8 billion next year. Some of that will be for health services, disability services and services for the victims of domestic violence. I would almost be tempted to send Deputy Pringle to meet the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on my behalf in order that he might suggest to it what may be the social consequences of running the bigger surplus it is demanding of us. The Government must strike a balance between listening to those who advise us to spend less and to build a bigger surplus in order to prepare for bad times that may come in the future and meeting the enormous demands and needs that exist across society. We must get that balance right and I think we do so.  In the context of the organisations to which the Deputy refers, I will seek information on their funding. I will consider the matter and ensure that the information is sent on to his office.

That has gone on for a long time. There was an interesting row over the summer between the Government and the Data Protection Commissioner in respect of a significant report by the commissioner following a two-year investigation into the processing of personal data for public services cards. I get the feeling there has been an attempt almost to demonise the Data Protection Commissioner in respect of her report. The commissioner has a particular remit and responsibility around the collection of data and how it is handled and managed. The Government and the Oireachtas should respect that, even if the commission annoys the Executive from time to time in terms of its objectives and agenda. I always felt it was fundamentally wrong to say it was mandatory to use a public services card to avail of other services. Citizens are entitled to services by dint of a basic entitlement, not because they have a particular card. The Minister at the time said it was mandatory but not compulsory, whatever that meant. The Data Protection Commissioner said basically that-----

The Government absolutely respects the Data Protection Commissioner but we do not agree with her findings on the legal basis for the public services card, which has been an extraordinary success. I will speak on that again some other time. It is important that due process and procedures are followed. The legislation passed by this Oireachtas provides for an appeal of any findings with which anybody disagrees. It is part of our democracy and part of our Constitution that there is a right of appeal.

The Taoiseach says the Department will publish the report of the Data Protection Commissioner on the public services card. The commissioner has found that important aspects of the card are unlawful. I do not think many of us were very surprised by that. I refer to the unlawful retention of the personal data of millions of citizens as well as the Government's planned demand that the card would be used to access State services. It is clear that the lawfulness of the intended use of the card is now seriously questioned. The expertise of the commissioner in this regard should be respected. It has been reported that the Government intends to challenge the commissioner's finding in court, which I find extraordinary. Given that this mess has already cost the taxpayer just shy of €70 million, saddling the public with additional costs of a court case seems like absolute madness. Can the Taoiseach confirm if it is, in fact, the Government's intention to take a challenge in this manner?

However, no document of legal standing has yet been served on the Government so we have to wait until there is an enforcement order issued by the Data Protection Commissioner before we can challenge any findings.No findings of legal standing have yet been made, but that may happen in the coming weeks. The public services card is a good thing. It is a success. The vast majority, more than 80%, of the people surveyed believe the public services card is a good thing. More than 3 million people have one already. The public services card is exactly what it says on the tin; it is a card that enables people to access public services. It was never intended to be just for social welfare services alone. The Data Protection Commissioner has found it is entirely lawful to make it mandatory for services provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including free travel-----

It was reported this morning that the Cabinet considered proposals to deal with new legislation from the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs to provide health and social care benefits to residents in Northern Ireland and British citizens who move to Ireland, arising from a no-deal Brexit. In January and February, as the Taoiseach knows, the Oireachtas spent a great deal of time fast-tracking omnibus legislation to deal with what we understood were all aspects that might arise from a no-deal Brexit. I presume this arose from further examination. Are there other pieces of legislation that might be required? Will we be briefed on anything that has been discovered? I attended all the stakeholders' meetings and it has never been raised there. Neither have we been briefed on any outstanding matters at the political meetings to date. Could the Taoiseach clarify, first, what specific legislative changes have been identified as being needed and if there will be more?

However, subsequent to that being enacted we made a commitment to do all that we could to extend the European health insurance card, EHIC, to all residents in Northern Ireland and also Erasmus+. We found a means of doing that but it is not perfect; it is a bit clumsy. The Minister for Health got approval this morning from the Cabinet to draft legislation. We intend to have that done by 31 October. That means that Irish, EU and UK citizens living in Northern Ireland will still be able to have their health expenses refunded should they require emergency medical services in another part of the European Union. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, also received approval this morning to ensure that UK residents in Ireland will still be able to avail of the national childcare scheme. They are the two legislative changes we decided on today. We believe there may be another one relating to family law, namely, to reduce the minimum living-apart period for spouses applying for a divorce to address the implications of a no-deal Brexit for the recognition of UK divorces. Other than those three, there are no other legislative changes that I am aware of at the moment, but if they arise we will inform the House.

Priority recommendation No. 3 of the Joint Committee on Climate Action's report, which was reached after painstaking negotiations and debates and having had to return to this issue, states:Starting immediately upon publication of this report –a) The Government should conduct a review to be completed by June 2019 into the most appropriate measure of, and the extent and nature of fuel poverty across all cohorts and to include in this review the short, medium and long-term impact on fuel poverty of the options for increasing the carbon tax.This has not been done.

I believe fuel poverty extends far beyond the definition of those in receipt of the fuel allowance. For example, does the definition cover the case of Clare Casey who worked for years cleaning the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and who was told last week by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, that she should not even bother applying for a grant to have her windows replaced because her income is about €10 a week above the threshold that would give her access to the fuel allowance? Tens of thousands of people will be hit by a reckless carbon tax. The reckless preparation for the budget is shown by the failure to conduct the recommended review, on which there was cross-party agreement. The committee sat day and night trying to agree the wording which I just read out. Not a single thing has been done about the review, apart from the Minister issuing a reply to me that he is involved in a project to develop energy poverty indicators. That reply is meaningless. The budget will be reckless if it does not deal with this issue.

The Taoiseach stated a number of times that there were six farm organisations in the room last week when the deal was made. There were seven of them. Is the Taoiseach not acknowledging the Independent Farmers of Ireland group, whose members are the people at the gates of the factories? I want them to be able to move away from the gates and allow the factories, including ABP in Cahir where 700 people are employed, to get back to processing. The Taoiseach must recognise these people and this is part of the problem. The Minister, Deputy Creed, did not recognise that group and had no bilateral engagement with it. Its members were in the room and they had to go back to meet farmers last night and on Sunday night in some places. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to reconvene the group and ensure there is a base price on offer? We can play around with bonuses and everything else until Christmas but there is no faith in that and no trust in the way the beef is graded and checked. People are weary at this stage. The workers have been displaced, including 350 at Cahir with another 180 to go, and the position is the same all over the country. We cannot prolong this issue. The Minister was lacklustre in calling the groups together but he did so last week. Will the Taoiseach recognise the Independent Farmers of Ireland and ensure the group is called back again?

I have made it clear that while I will look at the committee's recommendations, I will not consider restarting the whole process, as some have advocated in the recommendations they have made. It would not be fair to rural Ireland to ask people to wait a further five years for another tender process to be carried out. I am proceeding with all haste to try to ensure that all the due diligence that the Deputy would rightly expect me to undertake is undertaken in order that I am in a position to recommend to Government the signing of a contract.

This issue is troubling countries across the world as democracies are under real threat. Clearly, one of the responses to this is a strong media that can tell the difference between what is fake and what is real and tell our people with real clarity, honesty and independence what is happening in the world. In that context, this Government's throttling of RTÉ, with the ongoing decline in its funding model, and the Government's refusal to accept the recommendations our committee set for the proper funding of RTÉ and other Irish media are deeply worrying. We now possibly face the closure of RTÉ's studio in Cork, the closure of Lyric FM or the sale of more RTÉ land as it continues to sell capital assets just to cover current expenditure. When will the Government change its position of trying to kill this sector of the media-----

The reality is that the Government has been restoring funding to RTÉ. Last year it provided, I think, €10 million of additional funding to RTÉ as well as additional money to TG4. We believe strongly in the need for public service broadcasting and the importance of broadcasting, be it provided by public bodies or the private sector, and there are many excellent examples of public service delivery in the private sector. The Government established a working group following the report of the Oireachtas committee and I have acted on all the recommendations of that working group. We will put collection of the licence fee out to tender to reduce the rate of evasion and will move in due course to a model that is independent of the particular device a person has. The current model is linked exclusively to ownership of a television. We are acting on the recommendations. RTÉ is looking at the more structural changes that are happening and the Deputy cannot be blind to the fact that there are huge structural changes. If we want to see public service broadcasting delivered to a younger audience, we have to change the structures through which it is delivered. That is the work RTÉ is examining: how it can meet the needs of a changing environment for broadcasters.

As he is well aware, we have a state-of-the-art facility of which the people of Waterford can be proud, the new Dunmore wing of University Hospital Waterford, UHW, which will have 20 beds for the Waterford hospice. For the past 20 years the people of Waterford and the south east have engaged in massive fundraising to endorse €6 million towards this project. Unfortunately, the opening of the new hospice for the south east will be delayed until next year as the HSE has to allocate a budget to hire staff. This information came in reply to a question from Deputy Cullinane earlier in the year. The reply stated that staffing would happen when the budget was allocated.Once again, people are waiting and, unfortunately, they do not have time to wait when they are dying.

Local Deputies and I have raised this issue for some time. I commend the fact the building is now there and has been kitted out but the funding for staffing simply is not there. There is a state-of-the-art palliative care unit on the first two floors of this building and the top three floors have 72 acute beds. The problem is that the people who want to run and manage the service do not have the staff because they have not been given any funding to do so. My mam passed away this year in a palliative care unit in Harold's Cross in Dublin. Many people in the south east would want to be able to have their loved ones as close as possible when suffering from something. It is very important to the people of Waterford. How have we ended up with a building having been built, kitted out and provided with capital funding, yet it does not have the funding to recruit staff? Will the Minister commit to do that as soon as possible so that we can open this as soon as we can?

We intend to open three new palliative care facilities: the one the Deputy referred to in Waterford, one in Mayo, which the Minister, Deputy Ring, has communicated with me about, and one in Wicklow. I take the Deputies' points. The facility is there and we need to open it as quickly as possible. I hope that we can progress it this year. In the spirit in which we worked on other issues, I suggest that I meet the Oireachtas Members from Waterford next week, along with HSE officials, and we will see if we can move forward on it.

Will the Minister or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs be in a position to provide us with information on legislation to come before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs?

Unfortunately for a country that has punched above its weight in previous years, on this occasion, Ireland received only one of more than 400 such grants awarded. This is often seen as a barometer of the domestic system. It is no surprise. This is the inevitable outcome of the deliberate sidelining of basic research over the last decade, since the Government took office and the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government changed the law in 2012. People such as Professor Brian MacCraith of the Irish Universities Association have been to the fore, saying that the research sector is now in crisis. Basic research, primary research and early stage research need attention. The funding profile needs to be rebalanced. If not, we will not have the downstream research following on. Is the Taoiseach aware of these issues? If he is, what action does the Government propose to take?

It is anything but in crisis. In research and innovation last year alone, between private and Government investment, there was approximately €3.7 billion, €700 million more than what was given previously. As the Deputy is aware, most of our funding comes from Horizon 2020. We have taken in €700 million in funding from it. Our funding for research in industry is one of the highest rates in Europe, in proportion to population. I believe that, within the next months, we will have reached nearly €1 billion. Our 17 dedicated research centres are recognised across the world as being some of the best. Ireland is in the top ten for science research. One of our top research groups is in Tyndall National Institute in Cork. The Government has invested €70 million in it and it is now number one in the world for nanotechnology research. I will come back to the Deputy on the European research grant. I am not aware of the reason we did not compete more successfully. However, Ireland is way above average in terms of being competitive in research and our funding in that regard is among the best in Europe.

The Government backed away from it because of the intense media coverage it received. The matter in question is back on the agenda now. One group of workers that will be massively impacted upon if changes are made is the 600 miners at Tara Mines in Navan, the largest zinc mine in Europe. These workers carry out extremely dangerous and hazardous work. Unfortunately over the 40 years of operations, some miners have lost their lives in the process of extracting ore. Their flat-rate allowances allow for the reimbursement for special creams and other items used in the course of their work. I ask the Taoiseach to address this issue and to state whether he believes these workers should be supported by the State in the context of their entitlements. I invite him to visit Tara Mines, as some of his predecessors, including Brian Cowen, have done, to see operations for himself and to meet the miners.

The report came as no surprise to Members on this side of the House but the Government's response to it has been extraordinary. We have had so many different messages from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection who went into hiding in the first instance. She then refused to publish the report but subsequently stated that she would do so. However, her Department indicated last week that it would not be in the interests of the public to publish the report. It claimed that publishing would have a serious adverse effect on the ability of the Government to manage the economy. We still have not seen the report. The Taoiseach stated that it will be published today but we have not seen it yet. When will the report be published? The Government has also confirmed that it will be taking a legal challenge in respect of the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner and has cited the Attorney General and outside legal counsel in that regard. I ask the Taoiseach whether the Attorney General's report can be published because that would be very insightful, particularly if the Government is going to hide behind it.

However, he remarked in recent days, in the public domain, that anyone who took a quick glance at the law would conclude that the Government was justified in challenging the decision of the commissioner. The commissioner's office was established by statute to advise the Government on data law and data matters generally. The Taoiseach expressed generous praise for this and other parties for introducing legislation but that was precisely the legislation which the Data Protection Commissioner concluded does not allow the Government to act or misuse the public services card in the way it is attempting to do.

This is a democracy and anybody in a democracy can appeal a decision if he or she believes it to be incorrect. The Attorney General has looked at this matter and we also had third-party counsel examine it. They are all of the view that the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is robust and allows the public services card to be used as it was intended, namely, for public services and not just for services provided by one Department.

It had been scheduled to have a meeting on Monday, 1 July, but that had to be postponed because of an extended European Council meeting. The next meeting is not yet scheduled but will most likely happen next month. The Cabinet committee on the economy is responsible for all issues relating to the economy, including one of the Government's key strategies, Future Jobs Ireland, which was officially launched earlier this year. Progress is being monitored by my Department. Implementation is progressing and the first six-monthly report was published in July. Development of Future Jobs Ireland 2020 is now under way. Issues relevant to the agriculture sector were discussed at a number of Cabinet committees, including the Cabinet committee on the economy, which covers rural affairs, the Cabinet committee on foreign and European affairs, which covers Brexit, and the Cabinet committee on the environment, which covers issues relating to the environment, including the implementation of the climate action plan. Issues relating to the economy and to agriculture are, of course, regularly discussed at full Cabinet meetings, at which all formal decisions are made, including this week and last week.

It cited, in particular, the total disaster in terms of budget management, particularly in respect of health, as with projects such as the national children's hospital, and of housing. One point the Minister for Finance made last week was that there would be no income tax cuts this year - in other words, no increase in allowances or credits - at a time when wages are expected to rise by 3%. I have it directly from the chairman of IFAC that this will result in an additional €600 million for the Government. This is because workers will be earning more but not getting any tax reductions in terms of PAYE. Can the Taoiseach state what the situation will be for the hundreds of thousands of people affected, particularly pensioners, carers, those on long-term disability benefit, lone parents and others who rely on social welfare, social protection and retirement income? Will the Taoiseach tell us whether the indications of the Minister for Finance to the effect that there may be no improvements in social protection payments and retirement payments are true? There is to be an extra €600 million, coming in the main from PAYE workers, who would like to see people such as pensioners protected in the budget. This is also a really important point for the rural economy because we now have very large numbers of pensioners and young children. Inevitably, therefore, our costs are high as a country. Is the Government really talking about no social welfare increases? I welcome that the Minister for Finance seemed to confirm the Christmas bonus is unaffected, but that money is already in place for this year. Can the Taoiseach really say to the pensioners and carers that there will be no room in the budget for them?

I accept it is necessary to assert our tax sovereignty and demonstrate the impartiality of our own Revenue Commissioners. What is occurring, however, does outline that Ireland has become completely overdependent on multinationals for tax income. We are now in a position in which just 100 companies pay almost three quarters of the corporation tax collected. It is even questionable how much of this foreign direct investment actually benefits the real economy. The IMF has published some data on that. Like Fianna Fáil during the boom, the Government has used undependable corporation tax receipts to plug holes in the financial mismanagement of recent times. I refer to the over-expenditure we know about. In light of so many international economic uncertainties, does the Taoiseach agree it is now vital that we refocus our business and economic model on indigenous industries? Has the Taoiseach thoughts on this? How does he plan to ensure the indigenous economy is nurtured and grown so we can actually break away from overdependency on foreign direct investment, which represents a model that will probably not be sustained into the future?

I do not believe the Minister's intervention was helpful. It does not represent the kind of leadership required at this very sensitive point in this dispute. Those who are on the picket lines are women and men whose families in many cases have farmed for generations. The Minister's essential message, which is to shape up or ship out, was really quite disgraceful. Having delayed intervening in this dispute, which is a decade in the making, it really does not make any sense for the Government to further polarise the positions. No farmer wants to be on the picket line. They have a product to sell. Without sales, they have no income. Small farmers are no different from any other small business or micro-business; they need a minimum income. Our island is one of small indigenous businesses and micro-businesses. Small businesses are the beating heart of our economy. This includes our small farmers, our family farmers. As I acknowledged earlier, progress was made during the discussions but the very root of the dispute has not been addressed. Even within the restrictions of competition law, the matter of baseline price will need to be addressed and advanced. This is not a new issue. It is an issue that is resolvable. I ask the Taoiseach to consider supporting Sinn Féin's legislation to establish a beef market observatory to ensure full price transparency through the beef supply chain. This would provide a long-term solution to the very deep-rooted mistrust among small farmers of the processors. It is not controversial. It is deliverable even in the short time left under the confidence and supply agreement of the Fianna Fáil–Fine Gael Government. We need to get workers back to work and into the factories, and we need to get farmers back farming. This is a serious business that requires serious leadership. Social media do not represent an appropriate space for the Minister to conduct discussions, give advice or engage in negotiations. I hope he will reflect on that. I hope the Taoiseach will finally agree with me that now is the time for a new round of talks. There is no point in criticising farmers on the picket lines and lamenting the laying off of thousands of workers; we need to sit down and sort this out rationally and constructively. The core issue is baseline price. If we are not talking about that and if the Government is not prepared to resolve this, it is not serious about arriving at a solution.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	127	In recent weeks, there has been a series of leaks and anonymous briefings concerning the Government's approach to a range of economic issues, most of which are related to Brexit. People are calling the budget a no-deal Brexit budget. In reality, it is not. Brexit is providing good cover for a situation that is problematic in the sense that IFAC and the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and others have all signalled they are worried about the sustainability of our finances because of the corporation tax issue.Some recent articles, including a number published last weekend, were quite revealing in the context of the uncertainty surrounding these tax receipts. We could do with more detailed briefing on the source of the increase over the past two or three years, on its sustainability or fragility and on whether it is subject to all of the transfers that go on within multinationals regarding where intellectual property is booked, etc. This is a complex issue but, nonetheless, the Oireachtas requires some sense of what will happen over the next five years in respect of that revenue stream because - regardless of how one looks at the matter - it has been embedded into the base of expenditure in recent years. Lower interest rates than were thought likely three or four years ago have offset half of the potential interest that was, in 2015, forecast to accrue in 2018. On the other hand, there has been a substantial increase in corporation tax receipts over and above what was forecast. Will the Taoiseach confirm that his promise of a tax cut, which he announced at his party's Ard-Fheis and then promoted with a social media campaign, has been abandoned for this year? On the previous occasion on which this issue was raised with the Taoiseach, he confirmed his commitment to cuts next year and, in light of reasonable forecasts at the time in respect of 2020, attacked us for suggesting that such cuts were not affordable. Did the Minister for Finance talk to the Taoiseach before briefing to the effect that his tax cuts were unaffordable? I was also struck by comments made by the Minister for Health during a rare media appearance. The Minister was asked about the core management of and budget relating to the health service on Sean O'Rourke's radio programme. He stated that he is aware of the likely final spending figure for health this year - he actually said that - but he then essentially indicated that he is not willing to tell the public. Again, we are being denied basic information about the public finances and the amount of money available for critical public services. It appears that the actual figure for health expenditure in 2019 will not be available when the budget is introduced. We need more transparency on that because, as Mr. Tony O'Brien has stated, health expenditure has become a dark art. This is somewhat farcical in light of the disconnect between the demands or instructions given to the health service by Government and the funding being provided, particularly regarding demographic issues in respect of the elderly and all of the extra demands that come with a population that is ageing and living longer. On agriculture, we welcome the deal. There should be an opportunity to debate the agreement, which has come about belatedly. The Government was asleep at the wheel for far too long in the context of the beef sector and beef farmers. On the beef industry, many of the basic issues - such as the 30-month age restriction, four-movement rule, weight restrictions on cattle and the 70-day residency provision - could have been tackled much earlier, as could the establishment of a task force and dealing with other matters that are now encompassed within the agreement. In the overall interest of farmers, workers and all involved generally, space should be given to enable the deal to be taken on board.

I will speak first on the most recent report of IFAC. It is essential that Government take on board the advice of IFAC. The Opposition should also do so. Among the recommendations and findings the council put to us is a concern about the surge in corporation profit tax. We were only taking in approximately €3 billion a few years ago. That figure has risen to €10 billion. Some of that money may be unsustainable. I will come to that a little later. The council also expressed concern about in-year increases in spending, particularly in the area of health. We are doing our best to work with the new CEO and board of the HSE to rein in such spending this year in order that any overrun will be much lower than in previous years. When we talk about reining in health spending, it is important to explain what that means. It means only spending €1 billion more this year than last year. It means keeping the increase in spending to between 5% and 6%. That is what we are trying to do. It is often represented as cutbacks, but that is not what is happening at all. The council also recommended that we run a bigger budget surplus. As we all know, that would mean higher taxes, less spending, or a combination of the two. The Government does not agree with that recommendation. We believe that our projected surplus for this year, which is approximately 0.3% or 0.4% of GDP, strikes the right balance between what is needed in extra spending on infrastructure and public services and the goal of running a surplus. Ireland is one of the few countries in the western world that is running a surplus. I am not sure which parties in the House are advocating higher taxes, less spending, or both, so I am not sure if any party agrees with that particular recommendation from IFAC. The chairman of IFAC expressed an interest in reviewing the fiscal plans of Opposition parties, which is something similar councils in other countries do. That is a very good idea. I welcome confirmation from the leaders of the Opposition parties that they would like to have their budgetary plans examined-----

Every year an extra €600 million comes in as a consequence of not indexing rates and bands. A tax package of €600 million a year would be entirely reasonable and far from reckless if this was a normal budget. This is not a normal budget, however, it is being developed on the basis of planning for the possibility of no Brexit deal being reached. The latter will mean higher unemployment and, unfortunately, money will have to be found to pay the increased costs that will arise. It will mean growth and income growth moderating, which will unfortunately wipe out the €600 million very quickly. We need to focus the resources we have on saving jobs and businesses and making sure that as many people as possible get through the worst of a no-deal Brexit. There will be a tax package in the budget but, as the Minister for Finance has stated, it will be minimal. There will also be a social welfare package in the budget but, as the Minister for Finance has indicated, it will be modest and focused on those most in need. The Minister for Finance and I jointly made the decision, with the approval of Cabinet thereafter, that the budget should be developed on the basis of no deal and that we would not be able to proceed with the kind of tax package or welfare package that we were able to deliver in previous years. We made that decision jointly, just as we made a decision on Fine Gael's tax policy jointly. Notwithstanding the efforts to suggest the contrary-----

However, digital technology now encompasses so many aspects of our day-to-day lives that anything which could disrupt our use of these technologies must be taken more seriously than may have been necessary a few years ago. This is reflected in the sixth national risk assessment, which was published earlier this year, in which the significance of the risk associated with cybersecurity has been increased since last year. The introduction of the general data protection regulation a little over a year ago also requires that personal data are "processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data". As is common to many types of business, regardless of their size or the industry within which they operate, my Department is hugely reliant on its information and communications systems. These underpin much of our work. When IT systems are being designed or considered for use in the Department of the Taoiseach, they are designed and considered in the context of minimising any interruption to the service which they will provide. This is with a view towards business continuity, disaster recovery and the security of the system. My Department works with several suppliers that specialise in the areas of cybersecurity and information security. There is also ongoing contact with the computer security incident response team in the National Cyber Security Centre, which provides regular guidance and advice relating to current Internet security alerts and threats. Preventative measures recommended by the response team are taken seriously and are reviewed when they are received with appropriate action then being taken. Cybersecurity should not be seen as solely a technical discipline. Building resilience to cyber-based attacks continues to be a challenge for businesses, individuals, the public sector, and society in general. My Department provides advice and guidance to all staff on reasonably common cybersecurity threats such as phishing and ransomware which may be received through email or through other digital channels.This is intended to offer guidance while in work but can be applied equally at home, where digital technologies and Internet-connected devices can be just as common, if not more common. The response to cyber threats continues to be a whole-of-Government challenge with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment leading on the development of a new national cybersecurity strategy. A public consultation took place recently on the development of the new strategy, which will seek to take account of heightened threats, new responsibilities and the need to develop new skills and wider engagement internationally.

The Taoiseach indicated to the House previously that the report of the Data Protection Commission on the public services card would be published today despite calls by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection during the summer for it to be suppressed. I am glad that this decision has been arrived at. The public services card contains highly personal data relating to health information, educational records and, we understand, interactions between State bodies. We also understand from the leaks of the report that the commission has stated that retained documents with personal data must be destroyed. The public has an absolute right to know whether this is actually happening and to have personal data protected. The determination by the Data Protection Commission must be respected by the Government. This is the important matter that I wish to discuss. We have a Data Protection Commission that will regulate important data, not only for the citizens of this State, but for citizens across the EU, given that so many multinational companies are based in Ireland. It is an important signal that the determination of the commission is fully respected. If it is the point of view - I understand that it might well be - that the broadening of the use of the public services card is a legitimate objective of the Government, surely the right way to move forward is, if it is not covered by current legislation, to introduce amending legislation and seek the sanction of the Houses. That would be a much better way to go than giving encouragement to others who might not like future decisions of the Data Protection Commission and would then be able to cite the Government as a body that took legal challenges. Instead of simply appealing a report that the Government disagrees with, which would be fine, will it address the essence of the report, that being the lack of a legal underpinning for what the Government is doing, and introduce amending legislation in the House in order to seek the authority of this and the Upper House to achieve the Government's objective?

As the Taoiseach knows, various avenues of criminal and civil law can be used to a limited degree, but they fall well short of what is needed to deal with cyberharassment. Women's Aid suggests that a specific all-encompassing law is needed that enables the courts to assess the various types of cyber offences as a pattern as opposed to having different tactics prosecuted under different Acts. The Opposition has constructively engaged in this broad area of protecting women and children from online harassment and violence. There are a number of Opposition Bills stuck in the legislative process because Ministers have promised legislation that has yet to appear. Sinn Féin introduced legislation to promote and encourage measures to improve digital safety for all persons, with a specific focus on so-called revenge pornography. My colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, has introduced legislation that provides for a stand-alone office of digital safety commissioner with online safety as its key area of work. Critically, the office would be responsive to the ever-changing landscape of digital safety. The Taoiseach knows that the Opposition benches will work with the Government on legislation where we share common cause. Cybercrime legislation is needed to give effect to the provisions of the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, which is not currently provided for in legislation. This legislation has long been promised by the Government and is much needed. We want legislative solutions in place that protect all from online harassment, violence and crime. When will the Minister for Justice and Equality publish the Government's cybercrime Bill?

Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House the strength within our Defence Forces in terms of cybersecurity and their capacity, given their retention and recruitment crisis, to deal with a cybersecurity threat? My information is that there has been some migration of personnel from the military to the civilian departments because the pay there is higher and that, to a certain extent, the capacity within our Defence Forces has been reduced and diluted on a consistent basis in this and other areas of specific expertise that the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps require. Will the Taoiseach comment on this matter and the particular strengths that our Defence Forces have in terms of contributing to Ireland's protections against cybersecurity attacks? I raised a matter relating to the Data Protection Commission on the Order of Business. There has been an unhealthy response to the commission's report. First, there was a reluctance to publish it early enough during the summer. Second, it was suppressed, although it is being published today. We in this House, including the Executive, need to understand and reflect more on the reasons the Data Protection Commission would issue the kind of report that was issued. Whereas the public services card may be desired and something with which people agree, the Government cannot dictate to the citizens of this country that, just because it thinks the card is a good idea and it will harvest and collect all of their data, their use of the card must be mandatory or compulsory if they want to avail of other services outside of those provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. On the face of it, it seems that the Government and the Department have acted illegally. Of course, they can challenge that and say that they did not, but I would have preferred a more intelligent discussion around the Data Protection Commission's report instead of a knee-jerk reaction that was more about trying to undermine the commission's judgment and the conclusions of the report and to pour scorn on that office, which raises major concerns in the broader perspective. The modern economy and society are about data and the harvesting of same. We must be extremely careful with the rulebook and legal and regulatory framework that we create for it. The Government cannot just lecture and hector those in the private sector about data. It must also be seen to be acting in accordance with best principles.

It is being published alongside a response from the Department. I think that is a good thing because people only heard one side of the story in August. Being able to see the report as well as the Department's response will, I hope, allow for an intelligent and reasoned discussion about the content of the report and also the Department's response to it. I hope that both will be read and considered together. To the best of my knowledge, the public services card does not contain any health information, and I do not think it contains any educational information either. The data sent forward are actually quite limited.

It is a success. It is very popular. We know from surveys of people who have one - I have one - that over 80% of people like it, particularly those who now use it as a free travel pass, elderly people in particular. It is designed to make public services more accessible, for greater efficiency and for removing duplication. It is also designed to reduce fraud, but that was only ever a small part of the project.In terms of accessing public services more easily, it means that people only have to fill in a form, go to the chemist and get photographs, which need to be signed and stamped by a garda once every seven or eight years.  It has also brought about efficiencies. One does not need a separate travel pass, pension book and social welfare services card because all those things can now be replaced with one card, which is much more efficient. It has been helpful with fraud - not so much detecting fraud but certainly deterring it. We know that the instances of confiscation of false travel passes has gone down dramatically since the public services card travel pass was introduced. I acknowledge the role of the Labour Party, which ran the project for five years, Deputy Burton having introduced the card and Fianna Fáil having introduced legislation before that.

It is not, because Fine Gael has only had control of that Department for approximately three years. The public services card was an all-party effort and debates in the past show that all parties were very much in favour of it. The concept of the public services card was first launched in 1998. It does exactly what it says on the tin - it is a public services card. It is not only for social welfare services but for public services in general. It is absolutely not an identification card. It is prohibited in law for the gardaí to ask somebody to produce it. The whole point of a national identification card is that police can ask one for it. That has been prohibited in law and neither the Garda nor any private sector body can ask for it. The law contains a schedule of the exact public sector bodies that can ask for and use the card.

It is important to communicate across a variety of platforms, including social media, to ensure transparency and clarity for all citizens. The Government information service is now required to provide 24-7 services to media organisations on all topics of public interest and with short response times. The social media channels for my Department are Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The central objective of these channels is to report objectively on the work of Government and, over time, to provide a valuable archive of information. The social media activity in the Department is governed by strict operating principles. The main operating principles governing the use of these social channels are that the content consists of news stories and press releases, speeches from me and from Ministers, photos and videos from Government events and my engagements, the live tweeting of Government events and other content as deemed appropriate. The use of social media platforms is not intended as a means of contacting me or the Department directly, or for the submission of press queries. Those activities are handled by other means. Following or retweeting another account does not imply an endorsement of any kind. All staff in my Department who update social media channels are bound by the Civil Service code and standards of behaviour.

People should not scare older people into feeling they may lose that because it is a valuable improvement to public services. I am getting tired and weary of the constant advertisements from Government stating that a particular thing is an initiative of the Government of Ireland. What is an initiative of the Government of Ireland? There was a time when we had a health service that could tell us the number of people it was going to treat and so on. We could feel that things were running along but we are now plagued with these rather soporific advertisements. There have been ugly scenes this week, unfortunately, in the lovely town of Oughterard. A Deputy of this House made comments about people of African origin who are in this country which have been deeply upsetting to many of our citizens and the Taoiseach has rightly called that out. Why is the Government doing so much social media communication but no communication with people in Oughterard about a potentially significant development in the town and one which does require communication? My fear about the social media profile of this Government is that it amounts to casual social media and advertising but no real communication, which means reaching out to people and communities and explaining what exactly is the thinking behind what the Government is doing, or not doing, and having discussions with people over proposed changes that will significantly affect people's lives. The BusConnects proposal is another example. Thousands of trees have been felled in Dublin's most tree-lined avenues. I attended a communication event last week with representatives from BusConnects. There was a map sitting above the heads of the three men who were representing BusConnects which was hard to work out. Those men were the team which was meant to advise and communicate with the public in the Taoiseach's constituency and mine and it made me wonder why this Government is so sharp in social media and advertising initiatives while it totally fails in real communication with citizens on things that affect their lives.

There is a consensus in this House and across the country that the business of policing harmful content on social media cannot be left up to the platform providers and that the days of self-regulation by social media are well past. The consensus in this House is that we urgently need an online safety commissioner to act in the public interest and it is essential that such a commissioner would be adequately resourced. Currently, at least one third of the EU's data are being managed in Ireland and yet the Data Protection Commissioner has only €15 million of funding. We must have the confidence of all of Europe that Ireland can do this job effectively on behalf of all Europe's citizens. Can the Taoiseach now provide an update on the progress of the two proposed pieces of legislation, one from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the online safety commissioner and one from the Department of Justice and Equality, namely, the legislation introduced by the Labour Party and accepted by the Government earlier this year? We thought the element which does not include the Data Protection Commissioner might be enacted. When will those two pieces of legislation be advanced and brought before the House?

People throughout the country are asking why all this activity was not in place at the start of this year. We have heard commentary that the advertising spend for this campaign appears to be heavily focused on telling the public that Ireland will be ready, rather than concentrating on the concrete targeting of the businesses which need the most help. Can the Taoiseach outline the basis upon which spending in this campaign was allocated between different approaches? Was any of the advertising reviewed with target groups to check that it was meeting their needs rather than promoting a generic Government message?We know that in March we were not ready. As it subsequently turned out, no deal could have happened at the end of March. We need full openness and honesty about the impact of Brexit generally. People should not be attacked just for asking questions about the state of preparedness for Brexit or calling for details of Border arrangements if a no-deal outcome were to emerge. I am hopeful that a no-deal outcome will not happen and that minds will concentrate because I believe a no-deal outcome is very bad news all around for the United Kingdom, the island of Ireland and Europe. It would be a collective failure all around if that were to materialise because many livelihoods would be affected. Could the Taoiseach answer the question as to the reason we still do not have an online safety commissioner? It has been two years. All parties in the House have supported that in various motions, including our party.

I advise the Taoiseach that as the clock ticks down and the pressure mounts, and as Boris Johnson and the British system are desperately fishing for an out, this is not the moment for the Head of Government in this State to think out loud or to make any proposition around customs and checks. There can be no customs or checks. It is academic where they would be located. There can be no hardening of the Border and no damage to the Good Friday Agreement. That is the strong negotiating position for this State and it is one we should collectively persist with. We should not approach this in a party political manner. The stakes are too high.

Wicklow town is one example and Lisdoonvarna is another where communities were engaged with. Some fears were allayed and some scare stories corrected. I am told that has not happened yet in Oughterard because any plans or proposals to accommodate asylum seekers in that particular town are only at the initial stages and are not developed to the point where the Department is in a position to consult residents. If the plans get to that point, I am sure it will happen. Wicklow town and Lisdoonvarna are very good examples of where there may have been an initial reaction which was negative but now people have come around and welcomed people from other countries into their towns. The information campaigns around BusConnects have been run by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. I know from my constituency work that there has been a deficit in public communications in that regard but I believe both those transport bodies will take on the concerns of the general public and will make changes to BusConnects, in the same way that they made changes to the metro alignment. It is Government policy to establish an Internet safety commissioner. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is working on the legislation. If I recall correctly, in the legislative programme we approved at Cabinet this morning the Bill is down for publication in this parliamentary session and before Christmas. In terms of the Labour Party legislation - Deputy Howlin's legislation - the Government very much supports it and we will co-operate with the Labour Party in getting it through. I am not sure exactly what stage it is at.

I will check with him to see if we can get it done in this session also. On the public information campaign on Brexit, that is run through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Until now, it has been largely business-focused. People have heard the business-focused advertisements on radio and online. In addition, the extra Revenue staff have been ringing businesses individually. More than 90% of businesses, by volume of trade, now have EORI numbers. They have been written to and there have been follow-up phone calls. Just the other day, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through the Companies Registration Office, CRO, contacted 220,000 businesses. We now need to shift the focus to more citizen-focused information. What do I do with my driving licence and my insurance? What happens when I arrive at an airport? Do I go through the blue, green or red channel? Those are the practical issues people need to know about. That will be ramped up in the next few weeks. I believe March is different from October. I do not believe one can ever be 100% ready for Brexit but we were as ready as we could be back in March and we are as ready as we can be now. The difference in March was that Prime Minister May always expressed her intention to seek an extension if we could not get a deal ratified. Indeed, the Cooper-Boles law passed by parliament required the Prime Minister to seek an extension. Prime Minister Johnson's approach is very different. He is saying that he will not seek an extension and that the UK will leave with or without a deal. He is also suggesting that in some way the British Government may be able to get around the Benn legislation passed in recent weeks. I think the position is different now.

We respect this decision, and we have been consistent in all interactions with the UK Government making clear that our preferred outcome is a deal on the basis of the withdrawal agreement. We are of course open to realistic, legally binding and workable alternatives but in the absence of such alternatives, the British Prime Minister's proposal to abolish the backstop is unacceptable. Notwithstanding our differing perspectives, and continued uncertainty in relation to the manner of the UK's departure, I and my Government colleagues are maintaining regular contact with our UK counterparts. The Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister last week, and over the last month, I have met the Foreign Secretary, the Brexit Minister, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, including last night when I hosted the Secretary of State for dinner in Dublin. It is clear the UK’s decision to leave the EU will change fundamentally the nature and frequency of our bilateral interaction. I am conscious of the importance of protecting existing co-operation and of providing opportunities for mutually beneficial co-operation and relationship-building in the future, for obvious reasons. The existing, carefully balanced Good Friday Agreement structures for British-Irish co-operation are vital in this regard, namely, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, and the British-Irish Council, BIC. These institutions now need to be utilised to the fullest extent possible. At last November's meeting of the intergovernmental conference, a joint paper outlining a possible model to maintain bilateral co-operation post Brexit was discussed, including regular Taoiseach-Prime Minister-level summits, and ministerial and official-level dialogue. The importance of such future structures was also discussed at the latest BIIGC meeting in May, and will be revisited by the current UK Government in the coming period and advanced as required in the context of broader developments. Our embassy in London - our largest bilateral embassy - and our consulates in Edinburgh and Cardiff remain essential to sustaining ongoing dialogue, and the Government is committed to opening an additional consulate in Britain in the coming years. The relationship between Ireland and the UK is and will continue to be a unique, vital, and complex one. It is a relationship which requires great care, close attention and ongoing engagement at every level.

Our two countries are going in different directions and are at odds over the manner in which the UK will exit the EU. This presents difficulties for the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement, and maintaining the all-island economy, to name but a few. It is imperative, despite the obvious difficulties, that the British and Irish Governments continue to engage constructively with one another. Governments must lead from the front and set the tone for Anglo-Irish relations. Moreover the relationship underpins the peace process and there is an onus on both Governments to ensure that they work collectively and adhere to their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. Historically, it has been the two Governments that have always been the engines and catalyst for driving the talks and getting things done. It is imperative that the same impetus continues from both Governments. Furthermore, we cannot allow Brexit suck all of the oxygen from Anglo-Irish relations. Anglo-Irish relations are much more than just Brexit. Our countries are deeply entwined, economically, socially and culturally and will remain so in the post-Brexit environment. Ireland needs to actively nurture this relationship. Last November the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference discussed a joint paper outlining a possible model to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between Ireland and the UK post Brexit. This commitment was reaffirmed at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in May of this year. Officials on both sides have commenced the process of turning these ideas into a practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future east-west co-operation. Can the Tánaiste give the House an update on this, please?

We had a very good engagement on that issue. Both sides recognised that the EU post Brexit will be very different. We are simply not going to see British Ministers as often because they will not be around the EU negotiating tables with us. Even with the Good Friday Agreement structures, there was an acceptance on both sides that we needed to go beyond that. The idea that we were developing at the time - David Lidington and I were the key people co-chairing the BIIGC - was that we were developing this concept which some other EU countries have, for example, France and Germany, and Portugal and Spain, whereby they would have an annual intergovernmental conference-engagement. We would look to do that every second year in the UK and Ireland, led by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister but also involving at least half a dozen Ministers in key areas. We are still committed to that approach. There has of course been a change in British Government and personalities. I am hoping that we will have a BIIGC in the next six weeks or so and that we can get back to focusing on that new structure in terms of making it happen.

Brexit is one of the greatest threats and challenges we have faced in a generation. My biggest concern is of the possibility of the hardening of the Border on this island. This is completely unacceptable. Can the Tanáiste provide us with an update on his negotiations with the European Commission on this issue? Can he clarify what checks he is discussing with the Commission, where they will be located, and what their purpose will be?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	192	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 41 together. Avoiding the return of a hard border on this island is a Government priority in all circumstances. This is why the backstop continues to be a critical component of the withdrawal agreement, unless and until an alternative is found. Ratifying the withdrawal agreement remains the only viable solution on the table that avoids any physical infrastructure and related checks or controls, fully protects the Good Friday Agreement, safeguards North-South co-operation, and preserves the all-island economy, as well the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland’s continuing place in it. No one has yet come up with any alternatives aimed at avoiding a hard border that match what is safeguarded by the backstop. Given the current political uncertainty in London, there is a significant risk of a no-deal Brexit. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, there are no easy solutions. We continue our work with the European Commission to address the shared twin objectives of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, and protecting the Single Market and Ireland’s place in it. I can assure the Deputy I am absolutely conscious of the Good Friday Agreement and its spirit and the challenge that we face. However, a no-deal Brexit will unavoidably mean far-reaching change in North-South trade on the island of Ireland, which will certainly no longer be as frictionless. Tariffs would apply and the impact of customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, requirements and associated checks necessary to protect Ireland's place in the Single Market would be significant to the operation of the all-island economy. We continue to work closely with the Commission to minimise the negative consequences of no deal but any arrangement would clearly be sub-optimal to the backstop, which is why we are such strong advocates for that approach based on regulatory alignment. It is also important to remember that even in a no-deal scenario, certain key aspects of life will not change. The common travel area will remain in place, so British and Irish citizens will still be able to travel freely between our two islands to live, work, study and access healthcare, welfare, housing and the labour market as though they were citizens of both. However, the Deputy asked directly where we were with the European Commission regarding the detail of what can be agreed with the European Commission in the context of a no-deal Brexit, with the twin objectives I outlined earlier. That process has not concluded yet. Our team met the European Commission last week. They are meeting the Commission again this week and we are now talking directly about how we can minimise the disruption to the all-island economy while ensuring that the Republic of Ireland does not get taken out of the EU Single Market by default by not doing anything or not doing enough, while at the same time recognising that we have to protect North-South co-operation, the Good Friday Agreement and its structures and the benefits of all-island trade as best we can. If the British Government decides to trigger a no deal by refusing to compromise or to live up to the commitments it has already made in the past, and if a British Parliament allows that to happen, we face very difficult choices. However, the priorities will be as I outlined, protecting an all-island economy on the one hand because it is a reinforcer of peace and, at the same time, ensuring that Ireland is not taken out of the Single Market by default against its will. However, that will involve difficult choices and a very open discussion in this Chamber in terms of how and why we have made those choices. I hope I will get the support of colleagues in our attempts to get that fragile balance right should it come to it.

It remains the bottom line in terms of the very minimum that is needed to protect our economic interests and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. As 31 October approaches and pressure mounts, we ask that the Government does not blink in the face of Tory intransigence and the recklessness of Boris Johnson's Government but we also need to be clear there can be no return to a hard border. There is consensus in the House on that. There can be no more division on the island. As for the idea of having customs checks, there is concern about a return to customs checks at the Border. The Tánaiste mentioned the Good Friday Agreement: it is the Irish people's agreement and an international agreement passed by huge majorities. We understand the importance the European Commission places on protecting the Single Market but that cannot come at any cost or at the cost of the Good Friday Agreement. Our job is not to negotiate the imposition of a Border on the island of Ireland. We need to agree on that. That should not be our job with respect to the European Commission. It is our job to work with our European partners at all costs to prevent this disastrous scenario emerging for the future of peace on this island. I have a few questions. The Irish people will not accept any return to or a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland as a result of that but does the European Commission and our European partners get that?

First, and I said this earlier, Ireland will not support any deal that involves us acquiescing to the reintroduction of Border infrastructure on the island. That cannot be the compromise that gets the deal across the line because essentially what we would be doing is moving away from regulatory alignment as the way of solving this problem towards trying to manage Border infrastructure and trying to limit the damage as best we can. We have an approach to solve this problem, albeit on a temporary basis but for as long as necessary until other solutions emerge. It is called the backstop. It can be UK-wide or it can be Northern Ireland-specific – we do not mind. That commits to ensuring there is a level playing field and common rules on both sides of Border on this island to ensure we do not have to put checks in place again, whether they be on the Border or anywhere else for that matter. That was the commitment in terms of the approach back in December 2017. It was also the commitment in the withdrawal agreement that got supported. We want to try to find a way of ensuring that commitment is followed through on. If the British Government wants to replace the backstop, it must replace it with something that does the same job. That is our position. Our position in a no-deal scenario is that we will need to put temporary emergency solutions in place that protect our place in the Single Market while we continue to negotiate and advocate for more comprehensive solutions.

It is understandable and reasonable that Opposition parties, businesses, farmers and citizens are asking the Government in the event of a no-deal Brexit what will happen on 1 November. I listened to Joe Healy of the IFA being interviewed this morning from the National Ploughing Championships in Carlow. He was asked the same question, namely, did he or his members know what type of situation farmers will face on 1 November. His frank answer was that they did not and that they have been asking for that clarity. Therefore, that question is not coming from only inside this House. There was commentary from the Government in the past few weeks, first, an admission that checks would have to happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit but there has been no further detail. I appreciate we have had conversations about this and it is an uncomfortable topic for the Government. However, with respect to commentary from the Taoiseach that checks would happen away from the Border, near the Border, some at the ports and some at the point of arrival, with just over six weeks to go, it is reasonable to ask the question what is plan B in the event that a deal is not passed. We all hope and share the Tánaiste’s optimism that a deal can be done. Of course, it can be done, but the default position remains a no deal. The line and message consistently coming from Brussels is that the most likely outcome still remains a no-deal Brexit. I read with considerable concern this morning that at the Cabinet meeting today the Tánaiste was directing Ministers in other Departments to prepare their no-deal plan for the first 24 hours, basically for 1 November.

Let me explain what happened here. We made a conscious decision with the European Commission that we would not finalise what would essentially be an emergency management plan in a no-deal scenario in terms of facilitating trade on this island if Northern Ireland is outside the customs union, the Single Market and the European Union and the rest of the island is very much in it and wanting to protect its place in it. For good reason when it became obvious a number of months ago that there would be an extension, the European Commission and our team agreed we would pick this up again over the summer because these are unpalatable and politically controversial issues. The idea that we would publish a plan months out, when there is a good chance we could avoid a no deal, and create all the damage, friction and anxiety that would come from plans like this does not seem to make much sense to me. We have had an honest conversation over the summer with the Commission. It is now moving into detailed discussions in terms of what is the bare minimum we need to do to limit disruption to protect Ireland’s place in the Single Market in a no-deal scenario. We will explain to people how we think that will work once we have the agreement with the Commission. It would have been crazy to have done this months ago and to have all the politics around this issue focus on it, and some people trying to latch on to it as an alternative arrangement that may be somehow okay, which it clearly is not. It is significantly sub-optimal to a regulatory alignment approach that prevents the need for Border infrastructure at all. I can assure the Deputy we will be upfront about it once we get an agreement with the Commission around what we need to do and the timelines for that because both of those things are important and we will share it with Opposition Members when we can.

The Government states that it could not produce a plan months out from Brexit, which is only six weeks away now. People are asking if there is a plan B and, if so, when they will see the shape of it. The Tánaiste has stated that this will happen when there is agreement with the Commission. When will that be? Will it be next week or the week after? Will it be the week Brexit is due to happen? People are extremely worried about the direction in which this is going. We need to reassure them. We also need people to realise that there is a possibility of a no-deal Brexit and that they should be prepared for it. That is key. I welcome that the Tánaiste recently informed the Cabinet about the no-deal Brexit plans in the various Departments. As I have mentioned to him, both privately and in public, I also believe that there is a role for the Dáil in respect of this matter. We have a part to play. Does the Tánaiste have a view on revisiting the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019? How does the Government propose to keep the Dáil on board in respect of this discussion? We want to be kept updated, not only in private rooms but also in this Chamber. We need to be telling people at home exactly what is coming down the track.

At this point, however, with 44 days - just over six weeks - to go, it is reasonable to start releasing those plans and pushing the Commission to give a verdict on the Government's proposals. One of the issues referred to either last week or a week and a half ago is that of a grace period. It might alleviate some of the concerns if there was some detail on what kind of a grace period would be involved. In terms of implementation, are we talking days, weeks or months? Discussing details of potential checks either near or away from the Border will not provide any sort of reassurance to people but it would provide a degree of clarity and certainty in what is an uncertain environment. That is what businesses are seeking. I also do not buy into the idea that if we start discussing our plan B - what we would do in an emergency - this would somehow equate to our putting forward an alternative arrangement. The backstop is not as good as the UK remaining in the European Union. An alternative arrangement is supposed to do exactly what the backstop will do but putting infrastructure or checks in place in particular locations is clearly not the same. Doing the latter would give rise to a much inferior outcome. In the context of equating the two, I just do not see a link. With just over six weeks to go, clarity is needed, even in the context of the grace period. If businesses and farmers knew that they would have two months' or three months' grace, it might remove some of the stress.

The Minister formally opened the new Colombian embassy in Dublin yesterday and we opened an embassy in Bogota in the past 12 months. The relationship between our two countries is closer than ever before. The Minister is very welcome. I look forward to visiting Colombia, hopefully at some point in the next six to nine months. Deputy Crowe is correct about the concerns of those in Border communities. I have met many of them. This is a cause of real anxiety. When I say that we will not sign up to a compromise deal that essentially involves acquiescing to introducing infrastructure on or near the Border, I mean it. I say that because of the concerns of the people to whom I refer. We need to be firm, if respectful, and state that we expect the UK to honour the commitments it has given to Ireland and the EU during the negotiations. We must also indicate that we will not allow a situation whereby, in order to solve a difficulty at Westminster, we would create a significant problem for Ireland for the foreseeable future and that the Border would dominate politics here again. We all thought we had left the latter behind two decades ago. In the context of a decision the UK - not Ireland - has made, it is not unreasonable to request that Irish interests in this regard be protected. It is in the context of a no-deal scenario - when we may be forced to make difficult decisions in order to protect both our place in the Single Market and the Good Friday Agreement - we must state that we regard any arrangements put in place as temporary while we continue to negotiate in respect of the same issues on which we are negotiating now. The EU has made it clear, through a European Council decision, that no formal trade negotiations between the EU and UK will be opened until the three issues in the withdrawal agreement - citizens' rights issues, the financial settlement and the Irish Border question - are addressed in full. We will continue our campaign, if necessary through a no-deal, to try to protect this island against the political impact on communities of the reintroduction of Border infrastructure. I will try to answer Deputy Crowe's question on what the House can do in respect of Brexit in the context of a later question on the matter.

As stated earlier, we have been actively preparing for Brexit in order to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all scenarios. Our consistent message has been that a no-deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on many levels. This is why we have published two comprehensive contingency action plans - one in December last and one in July - setting out the impact of a no-deal Brexit and the work being done to mitigate these risks, held over 1,200 stakeholder preparedness events in all key sectors right across the country, enhanced physical capacity at our ports and airports - Dublin Port alone has spent over €30 million to date - provided training and financial supports to increase our customs capacity, recruited additional staff in key areas and included dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. Appropriate funding supports for businesses have been an important pillar of the Government's preparations for Brexit and dedicated measures have been made available in the previous three budgets. Budget 2019 measures included the introduction of a new longer-term loan scheme of up to €300 million to which the Taoiseach referred earlier and the future growth loan scheme to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates for terms of eight to ten years. This is in addition to announcements in previous budgets where over €450 million was allocated in business supports, including budget 2018's €300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has stated that budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit, that the Government will make provision for timely, targeted, temporary measures for the sectors most exposed and that will involve a considerable amount of money. The Government has been clear that, in its approach to this year's budget, it is important to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario. This approach underlines why it is so important that exposed businesses in particular prepare for no deal. To support businesses in this, we recently launched the Getting Your Business Brexit Ready - Practical Steps campaign which focuses on nine steps every business - large and small - should take now to help prepare for Brexit. At this week's National Ploughing Championships, a dedicated Brexit hub will engage directly with businesses and citizens to ensure that they are taking all the steps they should. The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I cannot give her an exact number. In three weeks' time, however, she will certainly get the answer to that when the Minister for Finance outlines his budget.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	214	I have consistently asked about the financial supports that will be made available to the most vulnerable sectors.I refer to agrifood and agriculture, tourism and haulage. I was particularly concerned last week to read the report published by EY that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, rural communities could see themselves going into recession-type scenarios. Clearly, those communities will need direct supports. I refer also to reports from Fáilte Ireland that we could be facing about 10,000 job losses in the tourism sector. We know the impact on the agrifood sector would be in the region of 12,500 jobs. These jobs are predominantly in rural communities across the country. There is no alternative employment outside of these sectors in many areas. It is really important that there are targeted supports for them. I understand the Minister for Finance will be directing his budget towards Brexit. There are concerns that he has indicated he will need to borrow money in order to fund vulnerable sectors in the event of a no-deal Brexit. I am also concerned to see a report from the Central Bank today that a third of farms in this country could be at risk of no longer existing in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There are particular problems in agriculture that must be addressed. Even though some Brexit supports have been made available, just 11% of the combined €600 million in Brexit loan funds that have been made available has been drawn down or sanctioned. That leaves €533 million in Brexit loan funding that has not been touched. That is a problem.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	215	On the Deputy's last question, in order for funds to be drawn down, people have to apply for the funds. A lot of these funds have been put in place as a contingency measure. Many businesses now know that they exist. They may well decide not to apply for them until they have more certainty about the outcome of Brexit. Many small businesses, as the Deputy knows, are not going to trigger significant extra costs or expenditure unless they know they have to do it. Many larger businesses have already put in place a no-deal Brexit plan and are now proceeding accordingly, particularly in the pharma sector. I have spoken to a number of them. They have spent very considerable sums of money but they can afford to do so. Many smaller businesses cannot. That is why we have introduced what is essentially grant aid to help businesses put a Brexit plan in place. InterTradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland have Brexit supports to help businesses get outside advice if they need to. The Deputy is right that while some money has been sanctioned, many businesses will wait to trigger contingency plans until they have more certainty as to whether we are moving into a transition phase for the next two to four years or are going to be dealing with the disruption of a no-deal Brexit. The other issues the Deputy raised are very fair. Undoubtedly, agrifood and farming are vulnerable sectors given the volumes of food and drink we export to the UK and the impact of tariffs on them. Tourism and fishing are also very vulnerable sectors and this will be very much to the fore of the Government's thinking as we put the budget together.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	216	Tourism, agrifood and fisheries essentially are the west of Ireland. That is our most vulnerable region. It cannot take the hit and is going to need direct supports, immediately. It will not be sufficient for supports to be delivered three or six months after the event happens. They need to be ready to go pretty quickly in the event that the worst does happen. On the third of farms that may go under in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Central Bank, when asked this morning if direct supports should be provided where those farms are viable, answered that they should. To get these businesses and sectors over the initial hump and to try to survive the initial impact of a no-deal Brexit, direct supports will be required immediately. It was disappointing to see that the Government line had shifted slightly. Initially we were led to believe there would be significant funds from the European Union to help Ireland deal with the worst impact of Brexit. It now appears that the State will be picking up most of the tab. Other member states will be affected but we will be the most affected. It is a reasonable request from Ireland as a member of the bloc, the European Union and the wider community to ask for support. That help and support would be forthcoming to other member states where they faced different challenges. We would not see them wanting, either. If we are to be left to our own devices and on our own in this, it is less than desirable. A strong argument should be made for greater supports from the European Union.

We have had extraordinary solidarity from other EU member states and from the EU institutions. That continues, as lately as yesterday, from President Juncker and the Luxembourg Prime Minister. Virtually every EU leader who speaks on Brexit talks about Ireland and the need for solidarity. In a no-deal scenario, I expect there will be solidarity too. We know that in the context of funding, particularly around agriculture, there will be a financial package of support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Commissioner Hogan has outlined that, although not the detail of it - I accept that. We also know that there is funding available for people who may be losing employment as a result of the shock of a no-deal Brexit. Along with that, we know we are going to have to access a lot of financial resources ourselves. We are designing a budget accordingly. As the Taoiseach said earlier, we would rather be borrowing money to keep people in employment than doing so to pay for social welfare because people have lost their jobs. We want to focus the support schemes on keeping businesses going and keeping people in employment as best we can as we get through the disruption that will undoubtedly happen after a no-deal Brexit.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	219	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is something in which I have big personal interest. Promises made during the election campaign in Israel, including threats to annex lands in the West Bank, are irresponsible and have a damaging impact on the prospects for a peace agreement and an end to the conflict in that region. Unhelpful election rhetoric is not unique to Israel, and Ireland and the EU will ultimately judge the next Israeli Government by its actions. However, such words are not without consequence, since they send dangerous messages and contribute to a climate of fear and insecurity among Palestinians. Annexation of territory by force is illegal under international law, including the UN Charter. Any unilateral annexation by Israel of occupied territory would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or the international community more generally. The position of Ireland and the EU is clear. We will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties involved. It has long been proposed that a future peace agreement may involve some agreed mutual border adjustments, but such changes can only be by mutual agreement.  With regard to Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks last week about the Jordan Valley, I would not usually comment on what is said in the course of an election campaign. However, due to the gravity of the issue, I felt it was important to make my views known. I also directed my officials to speak to the Israeli ambassador and to request that he convey Ireland’s position directly to his authorities. In fact, we called him into the Department and our Secretary General spoke directly to him. The EU position has also been reaffirmed publicly following Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments. As set out in numerous Foreign Affairs Council conclusions, the EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties. The settlement policy, including in east Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. Its continuation undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace.

The people of Israel are voting in a general election today following the collapse of the coalition supporting the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu. Recent years have seen a worsening of the situation in Israel and in Palestine.Arabs make up 20% of Israel's population but, with the support of right-wing and religious parties, Prime Minister Netanyahu passed the nationality Act, which prioritises Jewish citizens over Arabs and others living in Israel. The Arabic language was downgraded from an official language of Israel to one merely having status. Last week, Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that, if re-elected, Israel would annex the Jordan Valley, which is effectively one third of the West Bank. Just yesterday, he claimed that he could annex more of the West Bank with support from the United States. This is appalling and a dramatic worsening of the situation. We may say that these things happen during a general election but they are appallingly worrying. Prime Minister Netanyahu does not just make idle threats; it is my information that the day after he made the initial statement, teams were sent in to demolish Palestinian olive groves and some people's homes. I am also informed that businesses were demolished. I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste has acted. Will he set out to the House exactly what message he gave to the Israeli ambassador and what response the ambassador gave in justification for this threat, which the Tánaiste acknowledged is contrary to international law?

Others have also commented, although not enough people commented directly on the threat. The EU issued an appropriate collective statement of concern. I asked the Secretary General of my Department to invite in the Israeli ambassador, who is someone for whom I have a lot of time as he is a good person, in order to express our concern at the statement. I said we would regard it as an illegal act if the next Israeli Government were to proceed along the lines the Prime Minister has suggested. It is something that Ireland and the vast majority of the international community would condemn outright and would simply not accept. I look forward to being in New York next week to reinforce some of those messages. I will be at the UN General Assembly week where there will be many world leaders and I will meet many counterparts, including a number of EU and Arab counterparts, to discuss the Middle East peace process. Let us wait and see how the situation unfolds in the aftermath of the elections, but it is regrettable that a Prime Minister has chosen to raise the tension on such a sensitive issue in an effort to get votes. I suspect that the response and reaction among Palestinian communities are of real fear and uncertainty. My position is very clear; Ireland wants to be a friend of the Palestinians and also wants to be a friend of Israel. We want a peace agreement that can work, but we will not support illegal annexation under any circumstances.

I might be wrong but I think there is a dinner on Sunday evening specifically for EU foreign ministers to discuss the Middle East peace process. That is not unusual, as we had something similar last year during the week of the UN General Assembly. There will be a real opportunity to discuss these issues directly. As Deputy Howlin might know, Ireland has tried to give leadership within the EU to build consensus around supporting new peace initiatives. We want to be able to support a new US peace initiative for the Middle East, but it must be based on a two-state solution that is fair to both sides. I also hope to have meetings with the US side in that regard in New York. What was Deputy Howlin's second question?

I wish to ask the Tánaiste the status of efforts regarding the landbridge. In particular, in the context of a no-deal scenario, what is the plan to try to alleviate the pressures that will inevitably come from that?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	227	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 48 together. Upon leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will accede to the common transit convention, CTC. Under the convention, goods moving from Ireland to another member state via the UK, or vice versa, will move under the customs internal transit procedure. Once European Union goods are moving under the customs transit procedure from one member state to another through a third country, which essentially would be the UK, no duties or taxes will be applicable. Since December 2018, considerable progress has been made in clarifying the application of EU rules and an agreed understanding has been reached on the continued use of the landbridge under the internal transit procedure to ensure that Irish and EU operators can continue to use the landbridge in an effective and efficient way. Work continues at a technical level to provide absolute clarity on the application of certain EU rules and procedures with regard to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls on animals and products of animal origin. In addition, the necessary infrastructure has been put in place in Dublin and Rosslare ports to enable operators to open and close the transit procedure. The UK will also need to facilitate an office of transit in its ports. To this end, our officials in London and Cardiff met again recently with the port in Dover and will visit Holyhead and Folkestone shortly. However, in a no-deal scenario, it is anticipated that the landbridge, at least in the initial period, would be subject to significant delays and congestion. The Dover to Calais crossing has been identified as a particular bottleneck. It is also the case that the use of the landbridge after Brexit will not replicate the status quo for operators and will depend on traders being compliant with the new requirements under the CTC and also being in line with EU requirements. It is vital that businesses act now to ensure that they understand the necessary paperwork in respect of issues such as customs formalities and putting financial guarantees in place and that, where relevant, they are aware of SPS procedures. Targeted information campaigns are under way to ensure that operators are aware of the steps they must take and the supports available to them. In fairness to the UK, it has tried to facilitate this by signing up to the convention. In simple terms, the way this will work is that if a container leaving Dublin is sealed in Dublin, the seal will not need to be opened as it crosses the landbridge and the container can re-enter the Single Market. This will mean using the landbridge in the most seamless way we can make it. There are ways we can do that for food products too but a great deal of extra paperwork will be needed to ensure it runs smoothly.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	228	The Tánaiste's last point about the extra paperwork is something I intended to raise with him. Yesterday, I met representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association. Small hauliers have significant concerns. Citizens will probably be surprised to learn that the average size of a company fleet in Ireland is four trucks. The bigger hauliers will have the capacity to get their paperwork ready. They know what they need to do. However, significant disruption could arise because small hauliers will arrive at ports without having their paperwork ready and may be turned away.There is a body of work to be done because that will effectively mean empty spaces on our supermarket shelves for the weeks following the initial emergency situation. If we want to reach out to the small haulier, the level of engagement is not at the level it needs to be at, and it needs to be increased in the coming weeks. On the issue around the use of the landbridge, I know some work has been done around direct access so trucks can go straight from Ireland to mainland Europe and bypass the UK altogether. The difficulty is the difference in time. It currently takes 20 hours to go straight through the landbridge as opposed to 40 hours to go direct, according to figures from the Irish Maritime Development Office. I appreciate the Tánaiste said the status quo will not be maintained in any case and that the 20 hours is likely to increase. However, this poses a significant problem for perishable goods, in particular those that have a shorter shelf life, which may lose value if they have an extra day's travel time. We need a solution to that so we can help that industry. My final question concerns the issue of getting off at Calais. A number of months ago, we discussed the possibility of Irish trucks having a separate lane by which to exit to try to alleviate some of the pinch points in Calais and to try to claw back a bit of time. Will the Tánaiste update the House as to whether progress has been made in that regard?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	229	On the last question, the French have been unbelievably helpful on this issue. They have committed to ensuring there is a separate lane in Calais for Irish trucks coming off ships that have come over from Dover. I do not expect the same facilitation on the UK side in Dover, where there may be very long queues, and I certainly do not expect that Irish trucks will be able to skip those queues. However, in terms of coming off the ships, Irish trucks and product coming from Ireland will be in a different category - they are essentially coming from the Single Market and going back into the Single Market, using the UK as a landbridge, as opposed to products coming from the UK, which will be product coming from a third country. There will be a separate lane for Irish trucks to allow them to move through the port in a much more streamlined and quicker way. I want to thank the French authorities for that facilitation. As I said, they have been hugely helpful. We would like to get the same facilitation in other European ports and we are talking to them about that to try to ensure Irish trucks are not treated as trucks coming from a third country. I believe we are making good progress on that. The Deputy mentioned empty shelves in shops. The information I have is that we are not going to have empty shelves in our supermarkets. We may need to change supply chains, we may need to change suppliers for certain products and some brands may be different in the future. However, retailers are confident that they will be able to continue to fill shelf space, even in a no-deal scenario. 
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	230	I welcome the fact the Tánaiste thinks there will be no empty shelf space. There is concern because when we had bad weather, trucks were not able to travel for a day or two and we did have empty shelves. I am anticipating that if the worst does happen, the calamity around the ports might impact on supply chains, even for a short period, although perhaps that will not happen. I also want to share in thanking France for being such a good neighbour and a decent member state in helping us on that front. I certainly think it wise and prudent to pursue a similar arrangement with other ports on mainland Europe to facilitate Irish trucks. The Dover situation leaves us in a very precarious position. I imagine that not only will we not get the same treatment we are going to get in Calais, but the requirements on our paperwork will be quite stringent, and I have no doubt that Irish trucks will be turned away in that immediate period. That leaves us in a very tricky situation. I reiterate the point that the small hauliers are just not ready. There is a significant body of work to be done. If they are not ready and they are caught with no paperwork and stopped at the ports, that will impact on every citizen in the country in ways we probably do not even know at this time. What those hauliers are saying is that because they are operating on such a tight margin, they are very concerned just to stay in business in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

We want to work with them. My message to all hauliers it is that they need to prepare for a very different trade environment and that we are going to help them to do that. We can give them advice and financial support. We want to make sure that the big and small operators are ready by the end of October, like the SMEs and other sectors, some of which may not be ready yet, and we are also trying to reach out to them. Both advice and support are now available and they are easily accessible. I appeal to hauliers, big and small, to make sure they are as ready as they need to be.

We will continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress, both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens and also in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented to regularise their status. The Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also worked closely on these issues with my Department and he has done a really good job. Since taking office, I have continuously raised immigration issues in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders. In February, I visited the US for a series of engagements with the US Administration and congressional leaders, during which I raised these issues. In April, I was delighted to have the opportunity to discuss these with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and her congressional delegation when they visited Ireland. The Taoiseach has also raised immigration issues during his high-level engagements with the US, including during the visit of President Trump earlier in the summer, and the issue was also raised with Vice President Pence during his visit earlier this month. These engagements have already borne fruit. I was pleased to note that the E3 Bill, which if passed would offer new opportunities for Irish citizens to live and work in the US, was reintroduced into the US Congress earlier in the summer. Much work still needs to be done for this Bill to become law and our embassy in Washington D.C. is focusing its efforts on securing the passage of the Bill. The issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a high priority for the Government and Irish officials across the US continue to engage and advocate on behalf of this vulnerable community. My Department works alongside the Irish immigration centres across the US. I want to recognise the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, who has put an enormous amount of time and work into supporting many of the Irish communities across the US, many of them very vulnerable. In 2018, over €3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish centres. In short, we continue to prioritise this issue. We have made some progress in regard to the E3 Bill but there is still work to do.

We are all aware this is a long-running issue and there has not been any significant progress. We saw during the summer that a number of raids were carried out in the United States, which terrified Irish communities. An Irish man, Keith Byrne, was at the centre of one of those raids, which showed the vulnerability of Irish people living in the United States without documentation. It has to be a priority to keep this at the top of the agenda, which is why I am raising it here on behalf of Fianna Fáil. There needs to be a legal pathway to regularise the status of Irish people living there without documentation. We also need to step up our engagement in the United States with organisations that support the Irish across the states. The Tánaiste mentioned that the Taoiseach has raised this with President Trump and that the Tánaiste himself raised it with Vice President Pence, whom he met at Shannon Airport. Can he tell us exactly what the Vice President said or what indications he gave? When he was here, he made a big play in regard to his own Irish heritage.

What we were looking for, and what we had lobbied to try to achieve, was a system such that Ireland could potentially use the unused Australian visas the following year in order that there would be no question of our taking Australian visas, which would be reallocated to applicants from Ireland. The White House and the President's team have been hugely supportive in trying to get this legislation through. That goes right to the top, from my understanding, and we appreciate that. The Bill almost went through; one Senator prevented its passing. There are now efforts to try to ensure that it becomes law the second time around. That would open up for the first time in many years a new vehicle to facilitate young and not-so-young Irish people who want to go to work in the US under that structured scheme. It would be reciprocal because we would also facilitate US citizens coming here to work. We have made a great deal of progress in this area. We have a lot of support, not only from the President and the White House but also from Democrats. That is why the Bill was almost passed a few months ago. We will continue to work with friends and partners in Congress to get it passed.

What I am focusing on are the undocumented Irish in the United States. Where do matters stand in the context of finding a pathway, a glimmer of hope or a light at the end of the tunnel in order to regularise their status in the United States? I refer to the case of Keith Byrne, which came to light during the summer. The E3 visa, as the Tánaiste has rightly pointed out, will create a new pathway for people here to go to the United States. He knows the point I am making. I am asking about the people who are over there living in the shadows.

I spoke to his family at the time and we did what we could to help him. There are many other Keith Byrnes who have made the US their home, have family and children and good jobs and are contributing as good citizens in the US. We need to help them and we are trying. The truth, though, as the Deputy will know, is that immigration and immigration reform are about the most controversial thing on Capitol Hill. There are approximately 11 million undocumented people in the US, from many countries, including Ireland. We are trying to find ways in which we can help our people as best we can. It is also important, however, to be frank that when we try to do so, our efforts get caught up in solutions for many other communities. This is why we tried to pursue the E3 approach in the way we did to try to make some progress on visa access. We will continue to look for avenues. Our embassy is constantly looking for ways to allow us to advocate for the undocumented.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	240	I am deeply troubled by the escalation of violence in Libya in recent months, which we have spoken about in this House on a number of occasions, particularly the ongoing fighting around Tripoli, which is endangering thousands of civilians and putting already vulnerable migrants and refugees in Libya at further risk. The EU has called on all parties to implement immediately a ceasefire and to engage with the UN to ensure a full cessation of hostilities. I participated in the May meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, at which UN Special Representative Salamé briefed us on the situation and the council reiterated the EU's support for the UN-led peace process. Human rights abuses against migrants and refugees in Libya, particularly in detention centres, are a matter of grave concern. The Libyan Government bears primary responsibility and must manage migration in full compliance with international law, although we are aware that the Government does not have full control over many areas of Libyan territory. The EU is maintaining political pressure on the Libyan authorities to end the system of detention centres and is working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration to ensure that other options exist to protect and assist refugees and migrants. The EU High Representative highlighted the priority the EU attaches to this issue when she met the Libyan Prime Minister in May 2019. Through co-operation with the UN and the African Union, the EU has also helped more than 45,000 people stranded in Libya to return voluntarily to their countries of origin and has evacuated close to 4,000 people in need of international protection. Since many more people remain at risk, the EU will continue to work with its partners to relocate them to safe places. Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans, and migrants and refugees in Libya, will require restoration of political stability. Ireland and the EU will maintain pressure on all parties to work towards a negotiated solution to the conflict; ensure access for humanitarian organisations, which is hugely important in order that we can get accurate testimony to what is happening; and, ultimately, to put an end to the system of detention in Libya. I am, however, not unrealistic about the scale of the challenge we face and the timelines to which we are working.

There are two related issues, namely, the forced returns, which the Tánaiste mentioned, and the situation in the Mediterranean. Whether detention centre, forced return or the Mediterranean, there is real psychological and physical trauma to all those involved. Some NGOs took great heart from the Minister's words recently, when he wrote on Twitter:Migrants stranded in Med need a much more coordinated + collective response from the EU. Ad hoc arrangements on a case by case basis is not sustainable or humane. EU is better than this!How can the Tánaiste address these issues at EU level? There will be a summit on migration in Valletta, Malta, next week. Will the Government be represented there? If not, why?

I have been quite critical of the EU in terms of our inability to be able to agree collectively an approach not just on migration generally but on the need for humanitarian assistance and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean. I know there is a concern about creating pull factors and so on. There is some legitimacy to that concern, but it is not morally acceptable for the European Union not to put resources into ensuring that people do not drown in the Mediterranean. I was Minister for Defence when we decided to send naval vessels to the Mediterranean, effectively on a humanitarian mission, working in partnership with Italy. I think our ships took about 14,000 people out of the sea. The idea that we would knowingly allow people to drown in the Mediterranean and not have an agreed capacity to respond to that in a more humane way than is currently the case is not acceptable to me, and I have said that on a number of occasions to my Foreign Affairs Council colleagues. That said, the politics of this is really difficult. I hope we will be able to make more progress on this in the context of the new Italian Government, which may, I hope, take a more supportive position on the plight of refugees.

Under the previous Interior Minister, there could be fines of up to €1 million, captains could be arrested and vessels could be impounded. A little progress is being made. The Tánaiste did not indicate whether Ireland will be represented in Valletta.Whether we are or not, some calls need to be made on this. I support some NGOs such as Médecins sans Frontières, MSF, with regard to a sustainable and predictable disembarkation system that ensures the survivors' well-being. There needs to be an end to the current system of these forced returns to Libya. People are fleeing Libya, being caught and then forced back into dreadful conditions there. We need a more proactive and sufficient European search and rescue capacity. I know what the Italian ministers are trying to do. France and Germany have reportedly given the green light to the new system which would put an end to case-by-case negotiations. Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Spain are also in agreement. There is no mention of Ireland with regard to that. Is Ireland involved? If we are not going to the Valletta meeting, why not?

We said that we would play our part in burden sharing so that we would not have this case-by-case series of phone calls every time there is an NGO or state vessel that has migrants on board, in the hope that different countries will take ten, 20 or 30 refugees here or there. We have been doing that for the last year, quietly taking our share and trying to support people in a humane way. We would like to have a system that a large number of the member states of the EU would buy into, otherwise we are unfairly asking certain countries to take too much of the burden. This was the problem for Italy in the first place, which is why politics responded by electing someone who was advocating for a hardline message on migration. We need to help Italy. We also need to ensure that the burden and responsibility are shared. With regard to our attendance at the Valletta meeting, I am not sure because I will be in New York next week, as will the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon. I will check whether we are sending somebody. I have a very good relationship with my counterpart in Malta. I will check whether we are sending somebody to the Valletta meeting.

I do not think anything is inevitable. We do not have the outcome of the election yet so I do not think we should make predictions. I made a statement on this matter in an earlier reply, as the Deputy acknowledged. I underline again that Ireland and the EU will closely monitor the actions of the next Israeli Government in the context of these recent announcements. Israelis are voting in an election today but it may be some weeks until a government is formed. I have already said that Ireland and the EU stand by the internationally agreed parameters for a negotiated peace agreement and continue to urge the Israeli Government to uphold its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment of a civilian population. Ireland will continue to convey its concerns on related developments on the ground in all relevant international fora as well as directly with the Israeli authorities. Ireland has consistently taken action at both EU and UN level to ensure that the international community retains a focus on the Israel-Palestine issue. Our position on settlement expansion, demolition of Palestinian homes and other buildings and forced removal of Palestinians from their homes is extremely clear and I have made it clear in this House many times. All actions which compromise the viability of a future Palestinian state are extremely dangerous. Such unilateral actions further diminish the prospects of successful negotiations and an end to conflict, something which I firmly believe is in the best interests of Israelis as well as Palestinians. With the prospects for peace continuing to deteriorate, EU foreign ministers have discussed the peace process on numerous occasions over the last year, most recently at an informal meeting in Helsinki on 29 and 30 August. We will remain vigilant about how the situation develops. The situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory will remain high on my agenda. I am committed to doing everything I can to make a positive contribution to support credible efforts to resume negotiations to advance the Middle East peace process.

I would argue that it is not an election ploy or an off-the-cuff remark. It has been the central policy and goal of the Israeli state since its foundation. It is the inevitable logic of the settler state. This week alone has not been unusual or strange. It has been just another episode in a litany of dispossessions, illegal settlements, routine abuse and the dehumanisation of the Palestinian people. In Beit Jala, a restaurant owned by a Christian Palestinian family was bulldozed by the Israeli military. Some 850 acres were confiscated and then immediately moved onto by illegal settlers. It is a conquest and an ongoing, tortuous genocide of the Palestinian people. I ask the Tánaiste and the Government to commit to action. For example, will the Government cease blocking Senator Frances Black's Bill on the Israeli illegal settlement goods? Will the Tánaiste call in the Israeli ambassador and indicate that, should these settlements and the annexation of the West Bank continue, he will be expelled? The Tánaiste refers to the ambassador as a nice man and somebody he gets on well with. He should call the ambassador in and tell him that he wants to continue to get on well but that we will not tolerate this illegal activity by the Israeli state. It is not new but continuous. It is not an election ploy but a strategic goal of the Israeli state.

Israeli policy with regard to the West Bank has changed at times. We have been very close to comprehensive peace agreements on a number of occasions where Israeli politics has sought a fair solution based on a two-state solution for both Israelis and Palestinians. The Deputy should not categorise this as a policy that has been the same for a long period. That is not the case. We will not support Senator Frances Black's Bill because we do not believe it is legal. My position on that is clear. We do not believe it is sound legislation. We do not believe it can be implemented or that it is legally sound. I regard my relationship with the Israeli Embassy as important because we want to try to influence politics in Israel and we care about the Middle East peace process, Israel's future and the future for Palestinians. We want a Palestinian state that is functioning and controlled by Palestinians in the future. We will continue to advocate for a two-state solution and fair peace process for both sides.

These developments, along with the demolitions and the expansion of the illegal settlements, are a flagrant abuse of international law. It is hard to believe that anyone in authority, either in Israel or anyone who purports to speak with authority on its behalf, is genuine about achieving a peace process that will work and a two-state solution. Does the Tánaiste believe anybody in authority or anybody who speaks on behalf of Israel when he meets them? The Tánaiste recently met Vice President Pence. Did he raise this specific issue with the Vice President? What did the Vice President say?

Over the past two years, we have seen a significant deterioration in the relationship between Israeli and Palestinian political leaders. We have also seen a significant deterioration in the relationship between Palestinians and the US.That is regrettable because instead of trying to make progress towards peace, in many ways we have been moving in the opposite direction. I have spoken out about that quite a lot and I have attracted some attention and at times, some criticism, as has Deputy Niall Collins. However, I will continue to speak out on this issue because Irish people feel strongly about it. There is a sense of injustice here. My view and that of the Government is that we should be a strong advocate for a fair outcome that is good for Israel and respects its legitimate concerns, particularly around security, while also demanding the fair treatment of the Palestinians in the context of any negotiation and a final settlement.

The Tánaiste just said that he regards the Bill introduced by Senator Frances Black as illegal. I assume he also regards the settlements as illegal. The Government has the opportunity to amend Senator's Black's Bill if it allows it to proceed but it seems intent on stopping the progress of any Bills from the Opposition. The Tánaiste and this Government would rather stand here, wring their hands and say nice words than do something about the illegal settlements, and the torture and systemic erosion of the rights of the Palestinian people. The Tánaiste cannot say that one side is equal to the other; he cannot claim that the concerns of the Israelis are equal to the rights of the Palestinians in the face of the absolute lack of fairness and equality and the murder and genocide being perpetrated by the Israelis in Palestine. It is interesting to note that the Tánaiste did not have time to raise this issue with Vice President Pence and I assume that the Taoiseach did not have time to raise it with President Trump when he visited County Clare recently. The Government never seems to have the time or the bottle to challenge the US regime or the Israeli ambassador on the utterly illegal genocide that is not only continuing but escalating, as can be seen by the whole world. The Tánaiste said that the Irish people are very concerned and, indeed, we are, but we are sick of the hand wringing by the Tánaiste and his Government. They must take some decisive action, as they have done in the past with other states when they believed that they had breached international law.

I have been engaged on this issue in a serious way for two years now. In my first 12 months in office, I visited Palestine and Israel on three separate occasions. I have spoken to Mr. Jared Kushner and Mr. Jason Greenblatt about their approach to this issue on multiple occasions. I have met the previous and current Israeli ambassadors who understand the Irish position only too well. My interest here is in an outcome, not in playing politics with an issue or criticising others for certain approaches. My interest here is the Palestinian and the Israeli people, in terms of trying to move towards a peace process that can deliver a settlement that will save lives and allow a dispute that has been going on for decades to be resolved once and for all. We will continue with that approach.

In terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, what resources are available to our diplomats and the secretariat in our embassy in London and in the consulates general in Cardiff and Edinburgh, given that our relationship with the UK may change so drastically in just a few weeks' time?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	261	I thank the Deputy for what is a fair question. Managing Brexit negotiations and preparation has been a key priority of the work of my Department in recent years, both at headquarters and overseas, including in the UK, for obvious reasons. Since 2016, additional staff have been assigned to the key divisions at headquarters with responsibility for Brexit matters, including the EU division and the Ireland, UK, Americas, IUKA division. Additional posts have also been established at our embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris and the permanent representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels. Our embassy in London remains our largest bilateral embassy. The additional staff assigned to the mission since the Brexit vote reflects the priority of our relationship with the UK. The resources will remain under close review and will be adjusted as required. Closer partnerships with the devolved administrations in Cardiff and Edinburgh remain strategically important. Our consul general in Edinburgh engages closely with the Scottish Government to deepen existing strong political, economic, community and cultural ties. The reopening of our consulate general in Cardiff earlier this year will ensure Wales-Ireland relations deepen in the coming years, particularly in political and economic terms. The wider Team Ireland enjoys a significant footprint in Britain with our trade, tourism and investment agencies making a positive impact. The Global Ireland initiative supports Government efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism as we prepare for the impact of Brexit. It will ensure Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its position in a post-Brexit EU, while helping to secure our relationship with the UK and its constituent parts. The strategy includes a commitment to open a new consulate in a third location in Britain. During the visit by the Taoiseach to Manchester in June for the British-Irish Council, he reiterated the Government’s commitment to opening an additional consulate in another UK location post-2019. We have not made a final decision on the location yet but Deputies could make a reasonable guess as to the priority cities. In response to rising demand for passports, my Department has significantly strengthened the capacity of the passport office by recruiting approximately 300 additional staff. 
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
 This includes over 200 temporary clerical officers assigned to the processing of applications. These measures remain under review. The Department will allocate additional staff resources as necessary to further augment our level of Brexit-related supports across Government and across our network overseas.

We will have staff on the ground at ports to assist the movement of goods through the landbridge, if necessary. The Tánaiste referred to Team Ireland which comprises bodies such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Tourism Ireland. We have seen a decline in British tourist numbers since the Brexit storm first blew up. In that context, does the Tánaiste believe that we have enough feet on the ground? According to its website, the London embassy only has around 20 key officials who must now deal with what is a massive challenge. The Tánaiste also mentioned consular offices in Cardiff and Edinburgh, which also have a relatively small number of staff. Is this something that will feature in the budget in October? Will additional resources be provided to our diplomatic staff and all of the allied staff in Team Ireland?

We have a brilliant team in London and we need it because the relationship between Britain and Ireland is under some strain at the moment because of the challenges of Brexit. We have a really good team in London, led by our ambassador, and they are doing a good job but if they need more people, we will appoint more. That is the truth of it. The relationship that we have with the UK is our most important relationship. That is why our consulate in Cardiff has reopened and why we will be opening another consulate in an English city to complement what we are doing in London and Edinburgh. We are constantly reviewing whether we need to add more people, just like we have done in Paris and Berlin. In Berlin, for example, we have added an arts officer because we believe there is a lot of work to do in terms of building connections with Germany around the arts, literature, music and so on. We are working with other Government Departments to make sure that our teams are appropriate for the challenges we face. Clearly, the biggest challenge we face at the moment is Brexit and trying to find a way forward through the diplomatic channels that we have in London, in particular, is a big priority for us.

I commend the group. Deputy Ferris knows those concerned as well as I do. They are ordinary, decent, hard-working people from Tralee and all around County Kerry who have supported the hospital under the umbrella of the group. They have done Trojan work and picked up the slack of the current and previous Governments, which have let them down. They have raised millions of euro for much-needed equipment for our hospital in County Kerry. One item of equipment for which the group provided funding was a DEXA scanner. The scanner was staffed for a while but unfortunately it now lies idle. Patients now have to travel to Cork or pay privately to have their scans carried out privately in Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee. We are very grateful the latter hospital is in the county also. It provides an excellent service. Why, however, is a vital piece of medical equipment lying idle? The Department of Health has so many Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, much as we may like him, that one would nearly want a stick to wave at all of them. With the mismanagement of taxpayers' money, we cannot staff the vital piece of machinery, which was paid for through fundraising by Friends of University Hospital Kerry. It has been lying idle for four years. There has been inaction by the current and previous Ministers and the HSE. It is disgraceful and disrespectful to the people of Kerry and the staff of the hospital, who would gladly man the equipment if they were allowed to do so.

A DEXA scanner measures bone density. I was looking at some of the statistics on bone density and the importance of a DEXA scanner, particularly in respect of fractures. The number of fractures, particularly among middle-aged women, exceeds the number of all other conditions. Women are twice as likely to have a fracture as a heart attack, five times more likely to have one than cancer, and eight times more likely to have one than a stroke. The value of the scanner to University Hospital Kerry is immeasurable. I have data on the years prior to the four years in which the machine was not in operation. Some 202 people went through the scanner in the first year of operation and 290 people in its last year of operation. I am told 800 people are waiting to be scanned by the scanner. As stated by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, Friends of University Hospital Kerry raised a considerable amount of money. It bought the scanner for the hospital and installed it. The Department of Health needs to make a radiologist available so the 800-plus patients can get the scans they need in order for them to have their rights and entitlements. Having to go to Cork or receive private care is not an excuse. It should not be the case. I have spoken to the Kerry general manager on this issue. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae spoke to him also. We raised the necessity of the scanner at meetings we attended and, on each occasion, we were told that there are not the personnel to run it because the funding has not been made available. I urge the Minister of State to give this immediate consideration.

I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I welcome all the Deputies back after the summer recess. Raising this issue gives me an opportunity to provide an update to the House on the DEXA scanner at University Hospital Kerry. I agree with my colleagues and acknowledge the tremendous efforts of Friends of University Hospital Kerry, which has been instrumental in encouraging charitable contributions from the community towards the work of the hospital. I thank it most sincerely for the provision of the scanner in 2015 to meet a growing patient need. The HSE has advised that, despite numerous national and international recruitment drives, University Hospital Kerry has been unable to recruit a full complement of radiographers to provide DEXA scanning services. However, I understand that University Hospital Kerry is currently interviewing for basic and senior radiographers and the hospital hopes to appoint staff within the coming weeks, following which the hospital may be in a position to consider re-establishing the service. The hospital is also seeking to identify suitably qualified staff, other than radiographers, to undertake training in the operation of the DEXA scanner. Furthermore, other options including potential outsourcing will be considered. It is important to note that the challenges in the recruitment and retention of radiographers are not specific to University Hospital Kerry but are also reflected right across the country. Following a decision in 2016 to conduct a national review, approval was obtained in September 2017 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to appoint an independent chair to conduct the review. The terms of reference for the review include a wide range of issues for examination, including retention and recruitment. It is important to note that this review will not examine issues related to pay that are being addressed by the Public Service Pay Commission. A series of site visits concluded in early 2018. The purpose of these visits was to gain a greater understanding of the day-to-day issues that are a cause of concern for the radiographers. It is expected that a draft report containing recommendations will be agreed by the review group in the near future. It is important to note that the radiographers comprise one of the healthcare professional groups being examined under module 2, phase 2, of the work being undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission. This group was identified for further examination as evidence of recruitment and-or retention difficulties was found to exist during the work undertaken as part of the commission’s work for its first report. The report concerning module 2, phase 2, is due to be published in the coming weeks.

Some 800 patients are waiting, however. If I believed the response was going to be factual, that the scanner would be up and running in the next couple of weeks and that patients would not have to wait, go to Cork or pay for a scan in Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee, I would very warmly welcome it. If the machine can meet its full potential and be put to its full use, it would be most welcome. I wish to advise the Minister of State of one thing. In a common, ordinary and sensible way, could I ask him to take a leaf out of the book I describe? He should note the number of people I take to Belfast regularly to have cataracts removed from their eyes. Surgeons come in on a Sunday to carry out scheduled operations. They go through a bus-load at a time. Why can we not do this here in the Republic? Why can we not operate our hospitals in this way and use the machinery in place to reduce waiting lists?

I am just looking at answers I received when I raised this matter in the past. The answers have been somewhat similar. They stated the hospital hoped to appoint staff within the coming weeks and that it might be in a position to reconsider the service. This is typical Civil Service-speak. There is no substance to it. The response is that the hospital is "seeking to identify suitably qualified staff". This has been ongoing for four years. I cannot understand how, in the past four years, the HSE and hospital were not able to identify and appoint suitable staff. There were 202 patients and 290 patients, respectively, scanned in the first two years of operation. The number on the waiting list has grown to over 800.I hope that what is in the Minister of State's reply comes to pass in the coming weeks, but I have heard it all before. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and other Kerry Deputies who have met with the hospital management in recent years are in a position to vouch for what I am saying.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	271	Of course, I fully understand the local frustrations of Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Ferris in respect of the 800 people to whom they refer and the fact that a DEXA scanner has been provided through the voluntary donations of the people of Kerry but cannot be used due to a shortage of the radiographers required to operate it. I understand their frustration and annoyance in that regard. The HSE advises that the hospital is engaging with Friends of University Hospital Kerry in respect of progress and that the hospital is extremely grateful for the tremendous fundraising work the foundation has carried out. I encourage the management of University Hospital Kerry to work quickly to progress local solutions to this issue and I look forward to the outcome of the national radiographer review and to any recommendations that will promote the recruitment and retention of radiographers in the Irish healthcare system. Of course, I will bring the concerns the Deputies have raised here today back to the Department, to the HSE, and to the Minister, Deputy Harris.

This is one of the cruellest cuts ever made to disability services. It relates to an allowance of €31.80 a week but it is not just a monetary cut. This allowance provides great encouragement to people to start courses. Not getting the €31.80 can actually stop people doing such courses. I cannot understand why the Minister of State would go ahead with these cuts. When I asked him in a parliamentary question what the money saved would be spent on, he said that it would be put into day care services, depending on priority. I cannot see what could be a higher priority than what the money is currently used for.

I hope that the Minister of State is in the House this evening to say that he is going to reverse it. It is a punitive measure which affects those who do not themselves have a strong voice. I fail to understand the economic prerogative behind this cut. People in this sector are in what is called a rehabilitative phase, which is designed to assist progression. For the sake of €31.80 per person, it seems miserly and mean to make cuts affecting people in this category. I hope that the Minister of State will reverse this decision because none of us on this side of the House understands why it was made in the first instance.

This means that people with disabilities will not get the allowance of €31.80 a week they received while on the programme. In the Minister of State's reply to me he said that 2,300 people receive the allowance. That means the HSE is spending €3.6 million on the scheme every year. He also said that 400 new people would lose out this year. That means the HSE will save approximately €220,000 this year. That is not a lot when one considers the size of the HSE's annual budget. The people who get the allowance really need it. It is vital for them. It can represent the difference between doing a rehabilitative training programme and not doing one. These programmes are about life skills. The allowance is about helping people with disabilities to avail of a service which allows them to learn independence. This allowance helps them to be independent, to make choices, and to begin to be full members of the community. They have a right to this and they deserve it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	276	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to explain the situation and to dispel many of the myths that appeared over the summer, particularly in the national media. It gives me the opportunity to outline the position in respect of the rehabilitative training, RT, bonus payment. The Government's priority is to provide access to high quality day services to as many people with disabilities as possible. The HSE currently funds day services for more than 27,000 people with disabilities. These services include rehabilitative training programmes. Placements in day services are invaluable as they provide people with disabilities with a range of supports to allow them to make the type of choices available to other adults, enabling them to live independent lives of their choosing. The HSE's New Directions policy seeks to reconfigure and personalise HSE-funded adult day services and offers a flexible and individualised set of supports to enable each person to live a life of his or her choosing in accordance with his or her own wishes and needs. Rehabilitative training programmes are designed to equip participants with basic personal, social and work-related skills. Approximately 2,300 people attend rehabilitative training programmes and, since the start of September, approximately 400 school leavers have commenced RT programmes. The RT bonus payment is currently paid at a rate of €31.80 per week to attendees of these rehabilitative training programmes, who can attend for a period of up to four years. The RT bonus was introduced in 2001, aligned with a similar FÁS training bonus that later became the SOLAS vocational training programme payment. It is important to note that this payment was reduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2012. Over the next four years, from September 2019, the RT bonus will cease to apply to new attendees, rather, the money that would have been spent on the bonus, estimated at approximately €3.7 million over four years, will be redirected to address unmet need in day service provision for people with disabilities. The redirected funding, which I have asked the director general of the HSE to ring-fence, will create approximately - wait for it - 148 additional full day placements or 370 additional enhanced day places nationally for those with a reduced service or no service, based on priority need. These new day services will be of great support to those with a disability and their families. Each community healthcare organisation, CHO, will have the flexibility to redirect its own savings to address local service requirements and the HSE has been asked to report regularly to the Department of Health on the additional placements realised. I emphasise that current participants in rehabilitative training programmes will not be affected and that their payments will continue until they complete their four-year programme. It is important to note that while the majority of attendees of HSE day services qualify for disability allowance, which is paid at a rate of €203 per week and also qualifies them for a free travel pass, the additional RT bonus payment is only payable to attendees of rehabilitative training programmes. This decision will maximise the use of finite resources and, crucially, will ensure that all attendees of HSE-funded day services have the same level of support.

During the summer, I had the pleasure of visiting the training unit in Bantry. I met many of the students there and they spoke very eloquently about what the course meant to them. It helps their confidence and gives them self-belief. Many of them said that without the €31.80 they simply could not attend. The Minister of State points out that it is only new students who will not get the allowance. That is also very cruel. In any one classroom, there will be some people who get the allowance and some people who do not. Only this morning I heard the story of one lad who does not get the allowance going to the cinema with his friends from the course, all of whom do get the allowance. He did not have the price of admission but fair play to the other lads, they clubbed together to give him the money to get in. That is a result of the Minister of State's actions. It is cruel to cut the allowance and it is cruel that some get it while others do not.

That is clear and unambiguous.I take little comfort from his reply to the effect that each CHO within the HSE's regions would have flexibility to redirect its own savings to address local service requirements. All of us on this side of the House are used to dealing with the HSE at local level and we know that that money will go into the so-called black hole of Calcutta. It will not be redirected to the people who most need it. What the Minister of State is taking away from people is the modicum of independence for which they strive. The payment represents that independence, but it is being swiped from them and given to the CHOs. It is a disgraceful decision on his part and one that need not have been made. For the sake of ensuring equality within the system, everyone should have kept the right to retain the payment.

This was acknowledged by a former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, in 2012 after a previous attempt by the HSE to cut the allowance. The same arguments were put forward, but Ms Lynch refuted them. That was during a time when many painful spending cuts were being made. The allowance was deemed worthy of protection in light of its value to people with disabilities. The Government has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The policy is to empower people with disabilities to live independent lives. The payment in question is perhaps the clearest example of a direct payment empowering people with disabilities to live independently. I cannot think of another example which reflects that need as clearly. The decision goes against the policy and makes no sense. It saves very little money and deprives people with disabilities of the opportunity to be independent and live the lives they want. It hits a group of people who already find it more difficult to take part in society. They deserve better than this. I call on the Minister of State to put this decision on hold and review it. No one is fooled - it is a money-saving measure by the HSE at the expense of the most vulnerable. I ask that the Minister of State stand up for them.

The Government remains committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. The commitments outlined in the programme for Government are guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. I assure the House that the decision to phase out the rehab training bonus payment was not taken lightly and was only done when assurances were given that any money saved would be used to ensure that all HSE-funded day services were provided on an equitable basis. We have 26,000 people attending day services every day who do not get this bonus at all. Does Deputy Brendan Ryan want me to pay them as well? Of course-----

The Talbot Group recently purchased Oatfield House on the outskirts of Athboy, County Meath, to provide a residential home for adults with intellectual disabilities. Substantial works have been carried out on the property to bring it up to a HIQA-approved standard. However, what parents, carers and the local community want is for Oatfield House to provide respite services for adults with intellectual disabilities as opposed to a residential service. Like many public representatives in the area, I have been making representations to the Minister of State and the HSE. We have been advised that funding is not available in this year's budget to provide respite services at that location, but funding is not really an issue. Given that it has already been provided for a residential care facility at Oatfield House, it is more a question of out of which pot the money would come. The families of adults with intellectual disabilities in north-west Meath and the rest of the county are looking for a respite facility that will support the needs of more than 70 families. The figures speak for themselves. As a residential service, the facility can look after five to six families. As a respite service, it could look after 70 families. This is an opportunity for those in Meath with special needs and their families that should not be missed. The Minister of State has taken a deep and personal interest in this case. For many years, Meath has been near the bottom of the table in terms of respite services. There is effectively no respite option for families of over 18s with intellectual disabilities in my county. We must compliment the fantastic work done by the Special Hands Activity Group in County Meath. It has been leading the campaign to get respite services for people with intellectual disabilities in the county and further afield. It is acutely aware of the importance of respite care facilities and the lack of respite services in Meath and many other areas. Families in neighbouring counties, including Westmeath and Cavan, would also benefit from this service. We have a property that is ready and waiting to provide respite services. We cannot let this opportunity pass us. The house has been fully kitted out to a HIQA-approved standard and can provide the services in question to many people. If we let this opportunity pass, the Special Hands Activity Group and families all over Meath will be back to square one in terms of much-needed respite services. I wish to press the Minister of State on two important issues. First, there is a short timeframe in which to get funding for respite services at Oatfield House in Athboy. If the Talbot Group does not get an indication from the HSE by November that funding will be provided for respite services, the group will begin the process of opening the property as a normal residential care service. Second, if funding is approved, which I hope it will be, it must be ring-fenced for respite care at the property. We need this facility to offer respite to families for many years to come and to be able to give assurances regarding same.

It is important that we understand the position as regards the provision of funding for respite services for adults with intellectual disabilities in Athboy, County Meath. The Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service. We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives. This commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government and is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. Respite services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families. Respite care is crucial in helping to reduce family stress, preserve the family unit and provide stability. The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available. As part of its ongoing service provision, the HSE will this year provide 182,500 respite nights and 32,662 day respite sessions to families in need across the country. In 2018, there was a significant improvement in respite. An additional €8 million was provided to fund 12 new respite houses. That is one in each HSE CHO area, plus an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the high demand for respite from this area. These extra houses are providing additional respite for families that need it.All 12 houses are now fully open and operational. An extra €2 million was also provided to target alternative respite services. These are practical and important solutions and include summer camps and evening and Saturday clubs. There is €2 million again available to the HSE this year for the provision of similar activities in each CHO area. This alterative respite is benefiting hundreds of adults and children.  With reference to Oatfield House, Athboy, I am informed by the HSE Midlands Louth Meath disability services that a house was recently purchased by the Talbot Group and registered with HIQA for the provision of respite services to adults with disabilities. The decision to proceed with the purchase of this house was made independent of the HSE. Meath disability services do not currently have the available resources to fund a new respite service. While Midlands Louth Meath CHO sought funding to further develop the residential respite service in the county, as part of the Estimates process for 2019, funding was not available to proceed with same. However, I am informed that Midlands Louth Meath CHO will continue to seek additional funding for residential respite in Meath and this will be included in Estimates process for 2020. As Minister of State, I am pushing this issue. I am focusing on the provision of services such as respite, emergency residential services and quality day services.

He said the decision to proceed with the purchase of the house was made independent of the HSE. I view that as the Talbot Group taking the lead and the initiative by seeing that there was a requirement and then establishing the facility having recognised the need for it. Talbot Group has listened to the voices of people on the ground in Athboy. I know those families and I listen to them every week because my constituency office is half a mile down the road from this facility. The families are frustrated because they see a fully-equipped facility that could assist many families. If a change of attitude is not taken, it will only assist a small number of families. I refer to the final points made by the Minister of State, namely, that there will be an attempt to seek additional funding for this. The Minister of State has said he will try to assist with that. Can we get assurances that, if such funding was acquired, there would be a pathway to see this developed as a respite service? Could we give the Talbot Group some indicative assurances that the Minister of State would personally like to see that happen, notwithstanding that he has to go through the process of budgets and so on? Can he assure us, as Minister of State, that this is a type of care that he backs and that, if additional funding is attained, it can be ring-fenced and apportioned to establish this respite service? Can I get assurance from the Minister of State that he backs this concept and that, if additional funding was to come into his pathway, that this could be established as a respite service to look after those 70 families at Oatfield House in Athboy?

We must ensure that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise as it facilitates families to receive a break from caring, preserve the family unit and provide stability. I will, of course, do all in my power to assist to develop these services. I am well aware of the Talbot Group and agree with Deputy Cassells that it is an excellent service provider. I am aware of the group as a Minister of State and I know its staff, the high standards that it upholds and the confidence in which it is held by families. I must also be conscious of the necessity for it to be independent, away from the Minister. Respite services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families and are crucial to reducing family stress. Short breaks can provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circle and gain new experiences. The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and I agree with Deputy Cassells about that. The HSE and I will continue to work with all service providers to explore the various ways of responding to this in line with the available budgets. There are currently 18 residential respite beds available to adults and children in County Meath. I accept Deputy Cassells's reference to 70 families because that is also what I am hearing from people and families on the ground. As I said earlier, I am informed that the Midlands Louth Meath CHO will continue to seek additional funding for residential respite in Meath and this will be included in the Estimates process.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	303	I do not need to tell the Minister that climate action is an enormous challenge for our country and, indeed, our planet. Warnings of increasing global temperatures have been made by scientists over the past number of decades. We can see ourselves that the climate is changing and we have been challenged to rethink how society will function through the changes that we as individuals, communities, businesses and industries must make. I am from west Offaly, brought up in Belmont and Ferbane. Offaly is a county where energy generation has been a part of the fabric of life for decades since the establishment of Bord na Móna and the building of the ESB power stations across the county. One third of our landmass comprises peat so it is no surprise that peat harvesting for energy generation was focused there. Offaly experienced less emigration than many other counties in the 1950s due to the number of jobs available in Bord na Móna and the ESB. In parts of the midlands, small towns and villages grew rapidly when houses were built for Bord na Móna and ESB employees. The staff and their families contributed both economically and socially to their communities. As such, Bord na Móna has been an integral part of the commercial and social development of the midlands for decades, creating significant employment in the region. Employment peaked in Bord na Móna at 7,000 in the early 1980s and the company now provides approximately 1,500 direct jobs which in turn support at least another 1,800 indirect jobs. Consequently, Bord na Móna holds an iconic status in the midlands, particularly in my own county of Offaly, and is part of the social glue of many local communities.  The transition from peat harvesting in the midlands has been flagged for many years and it has been accepted by Bord na Móna and ESB workers that electricity generation would be peat free by 2027. The planned managed transition out of peat has been significantly impacted and complicated by the recent An Bord Pleanála decision to refuse planning for the west Offaly power station in Shannonbridge beyond the end of 2020. The application sought planning permission for the plant to co-fire peat and biomass until the end of 2027. The expectation was that, from early 2020, the plant would operate by gradually reducing the volumes of peat and increasing volumes of biomass so that, by the end of 2027, the station would be fuelled exclusively by biomass. This decision has huge implications for the workers, their families and communities. It has all the hallmarks of a potentially devastating blow to Offaly and the wider midlands area. This matter must be resolved for the protection of the workers and their families and a solution must urgently be found.  The Government and the EU institutions have all committed to a just transition for workers and it is an imperative that action is taken on this immediately. This will have significant implications for the wider economy and I repeat my call on the ESB and Bord na Móna to communicate in an open and transparent way with workers about this situation. Uncertainty and speculation cannot be allowed to reign and, to this end, I ask the Minister to consider meeting with the Bord na Móna group of unions. I understand that they have proposals on the work required to carry out the rehabilitation and restoration of former peat production areas. I will not go into the reasons for the An Bord Pleanála decision but suffice to say that I hope the ESB will seek leave to apply for a judicial review of the decision. Time is running out and is of the essence. There are huge concerns at local government level in Offaly as to the financial implications for Offaly County Council's rate base in the county. The rate base in recent years has remained static but it is of huge concern that, at present, the ESB's west Offaly power station and Bord na Móna's Edenderry power plant account for just over 25% of the county's rate base. This has the potential to leave a €4.5 million hole in the council's budget. Offaly has made efforts to increase its own revenues locally with the local county councillors making a decision yesterday to increase the local property tax which will mean that 78% of households will pay no more than €33 extra per annum, but cumulatively it will make a considerable difference locally. We are doing what we can at local level but Offaly and other midland counties require urgent action from the Government and our EU partners. We are being disproportionately impacted by the decarbonisation transition and will require financial assistance to allow Offaly make this transition.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	24292	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	304	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am aware of her concern, having met her and other Deputies during the summer. The climate action plan, which was launched in June, includes an increase in electricity generation from renewable sources from 30% to 70% by 2030. This includes replacing the use of peat and coal for electricity generation with onshore and offshore wind, as well as solar power. This will reduce our CO2 emissions intensity from electricity generation, which is currently above the EU average. The plan commits to early and complete phase-out of coal by 2025 and peat, as the Deputy stated, by 2028 for electricity generation. This is in line with the commitments under the Paris Agreement. The three electricity generating plants in the midlands - Edenderry, owned and operated by Bord na Móna, and Lough Ree and west Offaly, owned by the ESB - have been planning for some time to reduce and eliminate the use of peat at the plants. Bord na Móna currently co-fires with 30% biomass. Both the ESB plants have been granted support under REFIT 3 for co-firing with 30% biomass. The ESB is in the process of seeking planning permission to co-fire with biomass at Lough Ree. A recent decision by An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission for the west Offaly power station to co-fire and eventually run only on biomass. The ESB is evaluating this decision to see if a revised planning application can be submitted to achieve approval. A planning application for the Lough Ree power station to co-fire with biomass is currently with Longford County Council. As the Deputy indicated, Bord na Móna has been an integral part of the commercial and social development of the midlands for decades, creating significant employment in the region. In its strategy to exit peat, Bord na Móna envisages the development and scaling up of new business opportunities to ensure the future commercial viability of the company and enable it to continue its mandate as an employer in the midlands. It aims to develop a transition from peat or, as they say, from brown to green. The ESB is also fully committed to the process of decarbonisation. Following this decision, my Department and I are intensively assessing the options. lf an earlier exit from peat than planned is required, the Government is determined to ensure a just transition. I have met the board of Bord na Móna and its worker directors and the Oireachtas midlands representatives, the midlands regional transition team, the midlands regional enterprise strategy team and the regional skills fora team. I intend to meet shortly with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. There are several strands being explored to support a just transition, including Bord na Móna diversification, accelerated bog restoration by Bord na Móna, wider restoration of non-Bord na Móna bogs, an area-based retrofitting initiative and other special initiatives for regional development. I have secured the inclusion of the midlands in the Platform for Coal and Other Carbon Intensive Regions in Transition, which supports regions affected by climate. I met Commissioner Canete in Brussels and he confirmed in July that peat is being included and that the region would be included as part of that platform. Membership of the platform enables the midlands region to avail of the support of a dedicated country team, comprised of Commission experts, to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation. The team will also assist in identifying appropriate EU funding opportunities for the midlands. The meetings of the platform also enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas between carbon-intensive regions. A preliminary meeting of this team and officials from relevant Departments and other stakeholders is planned to take place in the middle of October. The Government is committed to delivering a whole-of-government approach in response to this and that a just and fair transition is provided to those affected. Following the final Government meeting before summer, An Taoiseach reassured the midlands that a just transition plan would be worked on to find alternative employment in the region. An interdepartmental group led by the Department of the Taoiseach has been established to develop a just transition plan for the midlands. This work cuts across a number of Departments, including my Department, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Employment and Innovation, Rural and Community Development and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I very much welcome some of the new information he provided on his intention to meet with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which will be very helpful, and also that the county team will come to Ireland in November. It is crucial that the local midlands regional transition team would be an important part of the discussions with that county team. I commend Offaly County Council, which has been proactive in the response to recent events and which has established a regional transition team, bringing together all the stakeholders in Offaly County Council - the elected representatives, the local enterprise office, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord na Móna, AIT and Offaly Local Development Company. That is a very good example of how everybody pulling together can be proactive in responding to it. The council is coming up with ideas and I sincerely hope there will be support for one of its aims, which is to explore ways the regional transition team can work with Bord na Móna to assess the viability of upskilling the Bord na Móna workers to carry out the work required under a deep retrofit scheme. Would the Minister consider Offaly for a pilot scheme to establish how we would get the deep retrofitting done? That would be important. I acknowledge that the Minister turned the sod recently on an exciting project initiated by Lumcloon Energy. It is a battery storage project and is the next phase in the energy field in Offaly. I thank him for attending on that occasion.

I recognise that there will be issues about developing a retrofit and ensuring that there is a skill-fit. I am conscious also that Offaly has some very good training facilities in Mount Lucas where there is the capacity to do any necessary reskilling. I would certainly be sympathetic to trying to pilot something specifically in the midlands. As I have indicated in the climate plan, we need to find a way of scaling up the level of activity. Area-based schemes may be a good way to do that and it would dovetail with the particular needs that may arise. I assure the Deputy that I and my staff, and the wider Government with the co-ordination role of the Department of the Taoiseach, is taking this very seriously. We recognise that to a significant extent this is a test of our capacity to manage difficult changes like this that are being thrown up by the climate challenge in a way that is fair to people and supports them to make the changes in their lives and to support a region that is particularly affected.

I share the serious concerns about the ongoing difficulties facing the beef sector and understand the frustration which has driven some farmers to engage in prolonged picketing of beef factories. Last weekend, I facilitated lengthy negotiations involving beef stakeholders to try to find a resolution to the current dispute. All parties agreed that it was crucial to find a means of getting the sector fully operational again and protecting the livelihoods involved, including both beef farmers and factory workers, whose jobs are at risk. The talks last weekend culminated in an agreement between the meat industry and seven farming organisations and representatives, all of whom undertook to support the agreement on the ground and recommend those on the protests to step back from their protest in response to this negotiated agreement. The agreement is a two-strand approach aimed at providing immediate financial benefits direct to beef farmers as well as addressing longer-term structural issues. A means to implement and measure progress on these measures was also set out and agreed. As part of the deal, beef producers will benefit from an immediate
increase in a range of bonuses, as follows: an increase of 66% in the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12 cent per kilogram to 20 cent per kilogram; the introduction of a new bonus of 8 cent per kilogram for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months, which meet all non-age-related existing in-spec criteria, and which up to now have not received any bonus; the introduction of a new in-spec bonus of 12 cent per kilogram for steers and heifers under 30 months in the categories of grade O- and fat score 4+, which currently do not qualify for any bonus; and the in-spec 70-day residency requirement will be reduced to 60 days on the last farm.These measures offer an immediate financial benefit for beef farmers. They both increase the level of bonus being paid and increase significantly the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus payment on top of the base price paid. A beef market task force is being established immediately to provide leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. I will appoint an independent chair to lead the task force. Its membership will comprise officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and relevant State agencies and nominees from farm organisations and the meat industry. The task force will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement. Furthermore, it will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities. Other key immediate actions include the development by Bord Bia of a beef market price index model and a scientific review of the quality payment grid by Teagasc. The second strand of the agreement sets out strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector. These measures will provide clear information and bring greater transparency to the sector with a view to ensuring sustainability of the sector into the future. A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain were agreed upon. The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers. The agreement includes commitments on an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector; an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain, the results of which will inform future actions, as necessary, and on which the beef industry will co-operate in providing data; and initiatives on improving information on carcass classification. There are also commitments with regard to more detailed price reporting, more reporting on carcass classification and on the transposition of the EU directive on unfair trading practices. I do not intend to read out the agreement in full. The full details are available on my Department’s website. However, I am satisfied that it contains the best balance of immediate financial benefits for beef farmers and a series of more medium-term strategic actions. In terms of other supports to the beef sector, I was pleased to be able to re-extend the application period for the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM. On 16 September, I announced the extension of the application period for the BEAM until 5 p.m. on Friday, 20 September. I was also pleased to announce that Department staff would be available to assist farmers in making their application at the Department's tent at the National Ploughing Championships this week in Fenagh, County Carlow. I encourage anyone who is eligible to apply to avail of this final opportunity to apply for the scheme. Any potential applicants who are unsure of the benefits or details of applying should visit the Department's tent at the National Ploughing Championships where a dedicated team will be on site each day to answer any queries potential applicants may have and assist in submitting their applications. It is very important to note the recognition, for the first time, of a beef producer organisation in Ireland on Wednesday, 11 September last. Producer organisations are an important part of the toolkit in building resilience in the sector by strengthening the position of the primary producer in the supply chain. Department officials have engaged extensively with potential groups since the inception of the measure in 2016 and one of the commitments from the Backweston agreement in August was that officials would engage to the fullest extent possible to assist with the establishment of beef producer organisations. This commitment was clearly demonstrated through the engagement with the established group, which has publicly acknowledged the level of support it has received from Department officials in this regard. Furthermore, the establishment of the group is an important and timely signal to farmers that they can collectively do business in a way that enables them to have increased bargaining power, as well as helping them to increase their economic and environmental efficiency through collaboration with the potential for enhanced knowledge-sharing and economies of scale. Funding providing support for the establishment of beef producer organisations is available under the current rural development programme. This funding is available to support the engagement of Department-approved facilitators to assist with the application process for recognition of producer organisations. Funding is available for each group, up to a total of €3,000. The Department is exploring the role producer organisations should play under the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and how best to facilitate this. Producer organisations not only have the potential to improve the position of farmers in the supply chain but also to provide strong relationships between the elements of the supply chain to the benefit of all. I will share the remainder of my time with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle. I will conclude by noting that collaboration and dialogue are the only way out of the current situation and the only way to secure the future of the beef sector. The entry into force of the agreement is contingent on the cessation of all protests and blockades. All parties to the agreement took responsibility for ensuring that this would happen by recommending the agreement to those they represent. The current situation is doing immeasurable damage to the sector and its reputation in our overseas markets, which account for 90% of all the beef we produce. The future of the beef sector is now in the balance and I appeal to all those still protesting to step back for the sake of their fellow farmers.

As a beef and suckler farmer, I recognise and appreciate the value the beef sector plays in rural Ireland, the role it plays in many communities and its value to our agrifood exports and reputation as clean, green and sustainable food producers.  It was inevitable that we would reach this point. Over the years, we have seen a progression from a point where farmers received most of their income from the marketplace to a point where every time there was a crisis, Governments responded to requests for further aid and support. This was accepted but at some point it had come to an end. We have moved to the current position. I commend the Minister, Department officials and the various other participants in the process on their efforts and willingness to engage with each other in recent weeks. They tried to come to an agreement and persuade two polarised sides to move a little bit and take a leap of faith. This has not been easy and challenges remain but I believe these can be overcome. We must first realise what has been achieved. The people who are still protesting do not realise what they have achieved by bringing this issue to the fore and concentrating minds, particularly in the meat processing industry, which, whether real or imagined, has taken the primary producer for granted. In a world with a growing population in which food production will become more important but seems to be taken for granted, it is ironic that Ireland, a country that can produce food as efficiently and sustainably as any other country and better than most countries, is coming under pressure from wider society and other sectors to curtail food production. That is nonsensical. I am a primary producer and it is a basic requirement that primary producers and the generations of producers that will follow feel that a viable livelihood and good quality of life is available to them. There is a quality of life but one cannot live on air. We have to ensure that the primary producer is recognised. The object of the exercise is to ensure that all concerned feel they have a fair and equitable return from and reward for their efforts. The issue has been the breakdown in trust and the adversarial attitude and relationship that have developed over the years. The talks have achieved a lot and I do not believe we will ever go back to a point where we have a cloak and dagger approach. As to what has been established by way of agreements, I accept that the base price remains an issue. However, the structure of the quality and bonus payment system over and above base is something to be very much welcomed. The talks have achieved a great amount. I do not believe that we will ever go back to the point where we have this cloak and dagger approach with what has been established by way of agreements. I accept that the base price remains an issue with the structure of the quality and bonus payment system over and above base is something I very much welcome.In other words, there is €25 million, or thereabouts, of new money in the system as matters stand as a result of that base price. Some 70% of all animals processed today will now qualify for a bonus. That is a positive.

We are establishing a task force that will oversee the implementation process and develop transparency. We will have an index developed, a review of the grid, what exactly the customer wants and that everybody will understand it. Most importantly, when we get to the point where we understand the overall pricing structure of the animal, we will know what is sold where, how much is the return and what is the overall margin so that primary producers can eventually feel they are getting a fair return, which is not too much to ask. However, we need to make a leap of faith and we need some cordial dialogue among the people who are on the picket lines, the plants being picketed and the major processors. We can get over this but the Members, as policymakers, can continue to respond. We have put in place numerous measures built on driving farm efficiency, be it the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, or the beef efficiency programme. We have established environmental measures and targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, for farm safety. We have brought in the exceptional aid package because of the market distortion. They are all fine insofar as what they achieve. Perhaps we need to consider moving in the direction of sustainable energy production, having solar panels on roofs and that type of thing in the future. However, we must get to the point where we move forward from this process in which the Minister, his team and the seven farm organisations engaged last weekend. The is the end of phase 1, not the end of the process. We are beginning phase 2 and we have an opportunity to embrace the structure that has been established to allow what has been achieved a chance to work. If it does not, I do not know what the answer is but I shudder to think of what will be the impact. In saying that, I am not placing the blame on anybody but that is the crux of the matter. We need to take a step back. Ultimately, we want primary producers to have a fair standard of living, and a fair reward for their work. We want them to be able to understand that is what they are getting through the task force, the index, and the grid so that we can plan for the future. Otherwise, we will see an inevitable change in the agricultural sector structure away from primary beef production to secondary beef production and arable production of whatever kind, but it will not be the same. The beef industry is vital. We face the double-whammy challenge of Brexit. We have engaged with people. In fairness to everybody involved, they stood back to allow the Chinese inspections take place. We faced that because of the outbreak of African flu in China and we sought to capitalise on that market which we worked to develop for many years. We have engaged in the slow, laborious process of the building of trust. We might be on the cusp of something and the last thing we need to do is to curtail our ability to supply that market because of something that is happening at the moment. I appeal to everybody, the processors and the people who are still on picket lines outside the plants to engage to see if a solution can be found in order to allow what has been achieved, which we should not underestimate, to be developed. Let us give it a chance.

It is unfortunate that the Dáil was not in session in recent weeks and that this is our first opportunity, but nonetheless a welcome one, to discuss it. Fianna Fáil will table a Private Members’ motion on this matter tomorrow. It is essential that what has happened since the protests began on 28 July must be seen as a watershed with regard to the position of farmers and the respect they get for the work they carry out. Farmers have been trampled on for too long. They have not been listened to or respected. They have consistently been obliged to put up with a situation whereby they have been the price takers while all others along the food supply chain have been able to set prices and continue with their margins. This issue has been bubbling up for years because the prices and the margins farmers have been getting have been consistently eroded to the extent that they cannot see a future for themselves in the sector unless things change. We must ensure that there is fair play for them. They feel they have been totally let down by meat processors in recent years. The fact that there is no clarity as to what margins farmers get for the work they carry out in producing beef illustrates the lack of transparency in the sector. We have seen estimates ranging from 20% of the final amalgamated price going to the beef producer, as indicated by the Beef Plan Movement, to an indication from Bord Bia that it could be 60%, to Phelim O’Neill, a very respected markets commentator in Irish Farmers' Journal, indicating, on the basis of his analysis, that it is 50%. The fact there is such a massive range in the percentage of the margin that goes to farmers in terms of the estimates shows the total lack of transparency there is in the system. Farmers feel, and rightly so, that they have been down by the Government. If we go back to the grain crisis or the fodder crisis, the Government has been unresponsive to farmers and their predicament. The most recent contribution by the Government in the context of the losses endured by farmers in the past year was the €100 million beef emergency aid measure scheme, which was announced in a blaze of glory the week before the local elections as a straightforward compensation scheme. It was sold that way a week prior to polling day only for farmers to hear a week later that it was laden with qualifications and conditions such as the 5% stock reduction. The Government knew the reaction that scheme would have got from farmers if the 5% stock reduction had been outlined prior to polling day. Again, farmers felt they were sold a pup and disrespected. Against that backdrop, it is no surprise that there have been protests in recent weeks. As others have observed, those protests have achieved a lot. It is now essential that we see an outcome that can be built upon and that can deliver for farmers. The response from the Minister in terms of the speed with which talks - either the first round or the second - were put together was not in any way as hands-on as it should have been in view of the gravity of the crisis. The first talks were put together on foot of an announcement made on a Wednesday but they were not scheduled until the following Monday. Likewise, when the second round was being put together, the Minister was much too hands-off in terms of ensuring that the leadership was not divided in order to get people back around the table, which was the only place where the matter could be resolved. Coming out of the weekend’s talks we have a deal on the table to which the seven farm organisations contributed with six of them actively advocating it and the seventh - the Independent Farmers of Ireland group - has indicated it is bringing it back to the picket lines. It is essential that we as politicians allow the time and space for the farming organisations to engage fully with their members and with farmers in terms of the merits of that deal. The comments made by the President at the National Ploughing Championships, in which he indicated that this may not be the best solution but that it can certainly be the best beginning, should be reflected upon by people. It is essential that the case made by farmers be built upon, that the four-movement rule, the residency rule and the 30-month rule, which are key issues for those on the picket lines, be genuinely and properly addressed in the coming months and that the task force will be set up promptly to address the issue of transparency in the beef sector. The other matter on which we need to see immediate action from the Minister is that relating to the need for additional aid from Europe in respect of the losses experienced in recent months.The beef exceptional aid measure scheme covers a reference period from September 2018 to May 2019 but the prices since May have been lower than those months covered by the reference period. It is absolutely essential that we see further aid now to compensate farmers for those losses experienced, to assist with the difficult experience they have had and to bring something additional to the table on their behalf. I will leave it to my colleagues to make their contributions. I certainly hope that we see a change of approach once and for all where farmers are recognised as the foundation of our beef sector, which needs to be respected, needs to have fair play and needs to provide a decent margin and a decent living for the important work it carries out.

The price farmers have been getting for a number of years has not been viable. These protests have not come about overnight. I refer to the desperation among farming families that their way of life is disappearing from under them. The single farm payment, in real terms, has been eroded over time. For a number of years, it covered up many of the deficiencies in the price being returned to the primary producer. Since I was elected to the Dáil in February 2016, the Government has not listened to my party on the plight of beef farming in this country. We have had numerous Private Members' motions and every month when there are questions to the Minister, we have raised the problems in the beef sector. We all knew, when quotas were discontinued in April 2015, that there would be an increase in livestock numbers in this country but we have failed to have the safety valve of live exports adequately utilised. We saw in the spring where we had the disaster of not having enough lairage space in Cherbourg for Friesian calves and, as we speak tonight, there are no cattle over 12 months of age leaving this country. We have had numerous markets announced for live exports but, unfortunately, no cattle are moving. Live exports were always the safety valve that kept pressure on the meat processors to pay a viable price. That was always what kept competition in the trade. Unfortunately, farmers have lost trust and confidence in parts of the industry. Farmers have lost confidence in Bord Bia. The question being asked is whether all the beef that is leaving this country is of Irish origin. Is the beef stamped as processed in this country being produced by Irish farmers? On the negotiations, while the Minister states there have been increases in the bonus, we can only judge that when we see the base price that the factories announce. Unfortunately, the differential in the price between cattle under and over 30 months still remains. There is the four-movement rule. While there has been some movement on the residency, none of these issues has been resolved to the satisfaction of farmers. Even allowing for this, I would urge the farmers on the picket line to allow the kill to recommence, but with a strict deadline of 1 January where the aspirations in this agreement can be assessed to see if they are being fulfilled. We need to get the autumn kill under way. Farmers need to sell cattle but they must be given assurances that what is in this agreement will not be allowed gather dust and that the aspirations in this agreement will be examined carefully and delivered on. The competition authority has failed farmers. I can give numerous examples of how this has happened. We need an independent authority to be brought in to examine fairness in this industry. Whether it is for rendering or for price, we need the competition authority to be brought to task. Before I hand over to other members of my party, I will refer to the Joint Committee of the Agriculture, Food and the Marine which had the competition authority in a couple of months ago to examine a scheme between Kepak and Glanbia. Under cross-examination, the head of the competition authority told us that the scheme was uncompetitive but because it was only for a small segment of the marketplace, she would not do anything about it. I said to her that day that it is okay for a processor to sin a little but not a lot. If that was farmers, the competition authority would take action.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	317	I endorse the words of my colleagues, Deputies McConalogue and Cahill, in regard to the serious financial pressures on beef farmers, not only now but for a considerable length of time. No enterprise can continue if it is producing product that is sold below the cost of production. That is not sustainable for any sector or for any commodity. We rightly use the word "sustainability" in the area of food production. The beef sector that is such a key ingredient of our overall agrifood sector is under serious pressure today. Deputy McConalogue spoke about confidence, as did Deputy Cahill. When there is not confidence in a sector, that necessary investment or commitment can ebb away very quickly. My party tabled a Private Members' motion in this House last March. We outlined in detail the issues that needed to be addressed by the Minister and by the Government. Some of them were dealt with to some extent in the agreement reached on Sunday last. We had the area of the 30-month age restriction, the four-month rule, the 70 days' residence. It is time to listen to the eminent Professor Paddy Wall in regard to the age restriction. Thankfully, we are a long time away from the BSE era when those restrictions were quite rightly put in place. I put questions to the Minister and to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, in regard to the implementation of the EU Directive on Unfair Trading Practices in the Agricultural and Food Supply Chain. In fairness, the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, brought that forward, warts and all. It was a step in the right direction but the Minister, Deputy Creed's replies to me indicated no urgency in transposing that EU directive into legislation here. It is another ingredient that would be extremely important in tackling the serious issues confronting the beef sector.

Ba mhaith liom cúpla ceist a chur ar na hAirí. Why do the Ministers not listen and why are they reactive rather than proactive? My colleagues and I warned them time and again of impending crises, including the one we are in now, and they bring it to the wire on every occasion and wait until the horse has bolted to try to do anything. March last, my colleagues and I brought forward a motion that included much of what they agreed in their talks over the weekend. If the Minister had listened that time and heeded us, we might not be in the crisis that we are in now. I met many farmers in west Cork over the summer. They are on their knees. The prices they are getting are not viable. They cannot make a living. As well as that, there is the knock-on effect in respect of workers in the meat factories around the country, one of which is in my home town. Many people have lost their jobs, perhaps temporarily. Many have faced changes in circumstances where they have had to go to Poland. This is a significant loss to the economy of my town of Bandon and I plead with the Ministers to try to sort this crisis out.

It is fair to say that this issue has been dragging on far too long. The talks, which the Minister convened belatedly, have yielded some result but it is important we realise that this is only the beginning of the process of sorting out the issue for beef farmers. There is no other business - farming is a business - where the primary producer would be expected to operate at a loss. It simply would not happen. The most basic rule in economics is that one has turnover for vanity and profit for sanity. If a farmer cannot make a profit, he or she will not make income to exist. In my constituency, when farmers are making money, they will invest it in their farm enterprises and in their local economy. I ask the Minister, in conjunction with all of us, to ensure the task force that has been established will follow through, that the base price issue will be addressed, that the other issues, including the 30-month rule, the four movements and lairage, will be addressed conclusively and properly so that we can tell beef farmers in Limerick and beyond that they will have a future farming in this country. Otherwise, we are in dire straits.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	320	The lack of trust in the meat processing industry among farmers is enormous. For years, farmers have not believed they have been getting a fair return from the marketplace. In their minds and the minds of a lot of people, the Minister has failed as an independent arbitrator to put in place a regulator that would have brought some transparency to who gets what from every kilogram of beef that is sold. There is a belief among farmers that while other players in the industry - the processors, traders, retailers, hauliers and contractors - all get their margin and all get paid ultimately, the farmer has to take the price that is given with no reference whatever to the cost of his or her production. That cannot be maintained. It has to change. No other aspect of Irish society operates on the basis of being a price-taker regardless of the cost. So much of the livelihoods of others depends on the primary producer. Now people are starting to talk about the employees in the factories and to realise that there are others who depend on the livelihoods of farmers. If the farmer is not able to sustain a living for his or her family, all the other consequences will flow from that and it will impact on many others in society. The Minister must understand that many farmers, particularly those in designated disadvantaged areas, are unable to finish cattle in less than 30 months without using expensive meals and rations. There is no justification whatever for the 30-month rule. It must increase to 36 months without delay. Most people fail to understand why it has been allowed to continue. The issue of residency also has to be addressed. It has to be reduced to 30 days. The four movement rule must also be addressed. If the Minister intends to stand by and watch the dairy herd grow by a further 30% in the next five years, he will be credited with the destruction of the beef farming sector. It makes no sense in terms of the impact it will have on the beef sector or in terms of our climate change commitments. That aspect needs to be addressed too.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	321	I acknowledge that the Minister has engaged with me behind the scenes as we attempted to get some type of settlement for this situation. It is very important that I put that on the public record this evening. However, as far as I am concerned, the game is up in terms of the farmers being promised a fair deal on the extraordinarily good product they produce in the way they rear their cattle. This is why people are holding out. While I acknowledge that there are some very good things in what has been put on the table, I will make one plea to the Minister and the processors this evening. I urge them to meet the Beef Plan Movement people again. This problem can be solved with a little bit of understanding from both sides. Everybody wants it solved. People have spoken about the farmers. There are workers and their families living in desperation as to where this is going. A young man with borrowings and leasings of almost €200,000 on a couple of Scania trucks told me that if this continues for another two weeks, all the business he was getting out of the factories will be gone. A lot of people are affected by this and many of them are very worried. We have to make every attempt to get this over the line. I appeal to those processors who are listening this evening to move one little bit. We can do this. We can get further discussions going behind the scenes. I am confident we can get this sorted out in 48 hours. Many people are troubled and upset. We owe it to those in the farming community who are producing an outstanding product to give them a little leeway. Trust is gone and it has to be rebuilt in the farming sector, or else we are going nowhere. I appeal to the Minister to get those people to take one more step to get this over the line. I believe we can have a settlement on this matter.

I acknowledge the commitment of all the farmers across the country who took the difficult decision to go on the picket line over the past two months. It is unfortunate that it has come to this. It is because of those farmers that the issue is now on the agenda. I have spoken to many farmers who were at the factory gates. They did not protest out of choice. They stood on the picket line because they felt they simply had no other option. This was their last opportunity to save their livelihoods. They are taking to the picket line for the simple reason that it is no longer economically viable for Irish beef farmers to produce at a baseline price of €3.45 per kilo. Teagasc is telling us that to be any way viable, as a break-even price they have to be getting €4.17 per kilo. That is basic economic reality. All the signs are that the protests outside the factory gates will continue until the baseline price increases. Everybody wants this solved but that is a fact we have to recognise. Beef farmers are caught in a perfect storm. Not only is their margin squeezed, with some of them going backwards financially into the negative, but they are also facing the effects of Brexit and the looming Mercosur deal. Farmers are going out of business. Beef farmers can no longer support themselves and their families. Some families are facing the prospect of losing properties such as their homes. They have large debts for on-farm investments that they have made in recent years. They were borrowing money to buy fodder because of the fodder crisis last year, and saw the effects of that going into spring this year. How has it got to this? This has developed over the past two and a half decades. We have allowed the Irish beef sector to be run in a cartel-like manner by very powerful people with very strong political connections. Why has their power been left unchecked for so long? It is a cartel-like situation where those running it can decide whenever they like to manipulate beef prices for their own selfish reasons. That is being done in a number of ways, including through feedlots, the only purpose of which is to ensure that the price of beef is suitable for the cartel-like owners and processors. That is the situation that Irish beef farmers have been up against on a daily basis. That is why they are so angry. One of the solutions is to provide greater transparency. During the summer recess, I published the Mandatory Beef Price Transparency Bill 2019 as an attempt to contribute to a solution. We understand that this is not a silver bullet. It does not meet all of the farmers' demands and will not solve everything. I am not naive enough to think that. It goes some way towards ending any suggestion of manipulation in prices. The factories would be compelled legally to report into the system daily. It would go some way towards ending the high level of mistrust between the farmers and factories. I have never seen such mistrust. I have been in situations involving striking workers and employers where there was little trust and great anger on both sides. However, I have never seen the level of mistrust and anger that is involved in this situation. I am taken aback by how far people have gone with this. We have to try to rebuild, as we all recognise. Only then will we be able to see the huge gap between what the customer pays and what the farmer gets, and who is being ripped off.  I recognise that progress has been made in the beef talks with regard to better bonuses and premiums for cattle, and also that the processors have agreed to drop all legal action against protestors. There are some positive steps but they do not go far enough. I also want to say to the Minister, in a helpful way, that the statement put out on his Facebook page last evening has not helped matters, unfortunately. I met farmers today who were taken aback by some of the content. Those farmers who are represented by the Independent Farmers of Ireland do not believe they are being unreasonable or difficult for the sake of it. They do not want to be on the picket line and would prefer to be on their farms working. They feel they have no other choice because the deal does not go far enough. All they want is a fair deal. All the signs are that they will not leave the picket lines no matter who tries to talk to them unless the baseline price is dealt with and trust is rebuilt. Farmers who have been protesting in places like Rathdowney and at the National Ploughing Championships today are loud and clear that they will not go home and we will be back in the same situation in six months' time unless those issues are dealt with.The sums do not add up. I recognise that new premium payments have been proposed that will increase bonuses for quality cattle, but the big suspicion is that the processors will simply reduce the baseline price, which would completely wipe out the bonus payment. The Minister said there will be a bonus payment for 70% of all cattle being killed. That is good, but the problem is that every farmer to whom I have spoken firmly believes the factories will simply pull down the baseline payment. I say that with all sincerity to the two Ministers present. They believe that is the next move. Farmers are the most vulnerable link in the beef supply chain. It is time we put an end to that. The beef sector needs a more proactive approach. It needs the Minister to get all the stakeholders back around the table for one last time to get the deal over the line for all farmers, especially the small and medium sized farmers who are outside the factories picketing out of sheer desperation. They are out there because they know this is their last stand. They know that this is the last opportunity they have to save their livelihoods. That is the reality. The information I have is that there is a monopoly situation in meat processing. The five major producers depend on one company to take the offal. One major operator can effectively manipulate the industry if it wishes. I urge the Minister to take the issue seriously and to respond to me on it in the coming days. The situation must be investigated by the Department and by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as a matter of urgency, because if one major operator controls one part of the processing industry it has huge influence over the other four processors. If we want a beef industry then farmers need to receive a fair price because if the farmers do not have a livelihood and are producing at a loss we know where this is going. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is a farmer as well. It is the iron law of economics that one cannot run at a loss over a period. The processors know that as well. Further progress is needed. The beef emergency aid measure must be renewed and improved. The €50 million is available but it is restrictive. Another scheme is needed because we are in a crisis. We must sustain farm families, keep the beef industry in this country and make sure that we have a good quality beef industry. We must get the current dispute resolved, get the factories back open again and ensure farmers have a fair price for quality produce.

They are not the farmers who are running the factory farms or feedlots; they are small farmers who run family farms and graze their cattle outdoors. It is the type of farming that we should encourage as it produces the high quality beef a lot of us eat and that is sold around the world because of its quality. I get a real sense of injustice from the farmers I meet on the picket line. I also met some of the leaders of the groups off the picket lines to discuss their issues. They are also taken aback and not pleased with some of the narrative around the protests that the farmers are protesting in a militant way. They are just people who want to provide for their families, who are reasonably standing up for themselves and their families and who are not getting a fair price for what they produce. They are not even getting a price that is necessary to allow them to do what they want to do. It is simply becoming unviable for many farmers. That is made all the worse when they are up against the big beef barons. When I was in college I heard in debates in this House about the big beef barons who had connections with very senior politicians. The big beef barons are still there and they are still running the show. They are very powerful individuals and they are squeezing the farmers dry. It is the family farmers who are being squeezed dry by those individuals. I know a lot of people who work in the factories. I have every sympathy for all of the people who have been laid off, who are being treated as pawns. They are being used by some of the big beef barons as well because they want to use them as pawns. Most of them are on very low pay. We might say we have a difficult job but I know a lot of people who work in the meat processing plants and it is a very difficult job, which they do for very low pay. There are anti-trade union practices in some of the companies as well. They are the people we are dealing with and they are the people farmers are unfortunately having to go up against. Deputy Stanley is correct: there is a monopoly or a sense of a monopoly at play here. We have a responsibility to deal with that. We all know that the ingredient for the resolution of any conflict, protest or dispute is, in the first instance, negotiation and that people are around the table. There must also be a level playing field without preconditions. In addition, there must be a sense of fair play and that there will be a fair outcome from the talks for the farmers. Despite the fact that some farming organisations have signed up to the deal, while farmers recognise there has been some progress, which is without a doubt, they still do not believe there has been fair play. That is a problem for all of us, not for one party or for the Government, because we collectively have to make sure that we do our best for the farmers who want to produce the food and the beef that some but not all of us consume and the produce that is sold around the world and creates jobs in many areas.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	324	The problem is that the system is broken. That has been the case for quite a while. The Minister is aware of that, as is everyone who has been involved in the situation. It goes back 25 to 30 years since we had the consolidation of all the small meat processing plants around the country into the hands of a very small number of people. That created a situation where we were told that the market would solve the problem and that we would have new efficiencies. Those new efficiencies have led to a situation where, first, the people who work in the meat processing plants nowadays, by and large, are foreign labourers who have come into the country because of the very low wages that are being paid. Years ago, there were many meat factories in my area and one always knew the farmers who worked in them because they wore white wellingtons. They stood out. There were loads of them. They worked in the meat factories in Longford, Dromod and Rooskey and the situation was the same in every county in the country. Nowadays, there is a handful of factories and all of the people working in them are foreign labour because the pressure was downwards, not just on the wages paid to the workers but also on the money they paid for the animals. It is the same thing: the farmers are being treated in the very same way. There has been downward pressure in order to provide the product at a cheaper price supposedly, but really what is happening is that all the money is being taken by the processors in the middle. That is the problem. The farmers cannot continue like this. The point has been made several times that it is an international market and that we get the average price that is paid in Europe. We do, but the problem is that the product in this country is not the average product. It is different. It is unique. We have a family farm setting. The animals are free-roaming and grass-fed and there is traceability from farm to fork. Nowhere else does that, yet we have an average price. Farmers are seething with anger that they are being used in this situation. The Minister is aware of that. He spent some 40 hours at the negotiating table with them. What we must do is recognise that the key to the situation is price. It is ludicrous to say that price cannot be discussed. If one is going to bargain about anything, it is the price one has to bargain about. Farmers need to get a base price that reflects the level of work and effort they put in. I do not need to tell the Minister that; he knows it, but, unfortunately, the system that has been set up is not in favour of the primary producer, the people who work in the meat plants or the consumer but in favour of those in the middle who make all the money and who are ripping off the entire hard-working community whom we see at the ploughing championships and across the country. Rural communities depend on the farming community to be vibrant and sustainable. If the farming community is vibrant and making money then everyone makes money. We need to get back to the price. Until we get to that point and increase the base price for the animals going into the factory, we are going nowhere.

It was false because the talks did not deal with the main issue, namely, the base price. We would not have a beef industry without beef and suckler farmers. We would not have all of those people employed in the industry. How can farmers continue to produce beef below cost?How can they sustain that? How can they keep that going? I cannot understand for the life of me how farming organisations came out and were half-welcoming what was agreed. It was a false negotiation. The negotiations have to be about price. If it was not about production price, it meant absolutely nothing. It meant nothing to the people in the west of Ireland with 20 suckler cows and who are trying to rear good beef cattle. It meant nothing to them because they are producing below cost. There is a situation where the multiples and the cartels are dictating the negotiations and terrorising farmers by telling them they would get injunctions and take their land. That is what they have been propagating and putting out there. I am told the same cartels employed for very low wages people who are non-Irish nationals and not alone do they employ them but they house them and charge them €100 a week for a bed in a house that they share with somebody else. These are the people we are talking about, these people who control the whole industry and by extension have influence over the political system in the State, and nothing is being done about it. It was a shameful negotiation. I fully support the independent farmers who have picketed and continue to picket. I will be there with them because they are fighting to survive and fighting for their livelihoods. They have been neglected and betrayed by those who represent them at certain levels. How do we deal with it? We deal with the cartels, and with the people who take a quarter for themselves and allow nothing to go back to the producers. We deal with the fact that while we know what the processors pay for cattle, we do not know what they get from the big multiple retailers. A Bill is being brought forward by Deputy Stanley to try to address that issue. It will be very interesting see how many Deputies in this House, in particular Government Deputies, will back it. The Bill will ensure processors have to show what they are getting for beef and what the big retail units are paying for it. We know what the consumer pays for it and we know what the producer gets for it, but we do not know what happens in between. We also need an investigation into the abuse of workers by these cartels.

Couple this with the no-deal Brexit and we could be facing even stronger threats to the viability of farming in Ireland. Farmers are seeing that the action they have taken over recent weeks is their only option. They see this dispute as the last stand before their livelihoods are wiped out completely and gone forever. I am also very conscious of the 4,000 workers within the factories who have faced or are facing lay-offs. However, if we are to be honest, it is not fair that the factories are using factory workers as pawns to turn communities against each other, when all the farmers want is a fair price for their product, as we have heard many times. On a point that nobody has hit upon today, the highest rate of suicide in Ireland is among those aged 45 to 54. We know anecdotally that many farmers have taken their lives in recent years and we know that economic desperation kills. There is an escalating and basic point that people are not seeing. Factories need farmers' products, workers need to work and farmers need to produce beef to sell it. The only solution is to sit down and to talk honestly. I recognise that some, if very little, progress has been made but, for many, it is simply not enough. As has been brought up many times in the House, and if Members will pardon the pun, the main beef is the price that farmers are getting paid. The product we have in Ireland is unique and is one of the best in the world. Why should we be penalised? The overall objective is to ensure sustainability of livelihoods for everyone involved. Without proper dialogue and discussion by all stakeholders, we could see another situation like the loss of the Mallow beet factory or the fertiliser industry in Cobh. Surely nobody wants to see the beef industry going in the same direction. I appeal for everybody to sit down and to be honest. It is time the Government treated the farming industry, the families and the communities they support, as well as the workers, with honesty. If there are cartels, collusion or fraud, now is the time to stamp it out. Do not let these families be cast aside and left alone to die under the grass because there will not be cattle there to eat it, only themselves.

I am the longest-serving and oldest member of the Oireachtas agriculture committee - I went on it in 1993, a long time ago. I remember when I protested strongly against the cartel movement and certain individuals taking over particular industries and consolidating them. I was nearly trampled by farmers for opposing those things - I was being a communist, I suppose. Many who spoke today would be people who opposed the views I articulated at that time and which I still hold. When we create monopolies and cartels, the victims are the people at the lowest rung of the ladder. Monopolies and cartels have exercised muscle, power and monopoly, and they give people what they like and that is what people have to take. The last thing we should do in the Dáil is contribute to any misinformation or mislead the farming public into thinking that certain objectives are achievable which may not be so and in effect advocate for the legitimate expectations which can arise from over-promising and from false hope. I know this because I stood on the picket lines with many farmers and, indeed, I did a lot more work behind the scenes, helping out certain organisations - that is all I will say about that at this point. My advice has always been very straight and strict. At the end of the day, this will come down to price. Cool heads need to prevail on all sides. We need to reflect carefully on the agreement that has been reached in the past number of days. Some people have doubts as to the bona fides and the trust that one can invest in the processors and there is understandable anxiety that they would ever honour anything. However, insofar as we can take people at some degree of trust, I think this heralds an opportunity for a new beginning to secure the necessary improvements in farm incomes from beef enterprise. A significant amount of progress was made and a significant number of the objectives that were set out by the various organisations involved, some of which I was advising, have been achieved, which must be acknowledged. I and my Labour Party colleagues have certainly listened carefully to what the President said this evening, namely, this is the first step. The oak tree did not grow overnight: the acorn seed was there and from there significant progress was fleshed out. Although I do not go around the press looking for any kudos, I have done a lot of work behind the scenes and I have many contacts. I believe a small increase in the base price, along with the other achievements, would bring everybody around to accepting that this is the first step. I hope this can be achieved. Agreements, by their very nature, are predicated on compromise, which eventually means that none of the parties achieves what they set out as their objectives or goals at the beginning. Farmers are justifiably frustrated about the low price of beef compared to the price of production and the desperate income situation that prevails on so many farms, which would be worse only for the single farm payment system. Partial decoupling came in during 2001 and then full decoupling happened in 2005 and decoupled payments from output. Those have become devalued in terms of purchasing power, which is another issue. The single farm payment was brought in to complement price, which we should not forget, and that was said at the time by the Commissioner. I was there. I was listening carefully to all of this and I took it in. There has been a perfect storm brewing in agriculture. I did a study in 1983, when there were 120,000 suckler cows. In 2013, there were 1.17 million suckler cows. I warned about this and there was cacophony of sound from everybody and every party in this House except myself. I warned about Food Harvest 2020 and about the 2025 targets for cattle. When the abolition of milk quotas took place, I warned about what would happen. What did happen? There were 290,000 extra milk cows.

That is the story. Then, we had people bellowing and roaring that they wanted us to provide subsidies so they could export calves, the very same crowd who were buying calves down the south for €2 or €4.They then wanted a subsidy and extra lairage. Imagine having the neck to come into a committee and ask for that. I know of many rural shops that are closing, and they do not ask for subsidies. They employ many people but did not get many subsidies or much sympathy from anybody here. Let us be clear about a few things. How dare anybody come looking for subsidies? They are getting calves for nothing and then they want somebody to subsidise them to go abroad. God bless us. It is horrible stuff. This is a perfect storm. Just look at what is happening regarding the CAP payment. We will lose €12 billion. Apart from Brexit, there are other factors. There is a €12 billion hole that has to be filled. That will be single farm payments. Ireland has indicated, through the Taoiseach and the Minister, that we will play our part, but other countries, the four big ones, are resisting. There is not a word of capitulation from them yet, that they will help fill in the deficit, and that will mean further trouble. Then we have the Mercosur deal hanging there. There are the climate change issues as well as the supermarket retailers. We had better be careful here. I keep telling every farmer - I spoke at a fairly big meeting a few weeks ago - that out of every ten calves produced, nine must be exported and only one is eaten at home. That includes the Pat McDonaghs and the seven big retailers, the multiples. That is all that is eaten at home. I want to go after the retailers and get them in here, but they refuse. In 2010 I was Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They refused to come before the committee to explain themselves. The processors, Mr. Goodman, ABP, Dawn Meats and all the others, are private unlimited companies, so we do not know what they are doing or how much money they are making. It is the same with the retailers, the big multiples, so nobody knows. That is the big problem and the reason Jim Power has done a study and thinks it is 40% to 45%, the difference between the take from them - the primary producer, the retailer and the processor. The processor says the farmer is getting 65%. The primary producer, the farmer, says he is only getting 20%. Nobody knows anything. It is all guesstimate work, and when we get that transparency and a price regulator in place, then we will know. We have been calling for that for many years, but it is probably not that easy. Do not tell me about the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. If there is a little business somewhere, it will find some method of ensuring that it drags it before the appropriate courts. I was on a committee in 2010 and 2011 with Ned O'Keeffe and so on. We actually hired a master's degree student to try, under darkness, to investigate whether there was a cartel. My view is that if it looks like a cartel and walks like one, it has to be one.

Some of us here try to invent reality, but I face reality, I am pragmatic and I try to get solutions. If we solve this thing tomorrow, I ask colleagues not to be fooled. I will be gone out of here.

Sticking-plaster solutions are grand, they get one over the hole, but that is no good because long term, this will implode. I have always held that view of this industry. It is a €3 billion industry. We have falling prices. We are talking €3.50 or €3.60. If a farmer got the €3.60 and could get the various things that are promised, premiums and subsidies and the like, we would get close to €4, but anybody going out of here tonight and pretending that €4 is achievable this evening or tomorrow is grossly misleading and telling lies to people.

I have another profession but I trained as an agricultural economist with Professor Sheehy, and the one thing he always told us as economists was to tell the truth, and I am telling the truth to people from experience and knowledge. We carried out those studies 40 years ago, so let us be clear. Beef production output in the EU has gone up by 2%. It is now 102% self-sufficient. Here we are exporting nine out of ten animals to an area that is 102% self-sufficient. That is why we have to get to the Chinese and all those other markets. Some of them are not as profitable as others. I heard somebody giving out about Bord Bia. I always saluted Bord Bia because I know some of the people in there. Aidan Cotter has retired from it now. He was a person who was deeply committed to getting the best for Irish agriculture and the beef and sheep sectors and he did an excellent job. I know he has gone on to something else now and I wish him well. All these things have created a problem, so the current situation is just a manifestation of long-term problems that did not come up overnight. There is no mushroom thing in this. This has been welling up for the past 25 years.

I keep warning my own brother about the suckler cow. For the last ten years, I have been warning him to be careful but the reason most farmers continue is that they have an inherent love for what they do in an open-air setting and he is as happy as Larry. For beef farmers, €4,791 was the average income in 2018, and 125% of their farm income is made up of the single farm payment. The average single farm payment in the country is about €13,000-odd. Of course, too many lords and ladies are getting this subsidy, including one of the major beef processors, which is seeking injunctions against people. It is one of the biggest recipients of this. It goes back again to my time as a young man, green behind the ears. I objected to that. I am on the record many years ago saying there should be no place for subsidies for corporate farmers or anything of that nature. They should get nothing. I was proposing capping it 20 years ago and people said, "Oh, sure, that fella comes from the Labour Party and they are communists." That included some farmers and farm organisations, and it was farm organisations that did not have the guts to come along and say what they thought. Why should farmers from the west of Ireland get about €5,000 or €4,000 in subsidies, if they are lucky, and some very rich well-to-dos with 250 or 1,000 acres get €105,000, €110,000 or €120,000? It does not make sense.

So let us be honest with one another. That is the place to start. Dairy is profitable and in 2018 the average income was €43,000. I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that Irish beef is produced to the highest environmental, welfare and traceability standards. With green grass production, everything is great and there is traceability from the farm gate to the fork. We have all that but all those issues will not go away, and I did talk about the abolition of the milk quotas. I think the Minister may well remember that. I advocate that he deal with some of the issues. Red meat clearly has an important role in a balanced diet, and that must be emphasised and not lost sight of.As producers of a commodity, beef farmers are effectively price takers. We have approximately 70,000 beef farmers and approximately 1.8 million cattle processed by 35 processing plants in a year. This is a recurring flashpoint. I hope we resolve it tomorrow. I plead with farmers to reflect carefully and not to be misled. Teagasc has set out a figure of €4. That is the objective. That objective will not be achieved in a flash. It could be attained with a combination of things that are integral to the agreement that was reached last Sunday. We all know that operating at a loss is not a long-term strategy. What worries me, as I have said to people on the picket lines, is that looming over the current adverse situation is the shadow of Brexit. We could see the implementation of World Trade Organization rules. That would mean we would be uncompetitive in our largest market, with the UK market taking 50% of our beef exports. We will not be talking about €4 but wondering if we will get to €3. Let us be clear that is what would happen. Can producer groups help? This critical mass of farmers banding together would facilitate negotiations with the processors. A number of them have been in operation. I know the Minister has given the go-ahead lately. Everyone needs to know that when one is in a producer group, one cannot go running around. People have to band together. Getting three quarters of a cent extra somewhere else should not make one leave the pitch. People have to stick with their producer group. I have met farmers who ran away when this sort of thing arose. Farmers should stick with producer groups. I see fixed-price contracts as a better way forward. As it is now, the farmer takes all the risk. If a farmer has a fixed-price contract, he or she knows what he or she will get. Irrespective of currency devaluation, fluctuations or market conditions, the farmer knows what he or she will get and that is safe and secure. Farmers have to work towards that. It would involve sharing the risk between processors and producers or farmers. That is to reassure farmers and give them confidence. We have to think outside the box. The day of just bringing the animal to the mart, getting dinner in the middle of the day and going home, like we all did, and socialising, which is an important part of the mart, is diminished unless we change things through those new strategies. We have an opportunity. Given the importance of farming to the rural economy and our traditional way of life, the job of Government is to assist farmers who have been struggling for years. The Minister has to talk to the EU. He has the €100 million and the beef is there. I brought to his attention one of the deficiencies. Young farmers under 35, who are well qualified, and started to build up a farm three or four years ago, are being asked to take a 5% reduction. That is a nonsense. We have to have a situation where they can continue and to ensure that they are protected and not subject to reductions. They are only getting on their feet. It is important that condition is applied and that exemption is available for them, otherwise we are setting off on a fool's errand. We have to have a sustainable future for farm workers. It would be remiss of me, as we discussed today in our Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, not to mention that a group which is largely forgotten with the current situation is the workers. Some 6,000 workers have been laid off, including by C&D Foods. Three rang me recently who are being laid off. They are worried about the uncertainty that they face. They have nothing with which to feed their children, to pay mortgages or to pay for cars. That is significant. They are working in the past. It is low-paid, precarious work. Meat Industry Ireland initially refused to negotiate with the farmers. In fairness to the Minister, he got it to the point of negotiating. It also refused to engage with the trade unions representing workers. The workers were told they could apply for social welfare payments when they were laid off. SIPTU told me that many workers in meat plants have come from abroad on specific work permits and are not allowed to apply for social welfare or to go for other jobs. Meat plants are a source of employment in many rural areas where few other jobs are available. In planning for a sustainable future for the beef industry in Ireland, provision of alternative jobs for meat factory workers must be a central consideration if, as seems likely, the beef processing industry will shrink. That is my position.

Some 6,000 workers have been laid off in total. Thousands more are facing lay-offs and those who have been laid off temporarily fear that it will be more than temporary. In this dispute to date, we have heard the voice of the meat industry, the Government and, at least to some extent, the voice of the farmers. It is time for the voice of the meat factory workers to be heard. I encourage them to raise their voices and to get organised to defend their interests in their area, their workplace and throughout the country, since it is a national issue. Other speakers have pointed out that meat factories have attempted to join trade unions and have attempted to win recognition in their workplace for their trade unions. That recognition has been denied. An attempt has been made to push them back when they have tried to organise. When the meat factories reopen, they should be organised, unionised workplaces and the meat factory workers need to begin a discussion on that now. They can take a degree of inspiration from the farmers because the farmers have stood and fought their ground against powerful forces in the establishment. The meat industry and beef barons are a powerful force. Attempts have been made to use the courts against them, including court injunctions. The farmers have stood their ground and defied that successfully. Workers, and not just meat factory workers, can and should take some inspiration from that. If meat factory workers are discussing the position they find themselves in and the threat of temporary lay-offs being more than temporary, then an issue which needs to be discussed and considered is the idea of saying that workers would go into the meat factories and stay there, state that these are their jobs and they will not leave until they have their jobs back. That would need to be at least discussed and considered. When the plants reopen, will there be a fair and just settlement or not? There should be a just settlement for the farmers and their families. The farmers say that for €10 paid on beef, they get €2, with €2.90 going to the processors and a majority, €5.10, going to the big retailers. That is an extremely unjust division of the spoils.Average farm income in this country was €23,000 last year but the average dry-stock farm income was only €10,000. There are farmers on those picket lines who live in poverty with their families. The core issue here is the base price for cattle which has dropped from €4 per kilogram last year to €3.45 per kilogram now and the talks last weekend did not change that. It seems to me that the mood among the protesting farmers is that the base price issue must be addressed. The final say on whether the protest continues will not be in the hands of the beef processors, the Government or the President, for that matter; it will be with those farmers at the factory gates. They are the ones who have to make the decision and there needs to be an increase in the base price to have any chance of a settlement here. If they reject the current proposal, they are well within their rights to do so. It is a democratic issue for a group who are involved in a campaign. It will then have to be resolved on the basis of a better offer being made. The Labour Party representatives have left the Chamber but I always enjoy listening to Deputy Penrose. He referred twice to the Labour Party being mistaken for communists but I do not know if there are too many people who would make that mistake these days. He also commented on a relative of his who he said was as happy as Larry, which was an interesting phrase to use in a debate about the beef industry. Deputy Penrose was right to say that there are other crises looming for the beef industry, including Brexit. The Government's position, as I understand it, is that in the event of strong blows to agribusiness and the beef industry in the course of a no-deal Brexit, for example, subsidies will be provided by the State to the industry. One of the stated aspirations is to help to protect jobs but as I understand it - and I ask the Minister to clarify this - it is not intended to make the protection of jobs a condition of state aid. It seems to be more of a hit-and-hope scenario; here is the state aid and we hope that you do not make as many people redundant or lay off as many as would otherwise be the case. What is being proposed here is to give State subsidies to some of the richest business people in the country, those who dominate the beef trade, namely, the beef barons, who have attempted to drive this dispute in order to starve farmers back to work, to get their own way and defend their own profits. As other speakers have rightly said, they have also attempted to use thousands of workers, including low-paid and vulnerable workers with families, as pawns to get their way.  I am in favour of State intervention to protect jobs in the event of a Brexit crisis. However, I am in favour of a different type of intervention to that being proposed. I was on radio last week, on C103, a station well known to the Minister. I spoke to Ms Patricia Messinger, an interviewer who is also known to the Minister, who had been debating the beef crisis for an hour beforehand. I had not had a chance to listen to the previous debate and was coming in cold. I raised what I thought might be a new idea for the debate, namely, that the beef industry should be taken out of the hands of the beef barons. I suggested that it should be taken out of private ownership and, in the interests of society, placed in public ownership and under democratic control. To my surprise, she said that I would not believe the number of phone calls and messages that the station had gotten that day supporting that very idea. I think she thought that I had been listening in and was jumping on the bandwagon but I was actually coming to the discussion cold. That is an idea that would be popular in society. It would certainly be popular among meat workers who would see it linked to the defence of jobs and it would be popular among protesting farmers who would see it as a way to achieve a more just solution than the one being offered by the beef barons and profiteers. I am putting on the table in this debate the idea of public ownership of the beef industry, under democratic control. I could make some points about the supermarkets in that context but time precludes it. Perhaps I will raise that issue again on another day. Finally, Friday is a day of global strike action on the issue of climate change. Once more school students across the world will leave their schools and come out onto the streets to demand change to protect the climate and defend the environment. Friday's strike will have a new element to it because for the first time significant numbers of workers and trade unionists will participate. I understand that in Britain, for example, four major trade unions have called on people to take action on Friday. That will be a new element, although in the main, it will still be a protest of young people. That shows which way the wind is blowing. Agriculture based primarily on beef, given the climate crisis, is not sustainable over time. In any case, there is a new generation that is eating and will eat a lot less meat and many have made the decision not to eat meat at all because of climate change. We need a sustainable agriculture and that means that there must be a transition away from beef but that transition must be just. It must be a just transition for all, including the workers in the industry and the farmers who supply it at the moment. Such a just transition cannot and will not be achieved on the basis of market economics or on the basis of control of the industry by beef barons and profiteers. It can only be done on the basis of State intervention, subsidies and public ownership of the industry under the democratic control of the workers in the industry and of the farmers who supply it.

We need to bring about a situation where beef farmers have a fixed share of the price paid by supermarket customers for beef products. A lot of anger is being expressed by farmers around the country at the moment regarding cattle specifications and also the difference between the supermarket price and the factory gate price. We need to see transparency in this area. The price margins that are operating across the beef chain must be transparent and clear. A robust mechanism must be put in place to ensure that farmers get their fair share of the final retail price for their animals. The fact is that the further the animal goes from the farm gate, the less information is made available on price. That is why beef price transparency across the supply chain must be addressed in the context of securing a fixed but fair proportion of the final price for beef farmers. The agreement between the meat industry and farm organisations that the Minister secured last weekend provides the basis for starting to rebalance power within the beef sector but we need to see movement on the base price for beef from the meat processors.The fact is that there is a serious lack of trust among farmers, and there is a feeling that the base price will now be manipulated by meat processors to make up for concessions agreed in the talks at the weekend. This cannot be allowed to happen if there is to be a resolution to the dispute. We need to see a fair base price quoted by processors. While many are legitimately arguing that price cannot be discussed, there is no legitimate argument not to seek a secure margin for farmers, who are producing a premium product not just for the Irish market but also for the EU beef market. Sean O'Rourke's interview earlier today with Mr. Cormac Healy of Meat Industry Ireland was very interesting. Mr. Healy stated that the industry is paying €3.60 per kilogram for R grade cattle, which is the base price reference. He pointed out that this price is currently the EU average but farmers on the ground across this country are being quoted only €3.45 per kilogram today for cattle of grade R3. This is 15 cent per kilogram less than what their representative said on national radio this morning was the EU average and what farmers should currently be getting. The fact is that we need a legal floor to be put in place for the base price for beef. Each week the EU publishes beef carcase prices. The EU average should be used as the benchmark regarding the base price quoted to farmers. This is the very first step needed in bringing about price transparency for cattle. At least farmers could then relate to it. I refer to where a black-and-white figure is provided on the return to the processors across Europe. In light of the distinct lack of information on margins in the processing sector or the farmers' share of the carcase price received on EU markets by processors, including the volumes and values of specific cuts, there is now an urgent need for measures to be taken to provide beef price transparency right across the supply chain. As an interim measure, I suggest that the Minister ask his colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, under section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, to carry out a market study on the nature and scale of consumer and beef farmer issues in the market and make recommendations, as appropriate. People are rightly critical of the commission in the House tonight but there are mechanisms by which it can be used to benefit farmers and consumers and bring about transparency in the beef sector in this country. I ask the Minister to ensure that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, directs the commission to do something for Irish farmers instead of threatening them continually, as has been the case up to now. My research clearly shows that, regardless of what share the farmer is getting for a carcase, in each of the past 15 years the farmers' share for beef produced has reduced by 1.7%. This cannot continue any longer. The tools exist to carry out an investigation. That investigation needs to start before the end of this week. There is a need to consider innovative technology that could help to rebalance the farmers' share for the beef product. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should immediately convene a cross-sector implementation group to establish a publicly owned and controlled national beef supply block chain which has the potential to transform the beef supply chain by reducing production costs and emissions and allowing the farmer to receive a premium return for beef while providing consumers with greater confidence in the beef they consume. If this does not happen, the processors will bring forward the block chain and increase the stranglehold they already have on the industry.

Like the Deputy who has just left the Chamber, I am not a beef farmer. I am not a farmer at all and I do not come from a farming background so I am probably coming at this with a lack of knowledge. I have, however, been a member of the agriculture committee since 2011. I have heard farmers talk about their circumstances at meetings of that committee. I do not remember representatives of the beef companies talking at meetings of the committee at any stage. They are probably the only ones in the sector who have never appeared before it. That is interesting. Nobody has any idea what the beef factories are making or doing. When there is any talk of prices among farmers, there is always deflection from the beef companies. They never seem to have any responsibility at all. This is the crux of the problem. The beef factories get away all the time. One aspect of the crisis that has developed is that there is a focus on the beef factories and purchasers. This is good. Much has been made by farmers about the need to get the representatives of the supermarkets to meetings of the committee so we can talk to them. I was at committee meetings previously at which representatives of the supermarkets were present. There was talk of vegetable prices, for example. Only 10% of Irish beef is sold in supermarkets in Ireland. Therefore, I do not see the purpose of hammering the supermarkets over what they are doing in Ireland. If they increased the price of their beef by 100%, it would mean nothing to beef farmers. That is the reality. Obviously, they are all part of chains. These are selling in England and on the Continent. We might get some insight into how they put pressure on the factories to put pressure on the beef producers to reduce the price but I am sure they will not tell us that at a meeting of the committee, especially in the context of Irish beef producers and the way in which Irish beef is sold. I agree with those who stated that the base price needs to be increased because that is what will make a real difference to farmers. The base price is what they get and everything else is an add-on. What is included in the agreement is all the add-ons. This will make some difference to some farmers but addressing the base price is what will make a difference across the board. We need to have some sort of system with a minimum base price. That is the reality because there is no doubt but that the farmers cannot continue to be squeezed in the way they have been in recent years. EU payments that are lumped in are actually making up their income and selling the beef is basically justifying those payments. That is the way it goes. The only beneficiaries in the long run are the beef factories. They seem to be making large profits. We do not know because they are all privately held and owned. We can only guess what they are doing. That is a real problem in getting to the truth.I agree with all of the other Members who have raised those issues. I agree with Deputy Penrose, who talked about the problems with the beef industry. They have been there for years. I remember local abattoirs, which have been closed for many years now. They all provided competition at the marts. When a farmer went to a mart selling a cow the local abattoirs would bid as well as the beef factories. The marts have all been closed down. In my area of south Donegal, a number have closed. The marts have been closed by stealth. The Department imposed costs on them to force them to get up to speed and then came back a year later to impose further costs. I know of one local abattoir in my area that spent £40,000 - it was pounds at the time - to improve the place and bring it up to standard. It was visited again six months later and hit for another £20,000. How could the standards have changed so much in six months to make that happen? That had the effect of closing the abattoir, which took someone out of the bidding war at every mart taking place in Donegal town. That happened right across the board. There are now only one or two local abattoirs left in the county whereas there were 15 or 20 before. That reduces the number of people bidding to buy the beef when it comes into the mart. That is a problem and results in developments further on.  The situation now is that the beef factories are basically operating a cartel. They are fixing the price and that is the price that farmers have to take. Farmers are quite happy to take it and that is also sad because I believe - and I have had discussions about this previously - that farmers could come together to provide their own killing facilities and market their own beef and lamb. Farmers, however, are of the view that they only grow things and sell them on and that they are not interested in processing or anything like that. If one wants to be sure of getting a genuine price, however, that is what one has to do because the one certainty is that the beef barons, as they are called, are not interested in giving a genuine price for beef. That is what has caused the problem we now have. On the beef plan which the Minister has been discussing and the outcomes of the discussions, he says that "an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal" will be undertaken by the Department. How can the Department know the price composition when the beef producers do not disclose their figures? Will the producers tell the Department what they do? How can the Department stand over figures coming from the producers? I am interested in what the Minister has to say on that.  The reality is that the base price is the issue that will sort this out. If there is to be a resolution to this issue, it will involve the base price. Some way has to be found to ensure such a base price. It is the only way this issue will be solved.

We are all aware that this issue is 20 years in the making. As I have often said, one cannot turn on a light switch and solve everything overnight. In fairness, the farming organisations went in for discussions over the weekend. It was unfortunate that Meat Industry Ireland, MII, would not meet them directly, but in fairness to the Minister and the Secretary General, they tried to hammer out a deal. There are good things in this agreement. From what we have heard in recent days, there may not be enough, but there are good things such as the 8 cent per kilogram bonus for cattle over 30 months, the increased bonus of 20 cent for cattle under 30 months, the review of the 30-month rule, which is needed, and the four-movement rule, which is absolutely crazy. One of these could have been dropped if it had been based on movements because the first person's name would not be put down. The reduction of the residency requirement to 60 days is also welcome. Those measures are positive, as is the index, which will allow farmers to know what is going on in Europe. We need transparency in the whole industry. From my understanding, the staff in the Department provided great help in respect of the purchase organisations, POs, over the past week or ten days. The Minister asked all of the farming organisations to go out and sell the deal. It is therefore very disappointing that tonight - ten minutes ago - I got a call from an individual in one of the farming organisations who went out to sell the Minister's deal, which was agreed by the farming organisations, telling me that one of the factories had sent legal documents and now intends to say that this person was part of a protest as a result of going out to sell the deal on Sunday or Monday night. That is not the spirit of partnership. It is disgusting to think that one of the factories or processors would do this. That information has just come to my attention. There is another issue in solving this problem. I went to a place on Sunday evening and guys came to sell the deal. It was not going down well. The farmers acknowledged that there were good parts in it. People were told to read it again up to last night, when they came back again. The one sticking point at the moment is the base price. Everybody here, including the Minister and me, knows that this is the issue. Whether one is a producer with 500 or 600 cattle or a PO group with sheep, let us not hide from it or duck it. Let us be honest and open. There is between 10 cent and 15 cent to be had from being in a PO. That is how it works, because a PO can supply the commodity that is required. I spoke to some of the sheep groups today. They told me how they operate and what is given. It is sad. If MII recognised the POs, progress could be made overnight. I ask the Minister to go back to MII and talk to Mr. Healy who is doing a lot of shouting on the radio, as was noted earlier. He said €3.60 was available as the base price. That is a lie. The base price given last night and this morning was €3.45. If the producers are giving €3.60, let Mr. Healy come out and confirm that. Otherwise, I ask the Minister to go back to MII and Mr. Healy. Are the producers being stopped from paying this price by certain individuals in the meat industry? This matter can move on. If the POs are recognised by all the meat processors, and the deal that is generally done is agreed, it can be solved. No one is asking for anything over and above that. There is nothing underhand or overhead. This is the way it is done throughout the rest of Europe. Indeed, there is precedent for it in Ireland. This issue can be solved.  There is also anger with regard to Bord Bia and this needs to be addressed. A month ago, one could not sell an animal in the North under the nomadic rule. Cattle are shooting up and down today and Bord Bia gives them quality approval. There is something unusual about that. We also have to look at the protected geographical indication, PGI. As was said earlier, we are in danger of losing 70,000 farms that produce beef. We have 345 feedlots in this country. Should they be given PGI status if the animals are looking out through a barrier for most of their lives? Should we instead recognise the people who are producing animals from grass and give them the premium price they deserve? There are decisions to be made.  Everyone around this country acknowledges that there are many cattle that need to be killed. There are also sheep that need to be killed. People need to reflect on where everything is. When we are talking about jobs, no one talked to the factory workers' unions. The unions sent letters to MII but no one talked to them. The producers simply laid off the staff. A broken-down subcontractor going from one water job to another would keep his or her staff going for a month. The conglomerates should be ashamed of themselves for letting their workers go when one considers the profits they have made. MII has decisions to make. It must tell the various factory owners to engage with the POs and do the deal. That is what it comes down to. This can and must be sorted in a day or two. As Deputy Cahill touched on earlier, we also need to make sure that the export of live cattle is kept up. We have to ensure that we get whatever ingredients or facilities in other countries that we need to do so.It is damning to see Hungarian or Italian beef with a Bord Bia mark on it-----

In the context of the offal business, my next point is not for the Minister. Will he speak to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about lengthening the distances? Under EU legislation, we can go 250 km. Lengthening that might give options when one person controls 70% to 80% of this country's offal business. That situation holds many people to ransom and may not allow them to talk. Whoever made the decision to take the legal route after the Minister had asked people to go to a gate and sell something needs to have a rethink. Mr. Cormac Healy needs to approach his processors and ask them to stand up and be counted once and for all, with less mouthing and more action, and to engage with the POs tomorrow morning on doing what the sheepmeat POs have done and what is being done around Europe. This situation would then be solved in one day.

In recent months, I have spoken to farmers across Laois and Offaly, and I consistently raised the issues concerning beef and suckler farmers a number of times before this crisis kicked off. Some of the farmers I spoke to have never been on a protest before in their lives. This was a case of necessity, with them being forced onto the picket lines in the hope of salvaging their livelihoods and those of the sons and daughters who hope to succeed them in farming. It is a disgrace that the crisis has escalated to this point instead of being resolved. In fairness, the Minister brought the stakeholders to the table, and I commend him on including the representatives of the Independent Farmers of Ireland group. The more stakeholders involved, the better. We need to go back over the situation. Farming families have been put in a desperate and distressing state and have not been rewarded for their produce and hard work of many years. This situation must change if we are to make progress and move forward. Agreement on the base price and total transparency are crucial for the protection and survival of the sector. If we are to build better relations based on trust between the various stakeholders, including the meat industry and Bord Bia, both of which have serious questions to answer, then that is the point at which we must start. Farmers forced onto the picket lines have already stated that they will immediately lift their picket if a fair base price is agreed. Such a price or contract must be agreed urgently in order to allow farmers who want to return to their work to do so, factory employees to return to their jobs and sheep farmers to access the factories. The factories and beef barons have made significant profits while our farmers have made serious losses and have lost all confidence in the meat industry and Bord Bia. This cannot continue. A fair price and respect must be given to our beef and suckler farmers. A fair base price must be agreed. I must point something out to the Minister that came to my attention during the summer. Supports for beef and suckler farmers must be examined. In particular, the criteria for the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, are unfair and require a reduction in herd size. Many farmers who had hoped to enter the scheme could not do so because it stood to lose them more. We need to address this matter. The European Commissioner stated this week or last that it would be an embarrassment if the majority of our beef farmers did not accept the scheme, but the real embarrassment is the fact that the Commissioner has not fought hard enough for Irish farmers over these criteria, removing restrictions and allowing our farmers to enter the scheme. I am mentioning this now because it is an important issue. Farmers on the picket lines have stated that they will immediately withdraw. I hope that they will do so, but the base price issue must be addressed quickly. Seeing our farmers suffering has been shameful. It cannot continue. I call on the processors, who are undoubtedly watching our proceedings tonight, to offer a fair price to farmers and to give them their long-overdue respect in order to save the sector. We must recognise that agriculture has been the backbone of our economy through the bleakest of times. I live in a rural area in which I am surrounded by beef and suckler farmers. I have the utmost respect for the hard work that they do. They deserve it. Farmers have stated that they will in no way agree to anything less than a fair base price. They have drawn a line in the sand. We need that price fast. In addition, I call on the Minister to ensure more supports for farmers in Project Ireland 2040. Will he please increase the direct payment to suckler farmers to €200? It was disappointing to see it at only €40 per cow last year. The €1 billion Brexit fund for market supports and direct aid needs to be implemented in addition to a compensation fund for farmers who supplied cattle post 12 May and are now losing a combined €4 million per week on beef prices. All of these measures would collectively help the farmers.

We stated that we were increasingly concerned at the absence of a beef round-table forum at which grievances and positions could be constructively aired and that would in turn have allowed us to address the long-term challenges facing the beef and suckler sectors. However, it was to be several weeks more before the first talks began. The Government was too slow off the mark. The Minister and his colleagues sat idly by. When the Government finally started talks, it said on a Wednesday that they would be held on the following Monday. This was at a time when the pickets were already at the gates and workers were threatened with losing their jobs. The Government sat idle while Rome burned. Beef farmers told us that they were experiencing significant levels of frustration with the Minister's apparent unwillingness to take a more hands-on approach to the crisis affecting the industry. Like us, the Minister and the Minister of State are rural Deputies. We had all witnessed the unprecedented anger among farmers, yet there was still a delay in getting the talks going. There remains a palpable sense that, despite the agreement reached at the weekend, the situation is not materially better for the majority of farmers. As Deputy Nolan and, quite eloquently, Deputy Fitzmaurice stated, these are historic issues and have been ongoing for more than 30 years. If it walks like a cartel and looks like a cartel, it is a cartel. The fear and ineptitude of successive Governments in tackling this issue have been disgraceful. What of the permanent government? I have no dispute at all with the former Secretary General of the Minister's Department, but he has been appointed as the independent chair. What would have been wrong with appointing Mr. Kieran Mulvey or someone else who was truly independent and with having openness and transparency? In his time as Secretary General, the man to whom I refer was involved in drawing up many of the rules that farmers want removed, for example, the 30-month rule and the four-movement rule. By any yardstick, how could he be classified as independent? It was shambolic, to say the least. Some great work was done in forcing the Beef Plan Movement off the field through threats of injunctions. Then the Independent Farmers of Ireland group came along and the Minister reluctantly allowed it into Agriculture House last weekend. It was treated despicably, I might add. I salute Ms Alison De Vere Hunt from Tipperary, Mr. Ger Gough and Ms Maggie Delahunty. They were left in a room on their own for hours without anyone returning to them. To be treated condescendingly by the assistant secretary was despicable. Today, the Taoiseach dismissed them as if they were not there or talking, but they are there. They are at the gates. They will leave the gates as soon as they get a base price per kilogram. It is as simple as that. As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, the issue can be resolved, but we need that base price. Now there are threats and embarrassment and upset about people in my town of Cahir, where there has been a temporary shutdown and nearly 400 jobs have been displaced, with a further 180 to go. Have these people any loyalty to our workers? I have tried all through this situation to negotiate cattle in and cattle out, meat in and meat out, and for unimpeded access by all kinds of repair and maintenance crews in Cahir. I thank the Garda for its involvement and the protestors for being cordial.Management is trying to bully people such as these. As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, those of us who employ people would not dump them on the road but would keep them on as best we could and find work for them. The companies need to be brought to heel. Cartels have been operating since Charlie Haughey bailed them out. They started at that time and the position has got worse since then. The Minister must get involved immediately and drag these people to talks, including the independent farmers and the representatives of the people who are at the gates of the factories now. We will find a way forward here through talking. That is what we need.

What has happened over the past number of months is a culmination of the frustration that exists among decent people who only want to make a living. Other people are making money from beef but not the people who produce it, stay up late at night with cows calving, buy ration and take animals in during the winter and try to put weight on them and get them ready for the factory. Those people have not been making money. I compliment farmers, young and old, who stood protesting at the factory gates and brought this to boiling point. Their work culminated in the parties sitting down and trying to thrash out an agreement. I am not happy for one minute that this agreement can be welcomed with open arms or will solve all our problems because it will not. I compliment the different groups that have worked on this, including the Beef Plan Movement, the Irish Farmers Association and the United Farmers Association. In County Kerry, Mr. Dermot O'Brien, a man from Firies, has come to the forefront of the Beef Plan Movement.  I was at factory gates and met people who were protesting. I will give one example and it would be no harm to listen because these people are neighbours of ours. I met a female farmer one night, a woman who has given her life to farming. She was making a sacrifice to be at the factory gate. She had buried a daughter only a couple of weeks beforehand and was protesting because, as she said, she had to be there. The Minister should think about that. That woman was there because she felt she had to be. She was a respectable woman who had given her whole life to farming. These are the people to whom the Minister and the people operating the factories should be listening. We cannot have a situation where one or two people can have a cartel and control everything. There are ordinary, decent farmers the length and breadth of Ireland who are the backbone of this country and we should be there to protect them.  I will give an example of the frustration that exists. I received an email a while ago from a man who told me he was writing from a total sense of desperation. He and his wife are small beef farmers and, after two loss-making years, they are fighting for their right to earn a living from their family farm. Both their sons are interested in farming and are pursuing green certificates. Unfortunately, as things stand, the ambitions and work of that man and his wife, as well as the ambitions of their sons, are going down the drain. The beef protests that are ongoing are to try to secure a margin for farmers like that. The email goes on to state what that family wants us, as their public representatives, to do for them. This has happened on the Minister's watch and he was very slow coming out of the traps. Many of us were looking for the Minister and could not find him when we wanted him. It was late in the day when he came out. I do not go backwards; I want to think about going forward. All I want is that our farmers who are producing beef will get fair play and honest pay for what they are producing. They have not been getting it and I am worried they will not get it after this deal. I have concerns about that, as the Minister knows. It is incumbent on every one of us to fight for our farmers. They were the backbone of the country when it went into recession because they were the only people who kept rolling along and always doing their best. We should never forget our farming community. I thank the people who went out and protested because we, as politicians, and the farmers of Ireland, owe them an awful lot.

We have a crisis mainly because successive Governments protected those inside the factory gates. In doing so, they forgot the man and woman on the farm who put in so much work to put meat on the tables of this country. Since 2016 and before, no one listened and now we have a crisis above all proportion and many people are staring ruination in the face. There are 80,000 beef farmers in this country. It is estimated that if any of these farmers goes out of business, it will lead to a loss of €30,000 to his or her rural community which will, in turn, lead to further closures of creameries, shops, pubs and contractors in that rural community. The crisis we have at the factories today could well have been avoided if we had been listened to. Now we are where we are. The Minister has been telling these farmers to go home for the past month. The factories have been telling them to go home or they will take legal action against them. It has been a case of David versus Goliath. Instead of the Minister coming down to factories such as the one in Bandon and talking to these God-fearing, honest farmers, he continued to taunt them. I know that because I have met and spoken to these honest-to-God men and women every day since this peaceful protest began. They are suffering, working at a loss and cannot continue. They cannot pay their contractors because everyone is creaming off the animal the farmers sell but they are getting the least money. The factories are creaming off it and are untouchable. The large retailers are creaming off these farmers and cannot be touched. The Minister was not able to get these people around the table for the past month. The factories called the shots and would not make a serious effort to bring about a successful solution. Instead they have been hiding behind rules and regulations made by successive Governments and put in place to protect them. In doing so, these Governments sold the farmers right down the swanny. The negotiations last weekend could have started at least two weeks ago. The farmers called off the protest outside the factories at that time. There was a lot of talk but the power of the large retailers and factories made sure this would not work. This was a serious breach of trust as far as all the farmers who were protesting outside the gates were concerned. In my view, bilateral discussions were not the way to go about resolving this dispute. Everyone should have been brought around the table. The farming organisations should have gone back to their members on the ground before they accepted the deal that was struck last weekend. Their members outside the factory gates last Sunday night were furious because, under the agreement, we will continue to see farmers making a loss on animals they are selling. The farming organisation should have gone back to its members and discussions should have continued to look at issues such as the 30-month age condition and any other issue that is causing major problems for farmers today.  The base price needs to be increased. This should have been ironed out last weekend and must be dealt with immediately if we are to get solutions for this crisis. The farmers outside the factory in Bandon and every other factory in the country have had enough. They do not trust the factories or the Minister and have told me that. They are not happy with the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Micheál Martin, because of his continued silence on this crisis for Irish farmers. They want this dispute resolved. They are reasonable men and women, as was proved when the Chinese delegation came to Bandon a couple of weeks ago and there was an honest agreement by all protestors to allow them in unhindered. That proved that these are reasonable people but they have been abandoned by successive Governments. Where is the Taoiseach on this issue? He did not listen to us over the past number of years and now we are where we are. It is time for the Minister to wake up and resolve this crisis immediately because these farmers are near the edge and the Minister must protect them.

I went to the ploughing championships today. It was a grand sight on a fine day. I met grand people from all over the country, especially Kerry. Every manufacturer and supplier that was at the championships today is dependent on the farmer. We are at a crossroads. I have raised this issue with the Minister and Taoiseach since early last year and throughout this year. These farmers cannot continue to operate at a loss. The deal that went through in the past few days is not satisfactory because it is not going to affect the base price.As Deputy Fitzmaurice stated, €3.40 or €3.60 is not good enough. The Minister is as good at mathematics as anyone else. It will not work. We looked for different things. The 70-day rule, which was a ministerial or departmental rule, was brought in on foot of BSE. Why can it not be got rid of now? The Minister is shaking his head but it is a fact that BSE is no longer an issue. There is no foot and mouth disease now. I am talking about the 30-month rule. An extra six months would mean that the cattle could be fed in grass and finished in grass and the farmers would get a little bit more out of them, but that is not what is happening. That was not adhered to. On the four-movement rule, if a carcase is hanging in a plant, can any man or woman tell me how many times it has been moved? It is ridiculous, yet if the CAP states that the animal has moved more than four times, the farmer is going to be paying. Like everyone else, I love my bit of land. I bought it 25 years ago. Farmers are trying to stay on their land and continue with their activities but they are not being treated fairly by the factories. I thank all the people who stood at the gates for the past number of weeks in order to highlight the blackguarding of the farmers. They gave of their time unselfishly. I thank the Beef Plan Movement for arranging all the meetings in Cahirciveen, Bantry, Castleisland, Listowel and Kenmare and at all the mart venues throughout County Kerry where farmers came to highlight the situation. They did not go there in the dark winter for fun. They are not being paid fairly, and all they want is a fair price. It is sad that the Taoiseach stated he is doing his bit to reduce carbon emissions by not eating meat. That compounded the despondency among farmers and it is a sad reflection on the Taoiseach. We then had more people suggesting that we should increase our global carbon emissions targets to hurt farmers more. We know that oil is already dear enough and it is to increase because of something that is happening in Iran. When we talk about Iran-----

I thank the Minister for engaging with me on this issue and for speaking to me last week when I contacted him. There is one meat processing factory in Clare, Kepak, which is located just outside Ennis. Effectively, it has the monopoly on beef processing in the county. As has been the case with all other factories across the country, farmers have been protesting outside the Kepak plant for more than two weeks. This is their second time doing so, having already protested earlier in August. Production has stopped, as is the case across the country. That is not in anyone's best interests. The Minister is aware of this. Farmers are fighting for their livelihoods and they are furious about the way they are being treated. They are very angry and that is the reason these protests are continuing. If these protests fail, the viability of rural communities will also fail because farming is the backbone of a community. The agribusinesses that support farming will fail. That will have a knock-on effect on schools and post offices as farmers are driven from the land. Producing beef and being paid at a price below the cost of production is not sustainable. I know the Minister understands that also. That is particularly galling when other players in the meat industry - the processors and the retailers - are making substantial profits. That is not in the best interests of anybody. It is not in the best interests of the processors, even though they might not know it, the factory workers - who are now being laid off - Ireland's reputation, retailers or, ultimately, consumers. The President's remarks at the National Ploughing Championships earlier were evocative. He stated that we must protect those who produce our food and treat them fairly. He stated that they are entitled to a fair share of the fruits of their labour. Family farms are the backbone of Ireland. We have external threats to farming. Brexit is an external threat. Mercosur is an external threat but here we have Meat Industry Ireland, the processors - an internal threat - destroying the viability of rural Ireland. When there is only one purchaser, and effectively we have only one purchaser because there is a conglomerate of beef producers who work collectively, there has to be effective transparency. There has to be structures, which include fair treatment for farmers, to ensure there is proper vigilance. Those are not in place at the moment so we must respect the work that beef farmers do. I have spoken to a beef farmer who takes pride in what he produces. He loads up his cattle on a lorry to go to the processor and he is proud of the work he has put into those animals but he is shocked when he gets his cheque after they are slaughtered because he has done everything required of him. He has been transparent, complied with all the regulations and produced a high-quality animal yet when that animal goes into the processing factory, he gets a cheque which is way below the value of those animals. Farmers are engaging in a physical blockade but the meat processors are engaging in a financial blockade. Effectively, they are driven by profit and there is a lack of both transparency and fair play. In effect, they are the target the Minister should speak to because unless they are forced to produce and pay a price which is equal to the cost of production, the farming community will get nowhere. If they will not do that, then there has to be a full investigation into the activities of the meat processing industry in order to ensure that they are not involved in price fixing, price manipulation or price control and that they are not operating a cartel. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission must look into the activities of the meat industry to ensure that they are not acting in an anti-competitive manner.

It is clear that beef production is fast becoming non-viable. It is obvious that farmers are already upset. It is fair to say they are furious at this stage. While there were significant efforts to resolve the current dispute, particularly over the weekend, the problem is that people are not prepared to work for nothing. It is often stated that the most dangerous people are those who have nothing to lose. We can see today, as the protests continue, that this is the case. Not only are individual farmers affected, we can see the knock-on effects for those working within the sector and the communities in which they live, with in the region of 6,000 workers and their families affected. There is a high degree of uncertainty for that sector in all of this. It is important that we tell the truth about farming-----

The reality is that there is a worldwide glut of beef. That is one of the key reasons beef production has become only marginally profitable in Ireland in recent years. That glut is effectively driving down the base price, even in situations where we are not comparing like with like in terms of quality. Any comprehensive review of where we are needs to consider the system of distributing EU payments, which appears to be inequitable. That has been a criticism over many years. The farmer with the biggest farm gets the largest payments and this has led to the swallowing up of small farms, particularly those producing beef, by larger dairy concerns. It is essential that the position regarding farming subsidies should be reconsidered and that these should, perhaps, form part of a basic payment relating to the maintenance of soil quality on and the diversity of farms.This may give financial security, particularly for small farmers, to consider diversifying from beef. There is a rethink needed on the short, medium and long-term approach. I appreciate that there is a crisis at the moment and it is difficult to get beyond that. A resilient farming sector depends on diversity of production. In Ireland, of all countries, we should know that. It has also been shown by Teagasc that organic beef farming is more profitable than conventional farming. Many consumers are prepared to pay a premium for ethically produced beef. For most people, however, the decision will hinge on how much money they have in their pockets. Support payments are not provided for the horticultural sector, which means it is very difficult for Irish growers to compete against the geoponic polytunnel deserts. Small horticultural ventures need basic supports to buy equipment and build up supply chains.  Brexit goes to the heart of food security. Buying Irish has never been more important given the threats to the agrifood sector and the security of supply lines. Encouraging farmers to "put up or shut up" and stay in an unprofitable business is mad. They will not do so and we should acknowledge that. If prices are controlled by what has been repeatedly described as a cartel of processors, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has an important and immediate role to play. The Taoiseach made the point earlier today that it would be illegal to set the base price for the producer. He cannot have it both ways, however. If the processors are engaged in cartel activity, it needs to be properly investigated and we have an organisation to do such an investigation. This is an opportunity to work with farmers rather than fight them. We need to better support them through diversification and generational renewal. In the context of over-production of beef, the strong negative reaction to the proposed Mercosur deal is completely understandable. It is not just the rearing of capital for the beef sector that needs to be considered. It is the spin-off jobs in rural communities, which in turn drive local economies, that need to be considered. The Mercosur agreement is not just a bottom line exercise where other sectors of the economy are compared. That is without mentioning the unsustainability of the approach taken in terms of climate change and the proximity to markets. In the current dispute, we completely understand why farmers feel the continued need to protest. The best chance of getting a solution is to reconvene talks, while acknowledging, as I do, the serious efforts that have been made, especially at the weekend. When this dispute is considered in the context of the impact it is having, it is clear the Minister must make another effort to get people around the table again to see if there is one last chance of finding a resolution to this. It will not be resolved by people on both sides engaging in a stand-off.

If we do not change our ways, we will see the demise of the family farm and the rise of an industrial farming model that will not serve our people, secure our future or benefit our society. I met a friend the other day who is a farmer in County Kerry. She cited a statistic - I do not know if it is accurate but when I asked her to source it she said it came from Radio Kerry - that no one stands to inherit 60% of farms in Kerry. I believe that figure is probably about right. What are we going to do? The average age of beef farmers is 57 years, which means that in ten years 60% of those farms will become forestry or join a mega-farm.  Visiting the west in the summer, I met a man just on the right side of 50 who said he was the youngest participant on a training scheme for young farmers. I represent Dublin Bay South but I was stopped in the street once last week by a beef farmer and my office also received a phone call from a beef farmer asking what should they do. I did not have an easy answer for them because I am a Deputy for Dublin Bay South. This, however, is my view. We need a national land use plan. Teagasc has fought that suggestion in the Committee on Climate Action when we have argued for it and the Government did not provide for such a plan in the climate report. However, we need to plan what type of farming goes where. We cannot continue to have ABP, Kepak and other companies deciding that. We need a plan to decide what types of forestry and rewilded wilderness should go where. How will we approach our river basin management plans that integrate with all of those issues? Critically, what is the social dimension connected to a land development plan? Will we abandon counties Kerry and Leitrim? I do not think so. We need to change our ways. We need to do a land use plan in conjunction with the new Common Agricultural Policy. My understanding of the EU approach is that it is not a top-down one. It sets the nine objectives, most of which are green and with most of which I agree. It provides that is it is up to member states to decide how to achieve these objectives. We need to stop the current method of paying farmers. I attended the meeting of the committee on agriculture some weeks ago when we discussed the beef issue. The simple truth, which no one disagreed with and which is the nub of this problem, is that we are trading on an Origin Green brand and we are getting an international commodity price, as the Taoiseach said today. That is the problem. Our farmers produce very high quality product compared with other systems, particularly in the area of suckler beef. However, they are getting a lousy price and that has to change. How do we do that? The Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, has suggested the use of protected geographical indicators, whereby Irish beef, particularly suckler cow beef, would be considered special. The Department is looking at this proposal and some of the farm organisations support it. That is one way we could go. If we are to make our products special and be Origin Green, let us be really Origin Green. I am sorry if this is difficult but that will mean no longer having live exports. We cannot tell the Green Party in the German market who would pay the higher premium that we are Origin Green and concerned with animal welfare, while at the same time shipping cattle to Libya and getting a lousy price for them for the farmer.  It will also mean that we will have smaller numbers and will also diversify because we cannot bet everything on international commodity markets. The Minister said that 50% of our beef is minced. We will not get the best price by providing every mince burger in Europe to keep this whole industrial farming going. The Origin Green product is not at the industrial end of production. The beef processor is at the industrial end. The farmers are so small that the power imbalance is significant. We need to change towards a real protected geographical indicator, which is connected to a real change in how we farm, and use all of the skills and quality that exists in Irish farming. Cattle should be grass fed but not in monoculture ryegrass deserts that are pumping our soil full of nitrogen and polluting our rivers and waterways to get as much grass out as possible. I am told by the leading academic experts in grassland management that mixed sward is where the future lies because it is more nutrient-rich and better for the animals' health. There are stronger roots so that when one has a drought one does not have the scorched earth we saw last summer. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will have seen in the south east last year that our grassland systems could not cope. Three times in recent years we have been unable to feed animals here because the grass system failed as a result of climate change. We need to completely change our whole grassland management and move away from the pumped, high input, high cost system we use now which uses high levels of fertiliser that pollute the waters and adopt a much more resilient and biodiverse system that costs less and is based on better nutrients and the protected geographical indicator. Then we will really be the Origin Green country and we will get premium prices. This would also help us. It will not be easy to pay farmers premium prices for genuine Origin Green product but I think we can do so if we really go for it.However, Europe will not give it to us if it is not real and certainly the consumers will not buy if it is not real.  Second, we pay for storing carbon. One of our leading experts from the European Greens who negotiated the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform, made a simple point, namely, that some of our upland grasslands, which would not be the best of grasslands - it would not be comparable to the Golden Vale - would be land where suckler cows graze. He said the best carbon management of that land, marginal grasslands on the hill, is to keep livestock on it grazing, not the big continental breeds but the lighter more indigenous Irish breeds. I have been told the advantage of that is to stop the land reverting to forest, which would drain the land and release the carbon. Rogier Schulte from Teagasc made the case three, four or five year ago when I was talking to him that we need a land use plan because the environmental case and the better case for agriculture go together. It is about time all of us realise that. We need to have a certain humility and to go to the farmers and say we may have the way forward that is better than some of the other political alternatives that have been laughing at us for the past three or four decades and that we are the ones to get them the better price. There is a huge number of skills other than farming skills in the areas of protecting biodiversity, testing water quality to make sure we restore pristine water conditions, educating a new generation of young farmers and paying farmers to do that before all these skills are lost. We need to improve access to land so that everyone feels they have a sense of connection to this. We need to connect farms to local schools. We have started to provide lunches in schools and we could contract farmers, say, six months in advance, advise them we will have a demand for vegetables, potatoes and meat in the local school in six months time and ask them if they can provide that produce. We could ask farmers if they could accommodate school visits to their farms as part of that connection. In the same way we could be connecting local markets. Why is it we only have the English Market in Cork and the Milk Market in Limerick? Why do we not have the same type of market in Dublin, Galway, Waterford and every other town? That is the way we will get over this. By doing that we would be living up to the Origin Green brand and making it all a holistic response. That is the scale of the change and response we need to connect the consumer. We should not forget the consumer in all of this. The consumers are the ones who will set the pace. They will be eating less meat. They will be on planetary diets. It will be a more rare and special thing, something the consumer would pay well for, but we should not be laughing at people if they become vegan or reduce their meat intake. That is their choice. We should not distance the consumer in this. By bringing consumers along with us and involving them in the process we will get the money to pay the farmers properly and rightly.

Mistrust, suspicion, frustration, talk of monopolies and cartels and the most recent desperation of farmers could have been forecast by me and many in this House for a long time. Farmers have been led down a cul de sac and suddenly they realised they need to come back up to the crossroads. The solution to this issue is "transparency", a word that has been mentioned by many in this debate. Having spoken to many farmers and many people employed in the meat factories, many of whom have a deep connection to agriculture, I believe the farmers and the factories need to be friends not foes. During the past 20 years, the word "foe" has become more the norm than that of being friends. The crossroads farmers have reached is a critical point. We could talk about Brexit and the depressed state of beef demand not only in our nearest market in Britain but across Europe, particularly in terms of depressed prices. If we get a hard Brexit the issue of where we are now will have to be reconsidered.  I have a number of questions to which I hope the Minister will respond during the question and answer session. Can he assure farmers categorically that all of the actions and measures agreed in the talks will be stood over and delivered upon? Will he agree to appoint an independent food price regulator, which would bring some transparency? Deputy McConalogue and Fianna Fáil have been asking for that for a long time. Will the Minister commit to this House, as he indicated when I spoke on this issue earlier in the year, that the way forward is forward pricing? It is my belief that that can be achieved. The Minister seemed to indicate it can. Coupled with that, the issue of a base price in good faith needs to be arrived at by the factories. This industry is at a stage of imploding. If things get worse, it will implode further.  I have asked the Minister for Finance about supports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Will the Minister commit to making sure those measures are in place in good time to give further support to the farming sector? It is no good providing them three months after things have imploded.

It has been said that delayed reaction is a big issue that has arisen. My time is limited. I did not expect to be speaking. I will put a question to the Minister. Would it be wise to suggest that Meat Industry Ireland, MII, send representatives to each unit factory plant to get the management and the boys at the gates to talk? There are no proper talks going on among the various local plants. Following the Minister’s deliberations on Sunday evening, when everyone thought a resolution had been found, it was said that people should go back and talk to the individual plants, be it in Charleville, Bandon or, in my case, Watergrasshill. However, nothing is happening at the moment in regard to discussions. Would it be possible for MII representatives to get out of Dublin, go down to the plants, go into the yards and meet the farmers to see if they can thrash out the local prices? How anyone can come out of a meeting, and perhaps the farmers are at fault for this, without coming up with some kind of gentleman’s agreement on the base price I will never know. I know the Minister cannot give the base price but there must be something in the room that would give an indication of where the base price would come from. That is where the issue has arisen. Fair dues to all those involved. They covered bonuses, incentives, the 30-month rule and the 36-month rule. All that is grand but it is no good until we know on top of what that is being paid. I hope to speak tomorrow night on our motion on this issue. The Minister has done good work on the issue but we urgently need to get results. That key point is what is happening at the moment. Every farmer would pay the price if there was a divide and conquer approach. If there were no beef producers there would be nobody to buy the calves from the dairy farmers and nobody to buy feed from the tillage farmers.

What is wrong when a sector is full of part-time farmers who must subsidise their income with income from off-farm jobs and EU payments and who still lose money year after year and yet the larger companies profit endlessly? Why is Bord Bia adopting a policy of Origin Green that in the event of a hard Brexit would favour processors, compared with live exports, that will avail of a lower tariff when for years in the past live exports to the UK were effectively prohibited by nomad cattle designation? The closure of Irish meat plants is deliberately being done as part of the processors' Brexit exit strategy. To follow up on what Deputy O'Keeffe has said, could the Minister engage with the MII - I am not seeking new discussions - to get its members to recognise the new and the only beef producers organisations that are in place so as to put trust and faith back into the sector? That has been lost. If the Minister was to make that call to encourage it to meet with the new organisation, we could help move people away from picket lines.

As outlined, much of what was in the motion we tabled in the summer seems to be filtering through in the solution that was proposed earlier.Among farmers, there is a great distrust. They are at a low ebb and see no future in it. Can the Minister recognise why they would feel that way having seen, for example, the €100 million beef scheme being changed before and after the council election? Can the Minister recognise the difficulty and the mistrust when they see their future, lifestyle and income slipping away? Is the Minister satisfied this plan will be the real starting point and where does he envisage a finished, improved point in this regard?

It undoubtedly was time for the Minister to have meetings and maybe they should have been held much sooner. We learned that Meat Industry Ireland representatives did not go into the room with the farming organisations. Quite honestly, it is an insult to the genuine people, including the Minister, who were there at a meeting that they did not think it worth their while to go into the room, sit down in front of these people, face them and answer questions. It is a disgrace. Of course, it is all about base price. While it is great to see the incentives, Meat Industry Ireland has stated that the price of beef was €3.60 per kilogram, but we heard today in the Dáil Chamber that the base price is €3.45 per kilogram. How can people have confidence or faith in a system? We are talking about this 8% increase, and increases of 12 cent and 20 cent. The people are not being treated fairly. The decent thing for Meat Industry Ireland to do would have been to go into the room with those people, sit down in front of them and have a good debate.

On the latter point, it is unfair to characterise the structure of the talks as any indication of an unwillingness of either party to engage with each other. They were conducted in a suite of offices. They were a series of bilateral meetings. There was no stated reluctance whatsoever on behalf of MII to engage but it was felt the best way, in the context of eight different parties to the talks, to structure it. That should not be misinterpreted as any reflection on the indication. In fact, there was goodwill on all sides from the commencement of the talks. That was reflected in the fact that eight different parties to the talks achieved a consensus at the end of it. Deputy Rabbitte referred to the low-income sector. In terms of public policy, we have long moved from supporting product prices to supporting income and that is why the €100 million, to which Deputy Aindrias Moynihan alluded, is the response. The €100 million did not change in terms of its terms and conditions. The €100 million was announced and the conditionality attached to it. That is reflective of previous experience in that regard. On the dairy side, when there is an issue in the market of oversupply there is a conditionality attached to it of supply reduction. I have commented previously about the toxic relationship. I believe this plan represents the best chance of a new beginning. It entails compromises by everybody but I believe with goodwill on all sides, it can work. People have spoken at length tonight about the base price and the inadequacy of the talks in that context. It simply is not legally possible to talk about base price. The commentary here tonight on the variations in the base price was interesting. Some spoke of a base price of €3.45 per kilogram while others spoke of a base price of €3.60 per kilogram. It surely goes to show there is competition in the marketplace on base price. In terms of building relationships, that is something on which at local management level there should be better engagement. I have commented on that previously. This is, like all negotiations, a compromise. It represents the best chance for a roadmap to go forward.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	377	What has been discussed here in the past couple of hours reflects the position and the difficulties in the industry. We are all united in the view that the industry needs to be saved. It needs to be improved. We need to build trust and we need to try to make it sustainable for everyone. If it is not sustainable for the primary producer, as the Minister and the Minister of State will be aware, the show is over. We must all work to that end. In the talks, I acknowledge that some progress was made. One can see that set out in the plan, in what is reported and in what has been revealed to us over the past couple of days. However, we can see it does not go far enough and the only place that will be settled is in further talks. Would the Minister agree to reconvene talks if that is clear across the sector? The factories are desperate for a solution. The farmers are desperate for a solution. As their political representatives, we want to see a solution. If there is a willingness on both sides, is the Minister willing to reconvene talks? I ask these questions in the context of trying to come at it with solutions because we can come in and vent anger and everything like that but we must try to find solutions. I am not saying the Bill I brought forward is perfect but its aim is to try to get going the idea of legal underpinning of the price reporting. My party welcomes the fact that price reporting is built into what was agreed in the talks. That is a positive step forward. Can such price reporting be legally underpinned? One would not be setting prices. One would be stating that there was a computerised system where the factories would have to comply and feed in information daily, for example, on what price they were giving, for what bulk of cattle and for what grade. It is straightforward. Would the Minister and the Minister of State agree that is something we could consider as an option to try to achieve a solution to the trust issue? How many times has the word "trust" been mentioned here tonight? It is a real issue and I recognise that. The simple fact is that the farm organisations that were at the talks went back to the picket lines but were not able to bring those picketing with them. The people in the room did their best but they were not able to sell it. They were not able to sell it because the farmers do not see it as stacking up economically for them. Does the Minister recognise it needs further negotiations and further movement? Lastly, is the Minister concerned about the situation that I outlined regarding the offal industry, where nearly all of it is controlled by one major player, because that leads to a most dangerous situation in terms of distorting the market?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	378	I thank Deputy Stanley. On the Deputy's point that participants have been unable to sell the deal and that talks should be reconvened, I do not believe that to be the case. My Department and I have been facilitators of the dialogue on both occasions, in Backweston and, more recently, in Agriculture House last weekend. The fact that seven different farm organisations - the IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the ICMSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Beef Plan Movement, Macra na Feirme and the Independent Farmers of Ireland - after long negotiations were in a position to put their hand up, state they supported this deal and would recommend it to the picket line is a significant statement of itself that here one has the collective negotiating power of the farming community. Unless we become bound to the last man standing on the picket, this represents the best negotiated way forward. There are obligations on both sides. There is a quid pro quo in terms of the legal proceedings. The way forward is through getting this deal over the line now. I urge people to read it and to give it serious consideration. Time is of the essence. Real, serious irreversible damage is now being done to the industry and I urge everybody involved to consider it. On Deputy Stanley's Bill, one of the commitments in the agreement is to look at best practice in transparency models internationally. The model which Deputy Stanley has advanced is similar in detail to Part 59 of the US code of regulations but we will look at all models and codes. That is one of the commitments.That code that he has produced works in a wholesale market in the US. The model in Europe is very different, with third country exports and different circumstances. We look at best practice internationally to see what might be done. Indeed, it is not the case that one operator controls the offal sector here. That is the purpose of having a beef market task force. It will be able to set its own agenda to examine the issues. There is equipment to examine a number of the issues that have been raised as alleged anti-competitive practices in the deal. The task force will be able to investigate and take next steps as it sees appropriate.

We know the Minister is not going to agree with that. I want to ask him about the Government's policy of providing State assistance to the beef industry in the event of a major crisis flowing from Brexit. Does he believe there would need to be guarantees from the industry on the defence of all jobs before money would be handed over? Is he in favour of handing over the money in the hope that the industry preserves the jobs? Are there conditions attaching such that there would be no wage cuts or job losses in order for money to be handed over? It is not the policy I support; I support taking the industry into public ownership. However, I am asking the Minister a specific question about the Government's policy on handing over that money.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	380	Various ownership models have been at play. The co-operative model has previously applied in the meat industry, although now it is entirely privatised. Perhaps it is an issue for consideration and one that farmers and farm organisations could examine to add further competitive pressures to the market in Ireland. I do not see a role for State ownership but there was previous experience of co-operative ownership in the processing sector and it is something that farmers and their representative organisations might wish to revisit. There are plants allegedly for sale. We are led to believe also some plants may not reopen because of the difficulty. There are opportunities there. The Deputy made a point about the Brexit supports that may be necessary. The industry needs a functioning meat processing sector. No party to the dispute has any beef with that assertion. The supports that are available are provided through various State agencies. In the context of Brexit, it is widely recognised that the agrifood sector will be the most exposed. The UK market accounts for approximately 300,000 tonnes of our exports or more than 50%, with the figures reducing somewhat this year because of market pressures in the UK, exchange rate issues, etc. We have given a commitment that the required levels of support will be available to keep the agrifood sector in a position to navigate the short or medium-term challenges it may face if there is a crash-out Brexit. The exact detail of that has yet to be worked out in the context of any individual industry.

There is talk about €3.40 per kg and I was talking to somebody since I left the Minister who was offered €3.25 a fortnight ago. They cannot survive on €3.25, €3.40 or €3.60; that is a fact. We need €3.80 or €4. That is it. Why can they not accept less profit? A farmer told me one plant made €190 million and asked would €90 million not do it fine for a year. Farmers are making nothing.

There are the issues of 30 months, the control of the offal and many others that these farmers are concerned about. However, to give us any hope of an immediate solution, the Minister needs to put pressure on to raise the base price. If this is done for a period, it could well trigger an end to the protest. Is this possible? We want to bring an end to the protest. Farmers are angered and hurt by comments being made by everybody. We are not going to point any more fingers here. We are just trying to find a solution and a way forward. A serious and fair increase to the base price could trigger an end to this protest.

The Minister might clarify what that means. It was also stated that there would be an immediate scientific review of the quality payment grid by Teagasc. He might also comment on that, as well as the establishment of a beef meat task force. He might outline what they mean to the farming community.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	384	I have made it abundantly clear, as have all of those who were party to the negotiations, that it is not legally possible to discuss fixing a base price; that is contrary to competition law. One of the leading organisations at the heart of this problem has officially communicated to us that it recognises that base price cannot be part of the negotiations. It has been to the forefront in establishing producer organisations, which it recognises as the vehicle through which talks on base price can be progressed. Deputy Penrose is dead right in the context of producer organisations. They thrive on the loyalty of those who are members, not to be peeled off individually by sweetheart deals. The strength comes in numbers in negotiating specification, in forward pricing, input costs and so on. They can deliver in so many ways for farmers and we have one up and running. It is a credit to those who seized that initiative. They are part of the landscape in most other European countries, where farmers come together. They address the issue that they are price-takers as individuals and group together to negotiate on the basis that "we will provide you with what you want but you must share the risk with us." That is how base prices are addressed and improved. The bonus structure is on top of that. I encourage farmers to take up that issue. I do not know the figures the Deputy is talking about. They sound wide of the mark but I am not going to comment on them. Producer organisations will enable farmers to get a fairer share of the returns. Deputy Harty asked about the commitment in page 1 of the agreement to the establishment of a beef market price index. This will operate in the same way as Ornua's purchase price index, PPI, for the dairy sector. Its gives an idea of the international benchmark in any given week for the price of the product. Farmers can use that to compare the price being paid here with the average European price. It will probably be based on the top six or seven markets to which we export, including the returns and the volume going into each of those markets. It should also be able to factor in offal prices abroad and indicate what they should be to the primary producer here. It will be another instrument to bring greater transparency to the price model and it is a welcome development. The task force that is being established is to oversee the provisions of the agreement but also, in a number of areas where there is contention or where there are to be further studies, to take on board the outcome of the studies and what next steps may be taken.The task force will comprise all the stakeholders. It will be independently chaired. All of this is contingent on getting this deal over the line. There are things that can be delivered immediately and they have been front-loaded in terms of the first page of the agreement. There are other issues where there is a difference of opinion and there are commitments to have those matters investigated. I refer to alleged anti-competitiveness practices, greater price transparency, directors and a regulator for the sector. They are all things the task force will oversee and drive and it will set its own agenda because the agenda will change as well. That is what the task force is about. The review of the grid is a source of contention. The grid is not the property or the invention of the Department. It is a formula for paying that was negotiated between the processors and farm organisations some years ago and it is overdue a review.

The first is a question on protected geographical indication, PGI. Does the Minister have any update for the House on whether there are any discussions with the European Commission or with the authorities? What is his projected timeline? Does he think it would be applied to a certain category of beef farmers or to all? The second question relates to the land use plan. We had a discussion on the issue during Question Time with the Minister. Everyone I meet on the academic and policy side says that it is correct to say that we need a land use plan, such is the scale and complexity of the challenge and the interaction between environmental objectives, social objectives and economic objectives that one cannot map where we are going from here unless we have a proper land use plan. Third, the Minister opened up the organic scheme but I understand it was closed again. Could he give an indication of the demand from beef farmers for entry into the scheme? Does it provide a path for the future, as the farmers in Austria seem to have mastered, whereby they get a high price for a significant percentage of organic dairy and beef produce? Last but not least, I did not raise it in my speech but in the context of base prices and commodity markets, does the Department have any analysis of the development of artificial beef, in other words, hamburgers made in a lab? The Minister is smiling but from what I am told people say this is game over for the beef industry anyway because of that potential development. I do not know if there is any awareness or recognition that it is coming, pretty much with certainty. If we are not aware of that as a potential input to the debate on the price of beef then we are missing a trick.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	388	On the latter point, the pace of scientific advance is quite staggering in that area. One of the great strengths of our offering on the international stage is the natural product that we produce in a sustainable way in a grass-based production system. While we must be cognisant of all consumer trends and scientific advances, I do not think we should in any way dilute the merit of the offering we have. It is a ferociously competitive market out there. In the context of Deputy Ryan’s other question on the PGI status, there is ongoing engagement between my Department and the Commission on having PGI approval for the grass-based, suckler offering we make in the beef sector. We are trying to progress that as quickly as possible at a European Union level to give us a niche branded offering, because we must move away from the bargain-basement commodity in terms of beef production. That is what everything we have been doing for many years has been driven by in terms of producing beef to a higher specification and, as the Deputy said, not disrespecting the consumer but responding to consumer trends. Looking for a grass-based, natural, Origin Green product is a critical part of our offering. That is based on the feedback and analysis that has been done by Bord Bia, which does a tremendous, professional job. It is highly regrettable that Bord Bia has been targeted in a most unfair way for abuse and criticism, in particular today at the ploughing championships. Bord Bia does a tremendous job all over the world promoting and working with Irish farmers and the processing sector to advance the best interests of all of us. In terms of a land-use plan, I am not in favour of a prescriptive approach that says there should be trees in the west, dairy production in the Golden Vale and tillage in the south east. Every area has an obligation to carry its share of the responsibility in terms of efficient production and maximum sequestration. I do not think it is fair to ask something of a particular sector of society or to say to a geographic area of the country that this is the only place for trees. That has bedevilled the afforestation programme-----

It was identified that there was scope for expansion in the dairy and arable sectors. The organic scheme for beef was well subscribed but there was a deficit in organic grains for supplementary feed to finish animals. The feed was too expensive which meant that some beef and only 32% of lamb born to organic standards was being sold as organic because it was not economically viable. There was also great demand for milk products and by-products from the Little Milk Company, Glenisk and others. The scheme was weighted in favour of the dairy and arable tillage sectors specifically at the request of the focus group. We implemented its recommendations and we reopened the scheme. There will be a review of the scheme post 2020. When my predecessor, Trevor Sargent, a former colleague of Deputy Eamon Ryan, was in the Department 12 years ago he set a goal to drive forward organic production, which was at 1%. We are now at 2% and growing, so the scheme has worked and is working and it has potential.

I thank not alone those who spoke but all Oireachtas Members of my party, all parties and none with whom I engaged intensively in the past several weeks in an effort to make progress on the issue. I appreciate the bona fides, wisdom and assistance that was freely given and the advice that was offered. I like to think the agreement we reached was informed by that spirit of co-operation and generosity. There is a recognition that this is an issue that is above party politics, which has polarised the farming community, and there is a requirement to find a solution to it. To those who have been involved in the pickets, I say that they have made their point. They have probably made it more forcibly than anybody in my memory has made a point about how disaffected, alienated, excluded and disappointed they feel.There comes a time, however, when protest has to end and we have to resume normal business. I believe it is the distilled view of most Members of this House that we would earnestly appeal to them on that basis to say the time has come to stop. They have made their point. They have made it eloquently and passionately, and I know they are invested emotionally in the cause they have given so much to over recent weeks. I fear we have reached a tipping point in this protest, where its continuation now serves to do irreparable and irreversible damage to the industry that we all profess to want to serve. We live by our reputation in the international market. We have a good reputation and it has been enhanced by those farmers and the quality of the product they produce. It has been enhanced by those like Bord Bia which, on the international stage, is as good as any body I have seen and probably the best at what it does in terms of the global reach and the professionalism it brings to giving us a reputation in those international markets, which many would seek to displace us from. The international marketplace is very competitive, and it is particularly so in beef because it is oversupplied. In the markets we are predominantly reliant on, we are looking at consumption that is flatlining and consumption patterns that are changing, as Deputy Ryan alluded to. The newer markets, where there is potential, are probably not yet as financially rewarding as the more mature markets we are in. As I said, we are now at a stage where our reputation is in some jeopardy and others are only watching to take our market share. I appeal to those who have made their protest eloquently to consider that the time to stop is now. It is indicative and worth reflecting on that seven farm organisations of different hue, view, motivation, background and membership came together and collectively, in very intensive negotiations, reached a conclusion. It takes some bravery to negotiate and to acknowledge that one cannot get in negotiations everything one wants, and to compromise. It is significant that seven organisations that came to the table approved the deal that was concluded. I acknowledge the nuanced approach of the Independent Farmers of Ireland and that, on the day, they said they would have difficulty with it. However, all seven did put their hands up to commit to sell this deal to the farmers on the picket line. It is worth reflecting on the significance of that alone because, as all of us collectively know, they are not easily pushed over. Farm organisations are probably among the most effective lobbyists and campaigners. When they recognise that what is on the table is the best that is on offer now, but that there is also within the agreement a roadmap to address other issues of contention, that is worth reflecting on. One of the very positive things that has come out of all this, and I think it will be a lasting legacy, is producer organisations. We have been on a roadshow around the country for more than two years and have approved various facilitators, but I take my hat off to the people who seized the opportunity and who now recognise that the way to progress the partnership that should be at the heart of this industry is through producer organisations. I would say to farmers to seize the opportunity. There is plenty of room for more than one producer organisation. When people control significant numbers of cattle through a producer organisation, they have leverage in those negotiations, they can negotiate price and specification, and they can share risk and plan with greater certainty. I acknowledge the endeavours of those who took the initiative to establish it and, indeed, to the officials in my Department who have been recognised by the producer organisations as having been very helpful. While I acknowledge all of the people who contributed and their bona fides, this is the critical time. Collectively, I believe it is time to call a halt to the protests. I appeal to them. I have had engagement personally with protesters from west Clare, west Cork, Kildare and the south east, and I have met them in Carlow, as well as through the engagement with all of my Oireachtas colleagues and others on all sides. While I do not want to mention names, some were especially helpful and insightful, and a bridgehead to the picket lines. All of us in the House have a good understanding of the issues. I believe the deal represents the best way forward to deal with those.

Ní mór dom a rá ar dtús, cé nach maith liom a bheith diúltach, go gcuireann sé díomá orm go bhfuil leasuithe curtha síos ag an Rialtas mar tá an rún atá agam chomh bunúsach. Táim ag impí ar an Rialtas polasaí a fhorbairt ó thaobh na n-oileán atá ann agus spriocdháta a chur leis an bpolasaí sin. Níor rith sé liom go mbeidh athruithe nó leasuithe i gceist mar tá an rún chomh bunúsach sin. I am tabling this motion to implore the Government to develop as soon as possible a policy for the islands. I was hoping to hear that the Government was genuine and in earnest about the urgent need to develop and publish such a policy for offshore islands, and I wanted to start off with a positive plan. When I read the amendment, however, I have to say it really knocked me back. My motion is very straightforward. It sets out the historical background to the lack of a policy, and then it simply goes on to call on the Government to publish the policy within a timeframe and to ensure the inclusion of representatives from the island community. It is as simple as that. I would like to be a lot more radical but I went for what I thought would be a consensus motion, so this is a matter of disappointment to me. That policy needs to be accompanied by an action plan and a budget, and it must be underpinned by legislation if we are serious about our islands and maintaining a viable island community. Moreover, the forum which allows for such a policy, plan or legislation to emerge must be one which allows for the involvement of islanders from the outset and on an ongoing basis in the formulation and implementation of the policy and action plan. In that context, I gave a cautious welcome to the announcement by the Minister of State back in July, but that welcome, I am afraid, has now gone. I gave a cautious welcome because it was the Minister of State's intention to seek Cabinet or Government approval to set up an interdepartmental committee for island development with a view to developing a cross-Government island policy and an associated action plan. As the Minister knows well, however, the path to hell is paved with good intentions and also with reports, including an interdepartmental report from 1996, to which I will return, which was completed without the involvement of the islanders themselves. All of these reports have gathered dust on various departmental shelves. Indeed, the Minister's own statement was notable for its vagueness, its lack of timeframes and its utter failure to recognise that the islanders themselves must be an integral part of any process proposed.The vagueness of the statement, which involved the setting up of an interdepartmental committee, along with the silence that has prevailed until tonight, has done little to inspire confidence that the Government has listened and learned from past mistakes. The Minister of State will be aware from repeated and urgent representations from the islanders themselves and from Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann that the vacuum created by the absence of a policy on the islands has been detrimental to the viability of the island communities. The motion itself, which I will not go into because it is there in black and white, sets out the damning statistics, which are still emerging from the Central Statistics Office following the census of 2016. This is in stark contrast to the islands of Scotland, which have seen a reversal in the trend of population decline. The most recent trend has in fact been an increase in population. A report in one newspaper showed that the population of the islands increased by some 4% in the ten years up to 2011, with the biggest rises occurring on the island with the largest population already. That report showed that island leaders and business leaders said new affordable housing and new opportunities were the ways of holding on to islanders and drawing in non-islanders. This reversal in the population's downward trend is premised on a policy for the islands and on legislation, most notably the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, passed in May 2018. We have no policy or legislation. Significantly, that Act sets out key definitions of an island and of an inhabited island. The definition of the former is stated as an island "surrounded on all sides by the sea (ignoring artificial structures such as bridges)". I will come back to that in the context of an island policy and the meaning of island communities. Equally importantly, that Act, in Part 3, provides for the preparation of a national islands plan. It provides for, among many other things, an islands community impact assessment, including having regard - can one imagine? - to a request for a retrospective island community impact assessment. The Act allows for even a retrospective impact assessment. There must be an annual review of the operation of the legislation and a full review of the actual legislation within five years. That is on top of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise, formerly the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which was set up in 1965. There is absolutely no Irish equivalent to this. Contrast this with what can best be described as the ad hoc approach of this Government and successive Governments to the development of the islands here. In preparing for this debate I read quite a number of documents, including: the report of the interdepartmental committee, published in 1996; the joint Oireachtas report of 2014; the review of islands capital expenditure, 1998-2004; the west Cork islands study, which was a joint study between Cork County Council and FÁS and which was subsequently referred to in the 1996 report as being a very worthwhile study with many good recommendations that should be taken on board, but which were clearly ignored; and the most recent book by the renowned historian, Professor Diarmaid Ferriter, entitled On the Edge: Ireland's Off-shore Islands: A Modern History. I thank the Oireachtas Library as well for its papers. All these documents helped me to get a deeper understanding of the islands on top of my own practical experience. No words came to me when I thought, "We have no policy for our islands." What jumps out from all the documents and the books cited is the resilience of our islanders in the face of repeated and ongoing neglect by successive Governments. All the while, ironically, this neglect and the complete absence of a positive policy for our islands have been accompanied by report after report, some of which I have mentioned, which, one way or another, have sought to recognise "the special economic, social and cultural contributions which the offshore islands make to the life of the nation". Those precise words are taken from the 1996 report, almost 23 years ago, of the last interdepartmental committee, which sat for three years prior to publication. If we look at page 18 of the interdepartmental report, we really could not improve on it. It is worth reading out because some of the words in the Minister of State's amendment to my motion are taken from it. It states that in developing Government policy to address issues affecting island communities, a number of principles should underline any policy. I do not have the time to read them all out. I will pick out some of them.- Islanders themselves should be prime movers in strategies to maintain their own communities;- Principles of equality, social partnership and full participation should underpin the State's approach to developing public policy in relation to island communities;- A partnership approach between island communities and State Agencies should be adopted in the development and implementation of policy affecting the islands.Page 18 is really worth looking at. Notwithstanding these wonderful principles, the ad hoc, reactive approach to the constant challenges faced by our island communities continued and continues. The islands are spoken about peripherally and are never at the heart of any Government discussion, policy document or legislation. The national planning framework, known as Project Ireland, published with great fanfare and at great cost, and the National Development Plan 2018-2027 which accompanies it, are a stark example of this continued neglect. Looking through both these documents for instances of the word "island", it is shocking and frightening. They are peripheral, difficult to find and mixed up with a policy for rural areas. I searched and searched to see whether I could find anything that would resemble a policy or a paragraph; I failed. The national development plan refers to the money given to the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands, so we have mention of islands there. Later on it refers to development of improved peer infrastructure on the islands but nothing about a policy. In the national planning framework islands are mentioned in three contexts. "Our islands and coastal areas contain some of our most vibrant and culturally distinctive communities." No absence of words here to tell us how important our islands are, but no action. They are mentioned peripherally in the contexts of broadband and a marine economy. Moving from those documents to the reality on the ground, I will look at my own constituency, at the risk of being parochial. I know my colleagues will cover Cork, Donegal and other areas. Inishbofin, off the coast of Galway, with which the Minister of State is very familiar, is an island that has distinguished itself by surviving with a vibrant community in the absence of any policy. The islanders have led the way in ecotourism, and the island is the first to get the distinction of Leave No Trace, an outdoor ethics programme based on seven principles for outdoor recreation, leaving minimal impact on the island's environment. It is also leading the way in dark skies, food and many other sustainable industries. However, year after year at the comhdháil, the annual meeting, they point out the absence of certainty of funding and the absence of a policy. The Minister of State knows that this island does not even have a primary care centre that one could call a primary care centre. My colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is virtually not here, and I have asked repeatedly about the promised primary care facility. I accept that work has been done on all the islands. My point is that it has been done in an ad hoc, reactive fashion and not within a policy that shows that not alone do we cherish our islands, but we recognise that the islands are showing us the way to live sustainably. If we had any sense or courage, we would listen to and follow them. Looking at the Aran Islands, despite the policy for the Gaeltacht maidir le cúrsaí oideachais, agus is iontach go bhfuil an tAire i gcomhluadar ansin, in ainneoin go bhfuil aitheantas faighte ag Coláiste Naomh Eoin, Inis Meáin, a bhfuil mar scoil neamhspleách anois, agus Coláiste Ghobnait, Inis Oírr, tá siad ag streachailt agus ní bhfuair siad an dara múinteoir fós.Ní thuigim é sin mar tá moladh tuillte ag an Rialtas ó thaobh an pholasaí do na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht de, ach cad mar gheall ar an bpolasaí a chur i bhfeidhm? Cén fáth go bhfuil na scoileanna sin ag streachailt de bharr múinteoirí breise? Tagraím d'fhorbairt na cé ar Inis Oírr. Bainfidh mé úsáid as na focail a d'úsáid muintir Inis Oírr:Tá forbairt cé Inis Oírr práinneach mar gheall ar an gceist contúirteach a bhaineann le tonnta loinge a sháraíonn an ché ar thaobh amháin agus an ghaoth anoir aduaidh ag crochadh borradh agus ag cur farraige thimpeall na cé ar an taobh eile, go minic ag an am céanna.

Like her, I am disappointed with the amendment and I ask the Government to withdraw it, not push it to a vote, and to accept and work on her motion by setting a date in September to set up a committee. As a city dweller, I only have limited knowledge of what it is like to live on one of our offshore islands. However, I saw a report on television yesterday on a trial to use drones to deliver vital medical supplies when bad weather makes it impossible to access an island. That brings home that the particular issues and needs of island communities. That is why it is essential that there be representatives from the islands on the interdepartmental committee. There should be people who live on the islands and know the issues and the needs of their communities. This is a perfectly reasonable demand from a community that has been continuously ignored. There is a problem with not having community representatives on an interdepartmental committee. Why not change the format to allow representatives on a task force that has the legislative power and funding to implement a policy and follow it through with an action plan? There is currently no policy for the islands and that is a threat to the future of these communities. Between 2011 and 2016, there was a 5.4% decline in their population and a decline in Irish usage as a daily active language. The Minister should be especially concerned about that, since he went a long way to try to re-educate himself on the language for his brief. The 1996 report of the interdepartmental committee did not include island representatives, which is a key factor in that report's recommendations not being delivered on. A key demand of these communities is recognition of our offshore islands as a region, which would allow access to specific EU funding and programmes for island regions. In 2018, Scotland passed an Act to recognise its islands as a region. One consequence of that has been an increase in their population. The motion seeks to address housing, health and schools. It is incredible and discriminatory that the special DEIS grant for pupils learning through Irish is denied to all five island post-primary schools, which are multidenominational. In contrast, that grant is paid to voluntary all-Irish schools run by Catholic religious orders, often in quite affluent areas. That is a stark reality for the islands and it is a disgrace. An issue raised in the motion that caught my attention is energy and climate change. The islands offer a unique opportunity as a model for community-based co-operatives to develop renewable energy. This could be a model for smaller rural communities and deal with concerns and opposition to developer-led windfarms. I commend the motion to the House and ask the Minister not to move Fine Gael's amendment.

Tuigim go maith gur cuid thábhachtach d'oidhreacht an Stáit iad na hoileáin mhara. The islands and their communities represent a dynamic resource in a developing Ireland, embodying an extraordinary repository of language, culture and heritage and constituting a unique element in the fabric of society. A key objective of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is to provide support to ensure the social, cultural and economic development of the inhabited offshore islands and thereby ensure that they survive as viable communities. Population decline in the islands is similarly reflected by demographic trends in many parts of rural Ireland with young people moving to large cities to experience greater economic opportunities and city lifestyle. The Government, through the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, has put in place a range of measures to support island communities. In 1996, there were just three passenger ferry services, one cargo and an air service route in receipt of financial assistance from the State. The total cost at the time to the State for these subsidies amounted to just £893,910. In contrast, by 2018, the State subsidised 14 passenger ferry routes, nine cargo routes and two air services. The total cost of these services amounted to more than €6.5 million. The increased investment by the State in these services has supported the sustainability of the island communities by underpinning critical access for island life all year round. In 2018 alone, this support translated into 500,000 passengers and more than 27,000 tonnes of freight being carried on services subsidised by the Department. Government, in conjunction with local authorities, has also provided support for the development of harbours, which help to provide safe year-round access to the islands. An annual programme of island road and other small capital projects has also been in place for more than 20 years, which has enabled the development and maintenance of island infrastructure. To date, more than €100 million in funding has been provided towards completion of harbour infrastructure for the islands. Three major harbour projects have been included in Project Ireland 2040, namely, improvement works to piers on Inis Oírr, Inis Meáin agus ag Machaire Rabhartaigh, serving Toraí agus an bád farantóireachta sa phlean fosta go dtí Toraí. Tugann an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta aitheantas faoin tábhacht cultúir fadúda an teanga Ghaeilge, ní hamháin ar an mórthír ach ar na hoileáin uilig fosta. Faoin bpróiseas pleanála teanga, tugtar deis do phobal na Gaeltachta fá choinne an phleanáil teanga a ullmhú agus a chur i bhfeidhm ar leibhéal an phobail agus tacaíocht a bhaint amach as an Stát fá choinne an teanga a úsáid sa phobal uilig agus an teanga a neartú. Tá tacaíocht de suas chuig €100,000 ar fáil fá choinne achan plean agus beidh suas chuig €150,000 ar fáil ar na trí oileán Árann. Beidh na pleananna éagsúla á gcur i bhfeidhm trasna seacht mbliana. Chomh maith leis sin, fuair Údarás na Gaeltachta aitheantas breise i mbliana fá choinne chultúr agus fhorbairt pobail sa Ghaeltacht. Is é an méid iomlán atá i gceist ná €3.85 milliún. Tá an cuidiú sin fá choinne na ndreamanna éagsúla ar na hoileáin uilig agus rinne mise cinneadh mar Aire Stáit i 2015 fá choinne na hoileáin gan stádas Gaeltachta. Bhog an dualgas sin go dtí an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. I ndiaidh sin, bhí cumarsáid chuimsitheach idir na comhlachtaí forbartha áitiúla ag gabháil seirbhísí iontacha tábhachtacha ar na hoileáin. Tháinig an t-airgead trí Chomhar na nOileán agus anois tá an dualgas agus an fhreagracht leis an eagraíocht sin fá choinne an t-airgead sin a bhaint amach. Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a ghabháil leis an dream sin fá choinne an dualgas sin a bheith aici thar na blianta.The challenges that affect island communities, while similar to those in the rest of rural Ireland, tend to have an extra dimension owing to their separation from the mainland. Issues such as the provision of housing, the delivery of education and healthcare and employment opportunities are magnified on the offshore islands. There is also the added challenge brought about by an ageing population. While a number of policies have been developed across government on an ad hoc basis in the education and health sectors, for example, with the HSE producing a report identifying many of the issues affecting island healthcare services, the Government recognises that an all-of-government approach is required in order for island communities to reach their full potential.  In 1993 an interdepartmental committee on island development was established with a remit of reviewing and prioritising development strategies and recommending actions to ensure a co-ordinated approach to all aspects of island development. The report of the interdepartmental committee which was published in 1996 aimed to set out the strategic framework within which future action related to the islands would be pursued. A major programme of State investment followed in several areas which resulted in issues surrounding access to and from the islands largely being resolved, as alluded to.  Arising from the ongoing consultation with local island communities, island representative organisations and Oireachtas Members, it is acknowledged that it is important to re-establish an interdepartmental committee for the islands to inform the process of developing a new, cross-government policy. Additionally, if the introduction of legislation is seen as a necessary component of this process, such legislative proposals as may be required will be brought to the Government for approval. Rinneadh cinneadh ag an gcruinniú Rialtais i mí Iúil i mbliana, agus gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Seán Kyne, fá choinne an chinnidh sin. At the Cabinet meeting held on 25 July in Glencolmcille the Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Kyne, informed the Cabinet of his intention to form and chair an interdepartmental committee for island development. An invitation has been extended to all relevant Departments, including my own which is committed to this approach and will be a full partner at the table. I want to see more partnerships, synergy and creativity, based on some very good examples. I refer, for example, to Sherkin Island where there is a partnership between the Technological University of Dublin, TUD, and the local community. I want to see more of this and already conversations are happening on initiating something similar on Tory Island. This initiative will require co-operation and an input from all relevant Departments and their agreement on the policy. Following on from this work, an action plan will be developed that will comprise defined measurable actions associated with various parties, with timeframes set out to ensure the roll out of these actions. To allay the concerns of Deputies about island representation, I stress that there will be an ongoing and comprehensive consultation process with island communities to ensure island voices will have a high level of input into the deliberations of the committee on various aspects of island life, including, among other issues, housing, health, energy, waste management, climate change, education, communication, employment and transport. The consultation process will include ongoing meetings with relevant stakeholders, including bilateral meetings with Departments and agencies and island representative groups, as well as public meetings. While much of what is stated in the Private Members' motion as proposed by the Opposition is to be commended, the work carried out by successive Governments since 1996 to improve services for the islands should be acknowledged, which is what the Government's amendment to the motion seeks to do.  I conclude by commending my colleague on leading to ensure we will have a common-sense approach through an interdepartmental committee. This important committee will build on the good work that is already happening on the islands. There is a lot of innovative work ongoing. On Árainn Mhór, for example, almost 50 students from the mainland are being ferried to a secondary school on the island on a daily basis. That is a massive change. I acknowledge all-island communities for their industry, innovation, initiatives and díograis during the years when there were many challenges, some of which persist today. The only way we will ensure progress is through an interagency and interdepartmental approach in partnership with island communities. I know that colleagues on all sides of the House will not be found wanting in that regard. Deputy Connolly raised an issue related to an island school. I will get the details and respond to her directly.

Tugann sé deis iontach dúinn ceisteanna faoi na hoileáin a phlé, go háirithe na fadhbanna agus na dúshláin atá acu i láthair na huaire, agus ar ndóigh tá a lán fadhbanna acu. Tá an-chuidiú de dhíth orthu. Níl sé furasta maireachtáil ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta. Caithfidh an Rialtas agus na Ranna éagsúla gach cuidiú a thabhairt do na hoileáin seo agus do na daoine a bhfuil ina gcónaí orthu. I compliment my colleagues in the Independents 4 Change group for tabling this important Private Member's motion which Fianna Fáil will be supporting. The Government's decision to table an amendment and set up an interdepartmental committee has come very late in the day. It may have been decided at the aforementioned meeting held in Glencolmcille which was the only time in the last 11 months that the Minister of State visited County Donegal since he was appointed. He did not step into the Donegal Gaeltacht in all of that time. He breezed in and out. He got out as quickly as he could before any delegation could meet him. In the past Ministers of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, going back to the first one, Tom O' Donnell, and all of his successors, including me, Mary Coughlan and Dinny McGinley, were not only Ministers of State but were also considered to be Deputies for the Gaeltacht and the islands. We visited the islands and Gaeltacht regions on a regular basis. Immediately on the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, he or she visited all of the various Gaeltacht regions throughout the country.  We might not have time this evening to debate the recent flooding in County Donegal, about which the Minister of State totally ignored us. We just received a text which read, "Sound". There was no communication whatsoever. What hope do the islanders have of communicating with the Minister of State when he will not even communicate with those who have been elected to represent them and the Gaeltacht? That is typical of the Government. I often wonder what it would do if it had an overall majority. We are there to try to assist it in the best interests of the country and have done so, but the Minister of State totally ignored us. I was on Árainn Mhór when he was Minister of State previously, with Deputy McHugh who was a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora at the time. We visited the road to the lighthouse which was in urgent need of repair. I said to both of them in a facetious way that we had better get back to the mainland soon because the lorries would be on the road the next day. To save embarrassment, some time afterwards, a small grant was made available to repair some potholes. However, the response was that as it was not a county road, nothing could be done. The scenery was beautiful and both Ministers of State were totally enthusiastic and said they would provide funding but none has been provided since.  Fianna Fáil has always recognised the special value and rights of offshore island communities. In government we have consistently supported the islands and those who call them home. We assigned responsibility for the islands to a full Cabinet Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.He was the first Minister responsible for both the Gaeltacht and the islands, and he was always available to visit the various Gaeltachtaí and the islands. I think of 2009, when we had the tuilte, particularly in the Gweedore area in west Donegal. Within a matter of days, the then Minister was there to inspect at first hand the damage done. He provided the necessary funds to repair bridges that were not on county roads. Now we have been told in respect of damage done to a bridge in the west Donegal Gaeltacht that the Government cannot get involved. Of course that is the responsibility of an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, who at least came back and communicated with us. The present Government and its preceding Governments between 2011 and 2016 very much neglected our islands and their communities, to such a point that the islands are under serious threat. The islanders are struggling. The public services are stripped down. There are declining populations, which have been mentioned. The decline in the populations is understandable. There was a decline of 155 between 2011, when the figure was 2,889, and 2016, when the census figure was 2,734, representing a drop of 5.4%. I am surprised it is not more. This demonstrated to us at first hand the challenges that lie ahead. We now find that, as a result of a Government decision and a proposal by the Minister of State responsible for the Gaeltacht and the islands, it has been decided, almost eight years later, that the Government is to establish an interdepartmental committee for the islands. How appropriate. The first meeting is to be held on 24 September, next week. The Minister might inform us later whether all the Gaeltacht representatives have been informed and invited. Who may attend? What is happening is typical. It is very obvious that there is to be an election in the coming months if the Government is trying to convey to the islanders that it has their interests at heart. The Government, including the current Minister, will be judged on its performance over the past seven or eight years. We have had debates on this issue. My party is committed to the islands. It had a strong record of delivery between 1997 and 2011. It gave a Minister full responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, under one Department. It provided €100 million for the infrastructural development of the islands and the development of comprehensive ferry services between the mainland and the islands. It saw the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio on the islands and the provision of a social welfare allowance to compensate islanders for the higher cost of living. It provided for the annual infrastructure fund for the development of the islands. This is looking back but, of course, we must also look forward. Our policy will focus on providing adequate State-contracted transport services providing full access to the islands. Having spoken to a number of representatives of all the islands, especially from my county as others can speak for theirs, I noted the one problem they all have concerns roads. I have to hand photographs of the roads on some of the islands, which I could make available. I am referring not only to conditions over recent weeks but also over recent years, including on Gola and the small islands, such as Owey, Inishbofin, Tory and Arranmore. All of these islands require funding. We are told there may be some funding available. Táimid i lár mhí Mheán Fómhair agus tá an t-airgead á chur ar fáil anois. Ba chóir go raibh an t-airgead sin curtha ar fáil níos luaithe sa bhliain ionas go mbeadh seans na bóithre sin a dheisiú i rith an tsamhraidh.
Maybe, however, there is another major project in some other part of the country that is not in Donegal that might require substantial funds between now and the end of the year. It could be a once-off project and the rest of the islands could be paying for this. This is wrong. It shows the Government has no interest in the islands and no rural development policies as far as the islands are concerned. All the Government is interested in is ensuring the success of other projects on which the Minister might have his eye. Perhaps he might tell us what projects he hopes will come to fruition and that would be used to ensure the money would not be returned to the Exchequer. We recognise the traditional rights of islanders, including in respect of roads and piers. The Minister, Deputy McHugh, mentioned Project 2040. Reference was made to Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr and it is said there will be a major project for Magheroarty, which is not an island but which services Inishbofin and Tory. The project would recognise its importance. I remind the Minister in his absence that he made a commitment on Raidió na Gaeltachta when he was Minister responsible for the Gaeltacht. He said Magheroarty breakwater, a major infrastructural project, was to be completed in 2020. It is not even on the drawing board yet, let alone in construction or planning. This is a cynical approach. The Government's representative in Donegal is good at making announcements but there is no follow through. It is very easy to hit the first golf ball but it is more difficult to get it right. We are hitting the golf balls all the time but no progress has been made. Thug an tAire, an Teachta McHugh, a fhocal ar RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta go mbeadh tonnchosc ché Mhachaire Uí Rabhartaigh ann sa bhliain 2020. Nuair a bheidh an tAire céanna ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht seo, b'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé in iúl dúinn cén áit a bhfuil an togra sin. Cé nach oileán é, tá an ché sin ag freastal ar Thoraigh agus Inis Bó Finne. Nuair a luaigh an tAire na hoileáin sin, ní dúirt sé dada fadúda ché Reannaigh ar Oileán Árainn Mhór. Bhí díospóireacht agam leis an Aire níos mó ná bliain ó shin sa Teach seo ina ndúirt sé nach raibh Comhairle Contae Dhún na nGall i dteagmháil leis an Roinn maidir leis seo. Chuireamar in iúl dó i ndiaidh sin go raibh Comhairle Contae Dhún na nGall i dteagmháil leis maidir le cé Reannaigh ar an oileán sin. Níor luaigh sé é sin, fiú. Maidir leis na h-oileáin eile i nDún na nGall cosúil le hInis Bó Finne, Inis Mhic an Doirn agus Inis Fraoigh, tá airgead de dhíth orthu go léir. Nílimid ag caint faoi airgead mór ach airgead réasúnta chun na bóithre a dheisiú. Last year, we supported a Private Members' motion from Sinn Féin on fishing rights and island communities. We were glad to do that but it has now come to my attention that there will be a money order relating to this. That stops us in our tracks and means we cannot go any further. We are very supportive of this motion by Independents 4 Change. It was very cynical to suggest that next Tuesday there is to be a meeting on development, with so many attending from all the Departments and island communities. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours but it is a bit cynical coming at this late stage in the life of the Government.
Táimid ag tabhairt a lán-tacaíocht don rún seo maidir leis na hoileáin amach ón gcósta. Impím ar an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh do na bóithre. Is féidir é sin a dhéanamh go luath agus an t-airgead a chur ar fáil díreach.Tá Comhairle Contae Dhún na nGall réidh chun tús a chur leis an obair chun na bóithre sin a dheisiú. Maidir leis na céanna, tá súil agam go mbeidh scéal anocht maidir le cé Reannaigh. Mar a dúirt mé go minic, tá an ché seo ar an gclár oibre le blianta fada. Tá sé in am don Rialtas seo déileáil leis. Ní fiú dul ar ais go dtí na blianta roimh 2011. Tá an Rialtas i gcumhacht ar feadh ocht mbliana anois. Tá sé in am aige rud éigin a dhéanamh fadúda é seo.

Is fócas é nach mbíonn ag an institiúid seo, ag an Rialtas ná ag cuid mhór de phobal na hÉireann go minic. Ní dhírítear air go minic agus is mór an trua é sin. Is trua é freisin nach dtógann an chuid is mó de pholaiteoirí, saoránaigh agus grúpaí pobail cad atá ag tarlú ar na hoileáin san áireamh nuair atá siad ag forbairt polasaithe, ag dáileadh seirbhísí nó tacaíochtaí, nó ag smaoineamh ar obair a dhéanamh. Ní thógann siad na deacrachtaí atá acu siúd atá ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin san áireamh. Measaim gurb é an t-aon uair a thugann a lán daoine sa Stát tús áite dóibh siúd ar na hoileáin ná nuair a chaitheann siad a vótaí toisc gurb iad an chéad dream a chaitheann iad. Díríonn na meáin chumarsáide isteach orthu ar feadh lá amháin agus is minic a dhéantar dearmad orthu ina dhiaidh sin. Ba chóir go dtabharfaimis níos mó tosaíochta dóibh siúd atá ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin agus ag obair orthu agus do na deacrachtaí atá acu fanacht agus cuidiú leis an gcultúr agus traidisiún a ghabhann le bheith i gcónaí ar oileán. Mar a dúirt mé, tá deacrachtaí ann. Tá sé ag éirí níos deacra do a lán daoine a bheith ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin sin, go háirithe de bharr an bhrú níos mó atá ann sa tsochaí. Bíonn sé deacair ar thithe earraí difriúla a fháil. Tá brú ann maidir le siopaí agus oideachas. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé ag éirí níos éasca leis an oiread dul chun cinn atá déanta againn mar gheall ar bhóithre, innealra, gléasanna nua-aimseartha, na meáin chumarsáide, agus na meáin shóisialta. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éasca orthu, nó beagáinín níos éasca ar aon chor, ach is é an chuma atá ar an scéal ná go bhfuil sé ag éirí níos deacra. Sin é an fáth go bhfuil muid ag feiceáil níos lú agus níos lú daoine ag fanacht agus ag tógáil a gclann ar na hoileáin. Ag cur leis sin, toisc go bhfuil an Ghaeilge láidir ar an gcuid is mó de na hoileáin timpeall na tíre - mar shampla, Oileáin Árann amach ó chósta na Gaillimhe nó leithéidí Thoraigh nó Inis Bó Finne - tá roinnt den dul in éag mar gheall ar an nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht gafa leis sin. As the motion states, the experts on offshore islands are not those within this House, myself included, but those who live on the islands. They need to be listened to. If we do not listen to them, we will lose a valuable and unique cultural and traditional resource. They are people and they deserve to live. They deserve the rights and services their specific area needs. I do not understand why the Government's amendment acknowledges the dynamism of island communities and so on but seeks to establish an interdepartmental committee without, it seems, consulting the islanders first. I welcome the Independents 4 Change motion. It was brought forward in good faith and what it contains comes from the frustrations of the island communities, which arise from the meaningless promises that were made to them from 1996 onwards, and even before then. We should reject the Government's amendment and support the motion to send a message to those who are living and surviving on the islands that we have their interests at heart and will continue to work with them and for them.

Cuireann an rún ceist i lár an tseomra anocht. Is seoid náisiúnta luachmhar atá againn sna hoileáin amach ónár gcósta. Tá cuid acu tréigthe agus tá pobail bhríomhar bheo ag maireachtáil ar chuid eile acu, ach ag maireachtáil le go leor deacrachtaí. Tá a fhios againn, agus tá sé ráite cheana féin, go bhfuil an iomarca déanta thar na blianta ó thaobh na n-oileán de. Tá sin le feiceáil agus le cluinstin nuair a éisteann duine le pobail na n-oileán iad féin. Tá siad gan na hacmhainní agus na huirlisí chun na pobail sin a dhéanamh níos bríomhaire. Tá siad ag iarraidh maireachtáil lena dteaghlaigh ar na hoileáin. Níl dabht ar bith ach go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar na hoileáin le linn thréimhse an Rialtais agus i rith thréimhse Rialtas Fhianna Fáil fosta. Ach, sin ráite, nuair a labhraítear le mórchuid de phobail na n-oileán deir siad nach bhfuil go leor á dhéanamh. Tá sin iontach soiléir ón neamhaird atá á dhéanamh ar na hoileáin. Chínn muid é sin i go leor rudaí difriúla. Chínn muid é ó thaobh cúrsaí iascaireachta de. Is féidir a bheith ar oileáin ag amharc amach ar an fharraige ar achan taobh ach ní cheadaítear eangach a chur amach ón mbád mar ní cheadaítear iascaireacht ar na hoileáin anois. Tá reachtaíocht agam féin agus an Teachta Martin Kenny - the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 - ar luaigh an Teachta Gallagher. Tá an Rialtas ag cur bac ar an reachtaíocht sin. It is important legislation which would allow for the island fishermen and fisherwomen to go back to their traditional way of life and to fish the waters around their islands. The Bill looks at best practice across Europe and what is happening in other jurisdictions. The Government, however, is using a money message. The reason it is using that to declare this a financial drain on the State, that is to say how it can get away with using a money message, is that sending out the heritage licence to the fishermen on the islands would cost money as they would require stamps. That is ridiculous and is probably the highlight of the Government's disrespect for the fishing community on the islands and for the island communities themselves.  There have been some positive developments on the islands, which I welcome. These include, over different periods, piers, schools and so on. These are very positive. The reality, however, is that we are still not doing enough for the islands. The islands should not be an issue that divides this House. I ask the Government to withdraw its amendment. As Dáil Éireann, we should recognise the islands as a national treasure. Every day, as I sit down for my breakfast or dinner and look out my window, I see Gola Island. It pains me to think of it being deserted in the 1960s. It is possible that it would not have been if the right decisions had been made and the right policies put in place to support the way of life on the island at that point. We need to make sure that families that currently reside on islands and their children - whether on Árainn Mhór off Donegal, on Toraigh, or on islands off Galway, Mayo or Kerry - can continue to live and to have the opportunity to live a full and fulfilling life on the island. That opportunity is not there at this point in time in any full sense. There has been talk about promises of this, that and the other and we see the stroke of setting up a committee to counter this motion.The island community has heard broken promises in the past. It is two years ago this week when the now Minister, Deputy McHugh - it is a pity that he left the Chamber after his speech - went to the Tory Island community and told it that he had secured €4 million for a new ferry. He told the community that the ferry would be built within 18 months to two years. There is no ferry. There is not even a line in the budget concerning the €4 million ferry. As Deputy Gallagher mentioned, the Minister also told the community that there was €2.5 million for Magheroarty and that its breakwater would be delivered next year. It is not happening. There are no plans at this point in time. The project is not advanced, yet we see press release after press release. In reality, there are things that we can do that will support the islands. We should be coming at this from a non-party political point of view. We should recognise that the island has a unique tradition, a saibhreas of teanga and a large history of culture. It would be an absolute sin if we as parliamentarians in 2019 did not instigate the types of measure and support that are necessary to ensure that the community thrives into the future and can reach its full potential. I commend the Independents' motion to the House. I genuinely appeal to the Minister of State at this late stage not to divide the House on the issue of the islands. Let us come together and make a positive contribution to that community, which needs not a handout, but a hand up.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	404	Is mór an onóir é dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Like many who were brought up in cities or towns, particularly as I was in the centre of Dublin, my experience as a 15 and 16 year old of spending summers in the Gaeltacht on Arranmore in Donegal was amazing. I have always viewed all of the islands that I have had the good fortune to spend time on subsequently as magical places. From my experience of speaking to their people in a personal capacity when visiting privately and as someone involved in what is now the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection under three Governments, it is essential to resource the islands adequately. The Government is probably a little frightened of this motion. It is an open motion that speaks to the islands' incredible linguistic and cultural heritage, but also to their potential now that considerable advances in technology mean that their isolation, which was once such an elemental feature of island life, does not need to be the case in the same way as it was in the time of Peig. If there was investment, the islands could not only be a significant resource for the islanders themselves, but also for the rest of Ireland and the world. What this Government often lacks is the imagination to see potential and, as time passes, potential changes. I get the feeling from the Government that, in many ways, it sees the islands as a charge and a drag rather than as a positive opportunity. In terms of biodiversity, the islands are a unique resource. We are in discussions with the EU and the UN about our international commitments in respect of various environmental plans. In many ways, the islands are a major source of biodiversity, for example, fishing and what is to be found on the islands themselves. The Government should have a little bravery, which is lacking currently, and seek to utilise this resource. It is for the Ministers with responsibility to have some courage and provide structures that allow islanders to be seriously involved in plans concerning their islands. I have enough experience to know that every island is different and has its own views about how it should be developed. The GAA has a good slogan - "Give Respect Get Respect". The Government should give respect to the islands and the people who live on them. As a lecturer in what was DIT and is now TU Dublin, I had many students from islands right around the Irish coast. Although some ended up living away from the islands permanently, what was unique to almost all of those young people was that, although they lived away from the islands for ten, 15 or 20 years, they went back at a different stage in their lives to give their children an opportunity to experience the uniqueness of island life. The Government lacks imagination about what is a unique resource for Ireland's culture, history and biodiversity. We should see the islands in that way. The Government might put up its hands and say that it does not have all the money at the moment, but it is possible to create, maintain and resource community infrastructures that provide islanders with a sense of empowerment and a connection with people in far off large towns and cities such as Letterkenny, Dublin and Cork. There has been a large growth in various forms of tourism in Ireland, for example, walking, cycling and so on. The islands lend themselves to many of these important and modern tourism activities for people visiting the Wild Atlantic Way. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a successful concept. Of course, there are other islands around the coast. People on the islands must feel respected by the Government and that their issues are viewed as important. I support the motion. For islanders, including young people, the issue of education is important. Parents have the same ambitions for their children about achieving as best they can in whatever it is they want to do. Obviously, the islands have tremendous fishing resources. We have fishing communities on various islands around our coastline and in the ports close to them. It is possible to draw up an exciting plan for the future of life on the islands. Many of the islands experience difficult winter weather. Let us be honest - people like me tend to visit them when the weather is nice. That is the experience of most people who live on the mainland. With modern technology, islanders, including older people, can be resourced to improve and weatherproof their housing. It is possible to transform life on the islands. There are problems for older people in terms of medical services and other services that people require. It is a taxing job for anyone in government to provide the support that the islands need in order to make them viable and, in many ways, the jewel in the crown of many visitors' experience in Ireland. The Labour Party supports this motion. It is possible to envisage a very good future for the islands. From a recent visit to Sherkin Island, I saw the collaboration between the educational initiatives on the island and TU Dublin, my old college where I taught for many years.I think that has given tremendous opportunities to people-----

I come from the constituency of Cork South-West with its fair share of islands and peninsulas. I support the contents of the Independents 4 Change motion and thank them for bringing this debate forward. The eight islands in west Cork, namely, Heir Island, Bere Island, Sherkin Island, Cape Clear, Whiddy Island, Dursey Island, Long Island and Garnish Island, offer fantastic activities and intriguing histories. They are known to be strung like jewels along the south-west coast of Ireland. I agree with the call on the Government to develop a policy for offshore islands in order that the communities there and back on the mainland can be cohesive and progressive. The Government needs to engage in meaningful consultation with the islanders. From my own clinics on the islands and along the coast, I know full well the issues that affect the islands on a day-to-day basis, which include transport and ferries to the island, the limited access to healthcare and general practitioner, GP, services, the declining numbers of inhabitants on islands due to the lack of infrastructure or strong communication links, such as network coverage and Internet access. This latter issue limits job prospects and educational opportunities for people living there whose parents and grandparents lived there before them. These islands have unique assets and considerable economic potential. I commend the local tourism groups that work hard to promote and boost jobs in their local economies. The Minister and Deputy Burton have spoken about the arts degree course on Sherkin Island, which has been a stunning success for the island and farther afield. People such as Mr. Timmy O'Leary and others on Whiddy Island work hard to boost tourism in that region. However, there are issues on the islands that need to be tackled and addressed. When the school on Sherkin Island shut down, the efforts to which the islanders had gone to get young people to stay on the island were ruined because to date, there has been a failure to provide a chaperone to bring their children to and from the island. There is a lack of a residential nurse on Bere Island. What will happen in the event of an elderly person falling ill at night or a woman in labour or any type of emergency? This situation cannot continue. It is vital that a nurse be reinstated. There is a lack of social housing on islands like Whiddy Island, Cape Clear, Sherkin Island and Bere Island. Social housing on these islands would turn them around but it has not happened. There are many such situations and all this potential has been somewhat limited due to the inaction of successive Governments in implementing progressive and positive policies to help these islanders.  The 2016 census noted a decline in the population of offshore islands by 155 persons, a significant 5.4% drop since the 2011 census. This represents a serious challenge for the future of our islands. The uncertainty regarding Brexit is another issue of concern to people living on our islands. Issues around our seas and fisheries policies also will have a detrimental effect on the communities if they are not ironed out. I urge the Government to accept this motion in order to stop further economic decline across our islands from west Cork to Donegal, many of which experience the same issues every day.

It is important that we keep our islands on the agenda for improvement. It is sad that numbers are declining all the time on the islands that are still inhabited, despite the fact that we have more modern means of transport and better ways of getting on and off these islands. That is the trend and, as was mentioned already, peninsulas such as the Iveragh Peninsula are suffering a decline in population because we cannot get work or job opportunities for people in such places. The same applies to the islands. The only future for the Blasket Islands and smaller islands such as Rossdohan and Rossmore is by developing the tourism product. I am personally familiar with Rossdohan Island, where there is an old castle that was very modern in its time. When one stands in that castle, one can see all the way up to the suspension bridge in Kenmare. There is a future there if tourism is enhanced and developed to ensure the island does not go into further decline. I am disappointed to relay what happened in Valentia Island this year. Two area plans, which spanned 12 years, zoned a little section on the island as residential. Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae proposed that it be zoned as residential again in the most recent area plan for south Kerry. The council all voted for it but, lo and behold, the planning regulator arrived down from Dublin and threatened all kinds of action. Despite it being proposed again by Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae, the rest of the council decided it was safer not to vote for the area to be zoned as residential again. For the 12 years it was zoned as residential, only two houses were built in it but it has now been ensured that no house will be built in this little plot of ground. That is wrong because if one cannot build a house for people, how can any place be sustained? We are very proud that Mr. Mick O'Connell, who hailed from that great island, Valentia Island, is still hale and hearty and he fully supported the zoning of this area and he would not want anything bad to happen to the place in which he was born and raised and lived all his life. It is sad to think that, despite his wishes and those of many other locals, the planning regulator got his way, the land is de-zoned and no houses will be built. My brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, and I also sought funding for a new ferry service for that island. That has not been forthcoming from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. He has done much harm to rural Ireland but he would not even do that bit of good to provide the funding for that small request for a new ferry.

He got help from Members in this Chamber to be hard on the people of rural Ireland. He has caused much hurt, anger and anguish to many people around the country without any need or justification. It is clear that he did not, and does not, know or understand what the people of rural Ireland have to go through to live, remain and travel around the places where they live, to go to work and other necessary things such as attending schools. The Minister does not understand it. I am still very disappointed with the Deputies who backed the Minister. They should have known because many of them are from rural places and should not have allowed him to do what he has done to rural Ireland. He has practically shut down rural Ireland.

The key argument set out in the motion before us is accurate, particularly the reference to the ad hoc nature of how we are managing and developing the islands. I am familiar with Inishbofin off the coast of Galway and may take that as an example. What the Minister and Government have stated is true - there have been real improvements.There is now a first class ferry to the island, which is of huge benefit. On the other hand, a runway was built on the western side of the island. I cannot remember how much it cost - it must have been the guts of €5 million to €10 million - but one can only think of what could have been done with that money. There was a matching runway in Cleggan, but both are now sitting idle. Submissions were invited on what should be done with the runways. I made my submission about a year and a half or two years ago and we have not heard anything back since. That is an example of the ad hoc nature of the process and the lack of a clear sense of direction or development. I mention Inishbofin in that context. It is related to the first point made by Deputy Connolly about island communities, namely, that they have unparalleled knowledge of both the problems and the solutions to ensure a sustainable future. To back up that contention, I cite the great green economist, Richard Douthwaite, who was very familiar with Inishbofin. He used to stay with friends who were living just above the harbour. He was a brilliant green economist who looked at alternative ways of measuring progress and seeing the limits on growth. He called it the growth illusion. He thought the islands were very useful places with which to start in thinking about this issue because what went onto or came off an island was measurable. That first point in the second part of Deputy Connolly's motion is absolutely right. As well as for their own intrinsic right to development and importance, if there is a need for another argument in favour of investment on the islands, they are the perfect test cases for the massive transition we will need to make towards sustainability. I will give a few pointers in that regard that might steer the Government or the committee when it meets next Tuesday in considering what that might involve.  First, good examples are starting to evolve in considering how the islands might be energy independent. I refer to the first test cases in respect of the new 100% renewable sustainable energy and zero carbon future we are heading towards. The community energy co-operative on Inis Mór has done very good work and is often cited as the best case. We should take what it is doing and encourage it to go further. We should support, facilitate and fund it to go further. As we move the entire island system towards the use of electric vehicles, electric heating, properly retrofitted buildings and battery storage systems to store wind energy, we learn lessons that will be applicable in other areas. The same applies to all of the islands which have particular difficulties in getting fossil fuels out to them. There are security risks. There are costs involved in that regard. It is to make the case for islands as a special place to become energy centres. Second, in terms of food, I will start with fisheries because there is a need for a complete shift away from massive marine protected areas. We need to stop big offshore trawlers catching all of the fish and allow fish to reach us and the islands to become some of the first locations where we start to restore inshore fisheries. If we can again develop the island fisheries systems, we will also develop the connecting ports. If we can develop half a dozen half deckers on Inishbofin, we will find the same can be done on Cleggan and that the distribution system that will work on Inishbofin will work on Cleggan. The same applies to Castletownbere and Bere Island and Inis Mór and Rossaveal which I understand has just lost its fish factories. If we could develop fisheries and the supply chain to the islands and also connect Rossaveal, that would work. It is interesting that we are having this debate on the same evening we had the debate on the beef farming issue. Given my experience on Inishbofin and elsewhere, the real question is: where is the next generation of farmers for the island? Who will maintain the landscape and the incredible special sense of nature? I know some of the farmers. While they are young of heart, they are not that young. I cited a case. There was a training programme in west Connemara and the youngest person attending it was 48 years old. They were the young farmer. If we could get farming sorted on the islands, it would help us in similar areas in rural Ireland. If one of the solutions to the farming issue is connections to the consumer progeny - a sense of where things come from - as a product, Inishbofin lamb would attract a premium price and have a connection to the market. In its response the Government stated that half a million people go to the islands. They have a connection, so we could connect the food to those people. I was talking to my colleague Saoirse McHugh who ran in the European Parliament elections. She had a great time canvassing and one of the reasons was no matter where she went, when she said she was from Achill Island, the world and its wife sensed that they had a connection. They would say, "I know Achill. Do you know Paddy Joe in Dugort?" That sense of connection is important. Connecting food from the islands might be how we start encouraging a new generation of young farmers who will form a new life on the islands because they would be able to gain a valid income from producing food to which people could connect because they would know from where it was coming. When I talk to islanders, they scratch their heads and say what they fear losing is the rich cultural life - the language, the music and everything else about island life. The term used is "island skills", that sense of men and women who are multi-tasking. They have great capability to turn their hand to construction, fisheries, farming and fixing things. We are now educating everyone to go. We should educate people in island skills, which would be as useful as any degree and is something that requires real wisdom. We should value it. If we do not do this, we will continue to see the population decline. We need to value island skills.

Economic activity is usually limited to three areas - agriculture, fishing and tourism - but one of the biggest threats is the loss of population owing to limited work opportunities, especially for talented young people. In many respects, the islands are victims of their own success because with the powerful pupil-teacher ratio, many island children go on to third level, but when they come out of third level with their degrees, there are limited work opportunities to bring them back to the islands. What we are seeing, therefore, is a brain drain from the islands. The islands have so many advantages compared to the mainland. Island communities are innovative, adaptive and self-reliant because they have to be. There is very strong community involvement. Successive Governments have failed to recognise this and support island communities that are struggling to survive. The failure has not been the result of a lack of goodwill. There have been occasional beneficial efforts made. I acknowledge that they are included in the Minister's amendment, but there has been a deep misunderstanding of the nature of the problems islanders face and how to fix them. I will give some examples.  Many policies implemented nationally can work well on the mainland, but they impact negatively on the islands and very often have serious repercussions. That is because island communities are small and isolated and do not have the range of services and skills the policies presuppose. I have three examples. Many smaller island communities cannot provide a crèche or preschool facilities simply because of the onerous training and qualifications now demanded. Another example is the provision of recycling and waste disposal facilities. Again, the legal requirements are extremely onerous for the small scale facilities required. Another example is the regulations that were brought forward for accommodation associated with Irish colleges. They have had detrimental consequences for island communities. Student numbers had to be reduced to almost unsustainable numbers. For many families, the summer colleges are their main source of income to sustain them throughout the year. The feeling is the new rules were brought forward to suit areas such as Connemara where there are large pupil populations during the summer months. I believe the islands are great locations to pilot environmental and natural resources based innovations if the red tape issue could somehow be resolved. Time and again, islanders have to fend for themselves.They are prevented from doing so by well-meaning legislation that imposes an impossible burden of compliance on them. Good proposals remain undone and problems remain unsolved.  The 1996 report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, which is the latest published strategy on the islands, pledged to begin work immediately to get a programme of work up and running. Since then initiatives have been adopted on an ad hoc basis that are entirely insufficient to address the growing needs for action. Currently, there is no policy for offshore islands and that has to be rectified. Offshore and inshore islands differ greatly, not only from a geographical point of view, but also from a socioeconomic point of view and have to be treated differently. We failed the Blasket Islands in 1954 when the islanders were forced to abandon their homes and we have been lamenting this loss ever since. In 2009, €2 million was spent buying land there with the intention of establishing the islands as a national historic park and developing sustainable tourism. The Minister at the time described the purchase as "a major advancement of the objective to preserve an important component of our national cultural, historic and linguistic heritage". The objective should surely be to preserve, protect and support the living island communities so that they do not become the next Blasket Islands. We have to be proactive rather than reactive.  In 2016, €250,000 was allocated to the OPW for phase 1 of the development of new visitor facilities on the Great Blasket Island. If that support had been there pre-1954, it would have enabled islanders to remain and those type of facilities would have developed organically. Every islander's fear is that his or her island would be the next Blasket Island. They do not want their homes turned into museums. We have living communities that need to be protected. Tory Island was in the same position. It would have been abandoned only for islanders, under an tAthair Ó Peicín, ensured that their island communities survived.  Last April, Cork County Council was set to seek planning permission for an iconic €7 million project aimed at transforming Dursey Island, one of the countries most southwesterly islands into a tourist mecca. The 2016 census, however, showed that the island had four residents. The conclusion is that this was for west Cork, in the same way that the Blasket Islands project is for County Kerry. Those kind of investments can surely be better conceived. Islands are struggling to keep their primary schools open. Why not build centres on those islands that still have viable populations? The island I know best is Cléire, where the comharchumann and the community have been very innovative and inventive. In the past five years they have leveraged the nearby iconic Fastnet Rock lighthouse into a major tourist attraction, with numbers increasing year on year. The tour has won many accolades, recognised by National Geographic as one of the ten best on the Wild Atlantic Way and by the Irish Independent as one of the seven wonders of Ireland but it is the only wonder that is not Government-funded. Cléire has shown the way so why is there not an urgent pivot of State investment in iconic tourism infrastructure towards island with living populations? Some €150 million is currently earmarked by Fáilte Ireland for immersive heritage and cultural experiences. What portion if any of that will be invested in our inhabited offshore islands? There is an urgent priority regarding housing. Families and young children who want to live on the pristine environment of islands, with the excellent pupil-teacher ratio, are being priced out because there is a limited supply of housing on islands and there is competition from wealthy people for luxury summer houses. There is also an ability for one individual to own two or three homes on an island and leave them uninhabited. There is a need for a flexible housing policy through community associations and local co-operatives on islands. Closing an island school is the death knell because without children, they effectively become retirement homes. Irish Water did major work on Cléire laying rainwater pipes and it had to redo the roads it had disturbed, which covered two thirds of the island. There was no joined-up thinking with the council, which is to repair the other one third of the roads. The infrastructure, equipment and workforce will have to be brought back. I just do not understand how this can happen. We are all agreed on the need for a policy for all islands where the needs of islanders will drive the agenda. Who understands those needs, challenges and reality best but the islanders, not officials, some of whom have never set foot on an island or perhaps have spent an hour or two on a visit. Islanders must be on that interdepartmental committee to ensure that the policy is in line with their specific needs to enable the islands to grow and flourish.  We have the example of the programme implementation board that was set up to address the needs of the north inner city following the gangland feud and years of neglect. There were high-level officials from all Departments on that board but there were also two community representatives on that programme implementation board, so this can be done. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas agus comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Dála Ó Conghaile agus a hoifig as an obair a rinne siad i gcomhair an ghnó seo. History repeats itself for those who are unwilling to learn from the past. We can learn from past mistakes but it means acting now. D'imigh na daoine amach chun na míntíre. Tá an Blascaod Mór ciúin anois, leis féin os cionn na taoide. Let there be no more islands silenced on the coast of Ireland. The best way to do that is to have islanders involved in addressing their needs.

I have studied the proposal and I wanted to be able to support it. Two issues were alluded to by the Minister, Deputy McHugh. One related to the inaction of successive Governments in addressing the needs of offshore islands. I was particularly concerned that Fianna Fáil might take offence at that proposal but perhaps that was an undue concern.  The second and more interesting issue is on the membership of the interdepartmental committee and the inclusion of island representatives. It is an interdepartmental committee and we all want it to work and to improve the lives of islanders. Having islanders on this committee could be contrary to what Members wish for because I do not believe there will be openness among officials regarding the preparation of their plans. I respect the islanders and I engage quite a bit with them. I will fully engage with island representatives in the work of the interdepartmental committee. I am happy to meet them before, after and between the meetings, on a quarterly basis or whatever is necessary, but being part of the same meeting around the table could be counterproductive, which I know is not what the Deputies want. This is my concern. There was a plan in 1996, also as it happens under a Fine Gael Government, by the then Minister of State, Donal Carey. There has been considerable investment by successive Governments in island infrastructure but I acknowledge more is needed. A number of issues have been mentioned, including the primary care centre at Inisbofin. It has been refurbished, which has improved the appearance and usability of the centre. The HSE is progressing plans and we are co-operating with the executive on the allocation of a site next to but not impacting on the airstrip there. Regarding education on the islands, the Minister has undertaken to follow up the issues raised. My Department is continuing on from previous Governments in supporting secondary education ar na hoileáin. Tá daoine, trí scéimeanna atá eagraithe ag mo Roinn, ag freastal ar scoileanna ar na hoileáin. Tá 30 dalta ansin ó fud fad na tíre ann, ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, Ghaillimh, Chorcaigh agus chuile áit ag freastal ar na hoileáin agus tá an-tábhacht ag baint leis na scoláirí sin ó thaobh uimhreacha na múinteoirí agus mar sin de. I hope that after nearly nine years serving together that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, and I will not end up having a row. I acknowledged his concerns on the flooding. He mentioned Deputy Ó Cúiv visiting Gweedore at the time. That scheme was closed when Deputy Ó Cúiv was there and has not been resurrected since. My relatively small Department does not have funding for flooding in Gaeltacht areas. That is why I referred Deputy Gallagher to larger Departments such as those of the Ministers, Deputies Ring and Ross, and I am aware that officials from the Office of Public Works were also present. On the question of funding, since 2011, the Government has consistently found moneys for annual islands small-works programmes, including for roads. Last year, for example, more than €1,073,000 was spent, of which €359,000 went to Donegal and a much smaller allocation of €43,000 went to Galway. Deputy Gallagher mentioned that I was perhaps holding money back for a Galway project. There is a very important Galway project that I have no doubt his party supports.Deputy Connolly is also supporting it. Sin an obair atá muid ag déanamh chun Aerfort na Minne a cheannach. Táimid ag brú ar aghaidh leis an obair sin, agus is obair fhíorthábhachtach é ó thaobh todhchaí na n-oileán. Beidh airgead ag teastáil chun an airstrip sin a cheannach, ach táimid dóchasach go mbeimid in ann clár na n-oibreacha a fhoilsiú do na hoileáin go luath. Táimid fós ag obair air sin. I also remind the Deputies that nearly €100 million has been invested in capital industry on the islands for the past 20 years and a number of projects are listed in the plean forbartha náisiúnta. Maidir le cé Mhachaire Uí Rabhartaigh, bhí cruinniú againn le Comhairle Contae Dhún na nGall agus tá sé ag teacht ar ais chugainn le moltaí maidir le forbairt na cé. Maidir le cé Reannaigh, tá iarratas faighte againn anois ón gcomhairle contae agus beidh sé á mheas i gcomhthéacs an airgid atá ar fáil don Roinn agus na héilimh eile ar an airgead sin. Maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Pearse Doherty faoi bhád nua d’Oileán Thoraí, tá bád nua luaite sa phlean forbartha náisiúnta. Beidh an chéad chruinniú de choiste nua Thoraí ar siúl Dé hAoine agus beimid ag iarraidh brú ar aghaidh le forbairt chás gnó don bhád nua sin. Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Burton. We would all agree with Deputy Burton regarding the protection of biodiversity on our islands. My Department was at the forefront of developing and implementing the successful AranLIFE programme, which has gained international recognition in promoting the new Caomhnú Arann programme which has just begun. Deputy Michael Collins mentioned the BA programme in visual arts in Sherkin Island which has been guaranteed funding for the next three years thanks to the intervention of the Department. That is a very successful programme and one of which the Department is rightly proud of its role. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke about Valentia Island. As much as we would love to take on another island, it is linked with a bridge and there is also a ferry to the island. It is not regarded as one of the offshore islands because it is linked by a bridge. The issues the Deputy raised will have to be progressed through the county council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. With respect to Deputy Eamon Ryan's points, my Department is very supportive of islands which have become energy efficient and have moved away from fossil fuels. We supported the provision of electric vehicles and sustainable energy sources in the Aran Islands some years ago in conjunction the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. AranLife is also very relevant to the points the Deputy raised. Luaigh an Teachta Maureen O'Sullivan na coláistí Gaeilge. My Department stands over any regulations it has introduced to improve the experience of learning Irish. The Department currently spends more than €4 million per annum with the mná tí keeping Gaeilgeoirí. I increased the grant per capita during my first term as Minister of State. The issue of housing is one the new interdepartmental committee will have to get to grips with in terms
of
na liostaí feithimh agus an easpa tithe ar na hoileáin. Tá sé ag cruthú a lán deacrachtaí d’oileánaigh trasna na tíre. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh dul chun cinn ann maidir leis an ábhar sin. Déanaim iarracht dul amach ag breathnú ar rudaí ar na hoileáin agus dul ar cuairt ag na ceantair Ghaeltachta trasna na tíre. I have been to all the Gaeltacht areas in my two terms as Minister of State: an Mhí,
Port Láirge, Corcaigh, Ciarraí, Gaillimh - áit atá mé i mo chónaí - Maigh Eo agus Dún na nGall. Tá mé sásta casadh le haon ghrúpa nuair a bhím ar cuairt ar na háiteanna sin. An uair dheireanach a bhí mé ag cruinniú Rialtais, chas mé le grúpaí ó Ghleann Cholm Cille a d'eagraigh an tAire Oideachas agus Scileanna, an Teachta McHugh, agus tá mé sásta casadh le grúpaí ar son aon Teachta Dála áitiúil. Maidir leis an bplean gníomhaíochta do na hoileáin, I first announced this at the Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann annual general meeting last April or May in Inis Meáin. This has been a demand - is éileamh é seo ó na hoileánaigh le tamall. Bhí mé ag smaoineamh air an chéad uair a bhí mé i m'Aire Stát agus bhí mé sásta go raibh mé in ann glacadh leis i mbliana. Táimid ag brú ar aghaidh. Fuair muid cinneadh ó chruinniú Rialtais i nDún na nGall i mí Iúil, agus scríobh muid chuig chuile rannóg ina dhiaidh sin. Fuair muid ainmneacha ó na Ranna go léir agus scríobh muid chuig cuid acu ina dhiaidh sin arís nuair nach raibh ainmneacha faighte againn. Shocraigh muid an chéad chruinniú ansin. Dúirt mé tamall ó shin go mbeadh an chéad chruinniú ann i mí Mheán Fómhair agus tá mé sásta go mbeidh sé ar siúl an tseachtain seo chugainn. Tá mé sásta leis an chuid is mó de na rudaí atá luaite ag an Teachta, agus tá mé sásta casadh agus oibriú le hionadaithe ó na hoileáin, roimh nó ina dhiaidh cruinnithe, mar a dúirt mé. Sílim go gcruthaíonn sé fadhbanna, áfach, iad a bheith sa seomra céanna ag an gcruinniú céanna agus go n-imeoidh sé sin in aghaidh na rudaí atá an Teachta agus chuile dhuine anseo ag iarraidh déanamh. Tá mé sásta casadh leo agus comhoibriú leo agus mar sin de, seachas iad a bheith istigh sna cruinnithe. Sílim go gcuireann sé sin deacracht leis, agus níl mé ag iarraidh é sin a dhéanamh.

It is very important that the islands are an integral part of rural life and of Irish life and they should be treated as such. All the Members who spoke on the motion outlined the work that is happening and the value of the islands with which they are familiar. That is important in the context of this discussion. The Minister of State outlined the positive work that is happening on the various islands in his summing up of the discussion but in doing that he highlighted the problem in terms of the islands. There is no coherent plan and there does not seem to be a plan for the islands. That is the real problem. Things are going well in Dursey Island because the DIT is working there. Something else is going well on Tory Island and they have pulled everybody together and something else is going well on the Aran Islands. However, what we need is a plan for the islands as a whole to ensure that the islands will continue and develop, regardless of who is the Minister or what is happening in this House. That is what is important. What we would want to leave from our work in this House for the whole country is that there would be a plan for the islands in place. Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher outlined the work that happened when Fianna Fáil was in power. It was good work but it depended on Fianna Fáil being in power and on Deputy Ó Cuív being the Minister. It now depends on the Minister of State present having responsibility for the islands, and that is the problem across the board. It depends on who the Minister is and on he or she having a particular liking for the islands. We should be drawing up plans that will happen and work, regardless of who is Minister and of which party or parties are in government. Our islands should be recognised for the value they have and that should be enough to make it happen, rather than hoping we get the right person in office as Minister who will fight for it to happen. That is the problem. It may be totally idealistic to be even thinking that is the way we should be doing things but I believe that is the correct way. If we leave this House having worked in that way we will have achieved something. The important point is that our islands should be developing and growing after all of us have gone from this House. That should be the measure of how successful we have been.  In his reply the Minister of State covered work that other Members mentioned has happened and that has been of value to the islands. Arranmore Island has broadband as part of an Eir advertising campaign. That is a sad reflection on all of us here in this House. That is what this motion is trying to get at. Our islands should have broadband as a right, not as part of an advertising campaign for a mobile phone company. That is the sad part of it. It is a tribute to the people of Arranmore Island that they went after it and now have broadband.We got that and they have the broadband now. However, that is the problem. The people of Tory should have broadband. The people of the Aran Islands should have broadband. People all around the country should have it. It should be a measure of our society how we treat, look after and help the people on the islands. I would have great time for anybody who lives on the islands. They have a struggle. They have a hard life. However, they make it work well, without any real assistance from the State - that is the sad part about it. That is what we are trying to get at. We are trying to make sure that in the future, regardless of who the Minister is, the islands will be looked after and could be of value for all of us. That will be a measure of all of our success. That is what is important. That is what this motion is trying to get at.

Tá an chosúlacht ar an scéal go nglacfaidh formhór na Dála leis an rún seo. Cé go mbeinn sásta leis an toradh sin, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an Rialtas sásta leis an rún seo freisin. Cé nach bhfuil drogall ar bith orm a admháil go bhfuil an t-uafás oibre déanta ag an Rialtas seo agus ag Rialtais eile ar thograí éagsúla ar na hoileáin, caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil polasaí cuimsitheach ag an Rialtas dóibh. Is é sin croílár an rúin. Dúirt an tAire Stáit ina óráid go bhfuil fadhb aige. Tá sé admhaithe agam go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag an Rialtas. Níl drogall ar bith orm é sin a admháil. Glacaim leis an méid atá leagtha amach sa leasú faoin obair sin. Más mian leis an Rialtas, beidh mé sásta leasú a dhéanamh ar mo rún ionas go n-admhaítear sa rún go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta. B'fhéidir go réiteodh sé sin an fhadhb. Is í an fhadhb atá ann i ndáiríre, áfach, ná go bhfuil faitíos ar an Rialtas - b'fhéidir go bhfuil rud éigin níos tromchúisí i gceist - polasaí cuimsitheach i dtaobh na n-oileán a fhorbairt go práinneach. Is é sin an t-aon rud atá ag teastáil. Níl muinín againn as an Rialtas seo nó as aon Rialtas. Bhí coiste tras-rannach i gceist sa bhliain 1996, ach níl aon pholasaí againn go fóill. Tuigeann an tAire Stáit é sin. Tá neart oibre déanta aige agus tá a chroí san áit cheart. Perhaps I can solve the problem and not have a divisive vote. Deputy Pearse Doherty put it well. We should not divide on the islands. They are the jewels in the crown. They have shown us the way forward, not only in surviving but in a sustainable way of living. They have existed in a vacuum. Professor Ferriter has captured it beautifully in his book where he points out the contradictory policies on the islands over the years from all Governments. Governments could not make up their mind what they wanted to do with them. That is captured if one looks at the review that I mentioned originally. Between 1998 and 2004, an independent report was commissioned on the previous report. One can see why we are cynical. One of the major conclusions was the original justification for the allocation of public resources, as set out in the 1996 report, is still applicable and continued support for island communities is warranted. Imagine, after a report, they are telling us that it is warranted, as opposed to what was mentioned by Deputy Joan Burton. It is unusual for me to quote the Labour Party but I agree with her. There is a complete lack of vision. That sentence captures it, does it not? Bhí an mhéid a bhí á rá acu srianta amach is amach. It is telling us it is still warranted as opposed to addressing what the Government can do to help them survive. The clock caught up on me earlier. I wanted to refer to some of the problems on the islands. I might have misled the Minister of State on one of them. Ós rud é nach bhfuil aitheantas mar scoileanna beaga faighte ag Coláiste Naomh Eoin ar Inis Meáin agus Coláiste Ghobnait ar Inis Oírr, i gcodarsnacht leis an scoil ar Inis Mór, tá an dá scoil thíos ó thaobh líon na múinteoirí atá acu. Chomh maith leis sin, tá idirdhealú déanta i gcás na scoileanna atá ag múineadh trí Ghaeilge a thagann faoi scáth an bhoird oideachais agus oiliúna. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, faigheann na scoileanna sin níos lú airgid ná na scoileanna atá ag múineadh trí Ghaeilge nach dtagann faoi scáth an bhoird oideachais agus oiliúna. D'fhéadfainn a lán fadhbanna eile a lua. Dé réir an eolais a fuair mé inniu, bhí daoine den tuiscint go raibh €250,000 ag dul go dtí na hoileáin. Níl mé cinnte an bhfuil sé seo fíor. Tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuig an Aire Stáit leis na sonraí. Tá an chuma ar an scéal go raibh an t-airgead sin ceadaithe, ach ní fhaca aon duine é. Is mian liom pointe a dhéanamh a bhaineann le cúrsaí sláinte. Is pointe ginearálta é, ach tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach. Baineann sé leis an athbhreithniú a rinneadh sa bhliain 2017. Níor foilsíodh é go dtí gur chuir muidne agus an Teachta Ó Cuív brú damanta ar an Rialtas é a fhoilsiú. D'fhoilsíodh an tuarascáil sin sa bhliain 2018, agus neart moltaí istigh ann. An bhfuil aon airgead ann do na moltaí sin? An bhfuil na moltaí curtha i bhfeidhm? Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon airgead curtha ar leataobh do na moltaí sin. Is dóigh liom go raibh 72 moladh sa tuarascáil. I ndeireadh na Dála, ní rún radacach é an rún seo. Tá mé ag iarraidh sprioc ama a leagan amach ionas go mbeidh dáta srianta i gceist ó thaobh polasaí a fhorbairt. Má tá an Rialtas míshásta nach bhfuil na pointí maithe luaite agam sa rún, glacaim leis an gcuid sin den leasú. Is dócha nach mbeidh an vóta againn an tseachtain seo. Dá bhrí sin, tá neart ama ag an Aire Stáit machnamh a dhéanamh ar an ábhar seo. Tá go leor machnaimh le déanamh ó thaobh na n-oileán. Níl mórán ama fágtha dul i ngleic leis an laghdú daonra atá ag tarlú. Ní raibh deis agam caint faoin laghdú atá ag teacht ar líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge ar na hoileáin. I ndáiríre, táimid i gcruachás ó thaobh na Gaeilge de in ainneoin na rudaí maithe atá déanta. Impím ar an Aire Stáit gan an rún seo a chur chun vóta. Ba cheart don Rialtas glacadh leis an rún. Ba mhaith liom rudaí i bhfad níos radacach a fheiceáil. Sa rún seo, táimid ag iarraidh an Rialtas a tharraingt linn. Is mian linn a chur in iúl don Rialtas go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoin gcruachás agus faoin ngéarchéim atá ar na hoileáin. Ba cheart polasaithe i dtaobh na n-oileán a fhorbairt go práinneach. Mar fhocal scoir, ní thuigim cad atá taobh thiar de thuairim an Aire Stáit nach féidir le muintir na n-oileán bheith in aon seomra leis na hoifigigh. Más rud é nach bhfuil dóthain spáis ann do dhaoine ar an gcoiste idir-rannach, tá sé sin ceart go leor ach ba cheart athrú a dhéanamh. Sa chás sin, ba chóir don Rialtas fóram eile a fháil.
