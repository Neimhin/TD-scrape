          <p eId="para_11">I thank the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for attending today's meeting, which serves two purposes. Before we move on to Committee Stage of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, we must consider a motion that, like the aforementioned Bill, was referred to this committee by the Dáil on 22 October 2015. The motion agreed by the Dáil on that date states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">That the proposal that Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Transfer and Mutualisation of Contributions to the Single Resolution Fund as required under Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution, signed at Brussels on 21 May 2014, a copy which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 9 October 2015, be referred to the Select Sub-committee on Finance, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>b</i>) and (6)(<i>a</i>), which, not later than 10 November 2015, shall send a message to the Dáil in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I welcome the Minister for Finance and his officials to this meeting. I invite the Minister to make an opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">I thank the Select Sub-Committee on Finance for inviting me before it to discuss the Dáil motion on the proposed ratification by Ireland of the intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the Single Resolution Fund, which will enable the subsequent ratification of the intergovernmental agreement, IGA, to the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM. This Dáil motion is a component part of the overall ratification process, with the other major element being the enabling legislation in Part 2 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This legislation, which we will discuss later, is short because the Attorney General indicated that the core points of function of the Minister and the power to spend are all that need to be dealt with in primary law. The remaining commitments in the agreement are binding on the State at state level only and do not, therefore, require domestic legislation to give effect to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The requirement for the motion arises from the same Attorney General advice which indicated that as the intergovernmental agreement constitutes an international agreement under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution and, as it deals with funding and involves a charge on public funds - albeit that the contributions will be raised at national level in accordance with the bank recovery and resolution directive and the SRM regulation - Dáil approval is required. It is necessary, therefore, for the Minister for Finance to propose to move a Dáil motion accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> As members are aware, there is a requirement for the member states to ratify the IGA before 30 November in order for the Single Resolution Mechanism to come into force by 1 January 2016. Some 90% of the aggregate of the weighted votes of all participating member states is required for this to happen. As members will appreciate, the SRM is a very important part of the banking union agenda and failure to meet this deadline would be a major embarrassment for the banking union project and could undermine its credibility. Consequently, I am seeking members' support for this Dáil motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The IGA was negotiated in order to enable the Single Resolution Fund, a key element of the Single Resolution Mechanism, to be operationalised. The Single Resolution Mechanism is the second pillar of the banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, faces serious difficulties, its resolution will be managed efficiently with minimal costs to taxpayers and the real economy through a single resolution board and a Single Resolution Fund, financed by levies imposed on the banking sector. What this means in practice is that should any of our three major banks get into financial trouble, the decision about putting it into resolution will be made by the single resolution board rather than our domestic resolution authority. In addition, where bail-in of shareholders, capital instruments and eligible liabilities is insufficient to cover losses of the bank in question, then there will be access to funds from the Single Resolution Fund. This has the aim of breaking the link between banks and the sovereign and thus avoiding a repeat of the issues faced by countries during the recent financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> It should be noted that the target level for the Single Resolution Fund is at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all of the participating member states, which is to be reached at the end of eight years. This is estimated to be in the region of €55 billion. We estimate that the contribution of Irish banks to the Single Resolution Fund will be €1.8 billion over the eight years, which amounts to approximately €225 million a year. The banks' annual contributions will be calculated on the basis of their liabilities, excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted for risk. The contributions paid will be a normal operating expense for banks, including State-owned banks. A transition period of eight years to full mutualisation or pooling of the Single Resolution Fund was negotiated. This requires that contributions from the banking sectors of the participating member states be paid into national compartments or accounts within the Single Resolution Fund during the period. This was facilitated by the IGA. This structure enables the progressive mutualisation or pooling of the fund by requiring that in the event of a call upon it, the national compartment of the affected member state pays first before, if necessary, the other compartments make a contribution. As the transition proceeds, a smaller percentage is taken from the affected national compartment and a greater percentage is taken from the other compartments, until after eight years when full mutualisation or pooling occurs. From that point, any funds required for the resolution of a bank or banks will come from the Single Resolution Fund as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> In summary, therefore, the main purpose of the IGA is as follows: first, to transfer the contributions raised at national level in accordance with the bank resolution and recovery directive and the SRM regulation to the Single Resolution Fund; second, to allocate, during the eight-year transitional period, the contributions that are raised at national level to different compartments in the Single Resolution Fund corresponding to each participating member state; third, to facilitate the progressive mutualisation of these compartments in such a manner that they will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period; and, fourth, to prescribe how the Single Resolution Fund can be applied during the transition period.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> It should be noted that the reason these changes could not be accommodated within the SRM regulation is that a number of member states argued that Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union did not provide an appropriate legal basis to do so. Consequently, it was agreed that this issue should be dealt with through an intergovernmental agreement which could be formally ratified through national legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> As noted at the outset, the passing of this Dáil motion is an essential part of the ratification process for the IGA and I would appreciate the members' support for the Dáil motion that I have submitted for their consideration. I am happy to take any questions or provide any clarifications to assist the committee in regard to this matter, including any questions on the related legislative provision in Part 2 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, if members think it appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I thank the Minister for his remarks on this motion and I wish to state for the record that Fianna Fáil will be supporting it. We are supportive overall of the banking union and we want to see the Single Resolution Mechanism come into force in January of next year. On the size of the resolution fund, which is estimated to be in the region of €55 billion, I made the point previously that, on the face of it, it appears to be very small given that the cost of the Irish banking bailout alone was in excess of that. I recognise that the fund will only be accessed after the various bail-ins have been executed. That is a new provision, and it is to be welcomed, which is being provided for on a pan-European basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I have one question for the Minister. Will he clarify the position regarding the Irish contribution? I take it that it will be made by three banks contributing €1.8 billion over the eight-year period, which is approximately €225 million a year. Presumably, that is AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank or Permanent TSB.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Let us take Ulster Bank, for example, which has announced it is splitting its businesses from being an all-Ireland institution which reports to Britain to reporting on a Twenty-six Counties and Six Counties basis. Just to tease this out, let us hypothesise that the bank would take another leap, with the southern business being regulated under the Central Bank. Where would Ulster Bank be then? Would the bank automatically have to contribute to the fund, meaning there would be four banks instead of three? Is that an automatic process or would the bank have to make an application? Would the Minister have to sign an order or write to the European Central Bank about this? How does it work? Is it automatic?</p>

          <p eId="para_44">My understanding is the bank would be automatically provisioned for under the terms of the fund and the regulations appended to the fund. Whether the bank would be a contributor depends on its asset base. In the Deputy's example, the bank would automatically become a contributor if it changed the manner in which it was regulated in an Irish jurisdiction. If the bank separated completely from operations in Northern Ireland and the parent bank in Scotland, it seems it would still be sufficiently large to get caught within the regulation.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I thank everybody for their contribution. Deputy Michael McGrath referred to an issue that has been mentioned before, that the resolution fund is quite small in comparison with the possible liabilities across Europe. The primary policy position is that there will be no more bailouts by taxpayers but rather bail-ins of bank assets. In terms of a cascade of interventions, by the time we get to the resolution fund being involved, we will have gone through shareholders, junior bondholders, several categories of senior bondholders, corporate depositors and probably personal depositors in excess of €100,000. The resolution fund only kicks in after we have gone far down a cascade of assets that can be bailed in. In that context, it is reasonably significant. This was debated very hotly when it was introduced in the first instance. I am inclined to agree with Deputy McGrath. It not only looks small, it is small, and I am open to increasing it in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Perhaps the Minister would clarify some points on sections 8 and 9 pertaining to the deposit guarantee scheme. I know there has been consultation around whether low risk entities should be paying a lower rate. The credit union movement has made a strong and convincing argument that, given the risk nature of the credit unions and given that there are other funds in operation, it falls into this category and the lower rate should apply. I would appreciate comment from the Minister on the submission made by the credit union movement on the question of whether there should be consideration of a low risk sector which qualifies for a lower level of contribution.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_83">As part of the public consultation process in relation to transposition of Directive 2014/49/EU on the deposit guarantee scheme a number of submissions were received from the credit union sector, including from credit union representative bodies favouring this position. Question 7 in the consultation document asks for justification for particular sectors being considered low risk and thus qualifying for a lower level of contribution. The Department is cognisant that the credit union sector considers credit unions a lower risk sector for a number of reasons thus suggesting that credit unions should qualify for a lower level of contribution. However, the matter is still being considered and a decision will be made in the context of the broader consideration of the calculation of contribution levels, in particular the risk based element. In this regard, it should be noted that the directive allows us up to 31 May 2016 to finalise this matter. </p>

          <p eId="para_85">I believe that the credit union movement has made a very strong argument in regard to the risk profile of its institutions and the fact that they are individual entities with their own boards etc. I would be interested to hear the Minister's or the Department's view on the adequacies or inadequacies of the level of the other funds available to the credit unions and whether, if those institutions are allowed to make a lower contribution, this would create any risk in the future. Although no final decision has been made will the Minister clarify whether he is leaning towards the arguments made by the credit union movement; that it is a lower risk sector which should benefit from a lower contribution?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I am awaiting advice. The Department has until May 2016 to make a decision. The size of an institution and levels of its assets are factors when one tries to make comparisons between financial institutions. However, the really key question is the risk and it is in trying to measure the risk objectively that I will arrive at a decision. It is possible to have a credit union with a small amount of assets but with a high risk, which we have seen before. As the Deputy is aware, and it is a view shared here at this committee, Deputies in this House are generally well disposed to the credit union movement because we realise its importance. This is also a consideration.</p>

That is why I agree with the Minister's point on risk. Will the Minister indicate how much credence he will give to the fact that the Central Bank has already categorised the risk weighting of financial institutions through the PRISM system and has deemed the credit unions to be low risk whereas the other financial institutions are considered high risk? Does that classification not answer questions being posed here - that the credit unions have already been categorised by the Central Bank as, in the main, low risk entities?</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_99">In page 11, line 5, to delete “, with the approval of the Minister,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">The amendment is being made after my consultation with the ECB on the DGS part of this legislation. They have indicated that as the purpose of this provision is to reimburse the Central Bank for short-term loans it has provided to the DGS, this repayment from the Exchequer has to be automatic in order to comply with the prohibition on monetary financing as outlined in Article 123 of the Lisbon treaty. Consequently they have suggested that the words “with the approval of the Minister” be deleted, which I am proposing to do with this amendment. The members know how the ECB is chary about monetary financing and if something was done with "ministerial discretion" it would suggest that a Minister could influence monetary financing. If the term is deleted, as proposed in this amendment, it becomes automatic and therefore there is no suggestion of monetary financing.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">I have an issue with this amendment. I know we are talking about scenarios where there is enough money in the fund, but imagine a scenario where a bank gets into trouble and the Central Bank needs to provide that fund to them and there is not enough in the fund to cover it. The amendment means that regardless of the state of the Exchequer it has to pay that money within two weeks. I know the money will be reimbursed when the fund increases in value but we do not know how long that could take or whether that would be within one year or not. There are numerous other rules that can impact the relation of the Exchequer and the Central Fund. For example, how would it all play out if we had to make a contribution of a couple of billion euro to the Central Bank and the State had to wait two years for that money to be repaid? Regardless of the health of the Exchequer finances it is a blank IOU to the banks. The State will get the money back at some time in the future as the fund increases but I would be concerned about this. I understand the issues around monetary finance but I am concerned that while we talk of breaking the link this is clearly showing where the link exists between banking and the State's finances.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">That is a legitimate point of view but the banks are now heavily capitalised and one would go through a lot of other assets before this funding mechanism could be triggered. While the Deputy has identified a risk I do not think the risk is very big. Frankfurt is chary of its independence and because of the legal position under the Lisbon treaty, in particular Article 123, the ECB will not get involved in anything that it would regard as monetary financing. It would be challenged constitutionally in some jurisdictions if it did get involved. If it moved into that space it would certainly be challenged in the German constitutional court. Ireland has had long experience of tip-toeing around this when we were trying to negotiate alternative arrangements on the promissory note. The big problem all the time was that the bank was inhibited from doing anything that could be interpreted as monetary financing.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">I understand what the Minister is saying in terms of the risk being small but it is risk the Central Bank is not going to take. Indeed, the bank is willing for that risk to be placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers. That is something with which I cannot agree. It goes against the spirit of the thing, even though what we are discussing does not complete the commitment made to break the link between the sovereign and banking. The link is still there. There will be a call on the State after a series of other mechanisms and bail-ins. There is still a potential for a call on the State. A state also has the ability not to make that. This year is an automatic regardless of whether a government or parliament wants to provide the money. Basically, we are writing it into our law that if the Central Bank issues this cheque to a bank that gets into trouble in the future, we will refund the Central Bank within two weeks. That is a blank cheque which takes matters a step too far because we do not know where we will be in a number of years. Touch wood, we will not be in dire straits and hopefully an issue of this nature would not be one of huge concern. Hopefully, the fund will have enough money at a point in time to deal with all eventualities. However, there are risks. The issue is that we are putting this into law today. The officials in the Department of Finance are well aware of the ECB's rules on monetary financing. I do not expect that people are unaware of these rules, given that it is one of the biggest issues we have been discussing in the State around a number of matters including the promissory note. Nevertheless, this Bill, which passed scrutiny by the Attorney General, threw up the issue relating to the phrase "with the approval of the Minister". I presume that somewhere within the Department there was a view that this phrase could be inserted and that there would still be compliance in the context of the ECB's role regarding the prohibition on monetary financing. I am reluctant to approve the deletion of these words.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I ask the Minister to clarify how much is in the deposit guarantee fund at present. I also ask him to clarify that the circumstances in which this scenario would arise would be those in which the fund was exhausted, whereupon the Central Bank would have to use its resources to make a payment to depositors under a compensation event and to state that it would only be in such a scenario that the Central Fund would be obliged to reimburse the Central Bank and make good the deficit. Is that what we are talking about?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Yes. The figure the Deputy is seeking is €380 million. Deputy Pearse Doherty is right that the phrase "with the approval of the Minister" was included in the original draft. Like many matters where Europe and the European Central Bank are involved, we were obliged - after we published the Bill - to have consultations with the latter. It was quite convincing in its argument that to allow that phrase in would contravene Article 123 of the Lisbon treaty and that it would be deemed to be monetary financing if there was a ministerial discretion over the repayment of the money. That is why it was changed. We were legally constrained to change. However, the Deputy was right that our opening position was to put in a discretionary clause.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">How will this impact on the other rules in terms of the fiscal treaty? How does it work in the context of expenditure benchmarks and all of those types of rules? For example, if this were to arise this month and there was a call of €500 million that had to be repaid from the Central Fund to the Central Bank because of a payment, what would happen in relation to budgetary arithmetic and how would it be accounted for?</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I do not see a crossover into other areas. It is obviously very complex but the essential idea about monetary financing is that the central banking system in Frankfurt or any of its components like the Central Bank in Dublin could not financially assist the Exchequer because one would then get involved in monetary financing of a fiscal position. If money was owed to the Central Bank by the Exchequer and the Minister had discretion not to pay it, that would be deemed to be monetary financing and to contravene the Lisbon treaty according to the ECB. There is merit to that argument. That is where we are. If there is a liability, the obvious thing is to levy the banking system to make good anything the Exchequer loses in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">In relation to the ECB, I have mentioned that there were conversations and discussions going on, but is this really monetary finance? The Central Bank would get its money back from the fund in any event and it is just a case of who has to put up with the pain until the fund reaches a point where it can pay for any outlays that have been made. The Central Bank has involved itself in some of these activities in the past through different mechanisms and the promissory note is one example. As such, how is this monetary finance? If it does not fall on the Exchequer to repay this, could not the fund directly repay the Central Bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_112">It is like arguments about what certain articles of the Constitution mean. I remember an experience when I was in the Department of Justice and I asked the Secretary General about what a particular article in the Constitution meant. He very succinctly answered that it meant whatever the Supreme Court decided it meant. It is the same with monetary financing. It is monetary financing if the ECB decides it is and is supported by the legal authorities. That is the position and it is the one we found ourselves in notwithstanding that we initially had a different view when we laid out the original draft. We take the advice now. The ECB says it is monetary financing and is supported by legal opinion to that effect. Our Attorney General does not challenge that opinion and, as such, we amend.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">My question is on amendment No. 17. What effect will this directive have on existing insurance companies that do not fall under the new regime? How does the new regime differ from the current regime?</p>

          <p eId="para_158">No difference, I am told. The entire reason for this Bill is the entry into force on 1 January 2016 of the Solvency II regime. This is a new EU-wide regulatory regime for the insurance sector. The directive repeals the EU directives underpinning the current insurance regulatory regime but the directive also excludes certain undertakings from the new regime. In order to ensure there are no insurance undertakings operating in Ireland from 1 January, unregulated, we have provided for that regulation by way of this Bill. This section seeks to continue the current regulatory regime for such undertakings.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">The insurance undertakings to be regulated under this Bill should be entitled to continue to transfer their portfolios if required and it was considered simplest to allow them to do so under the same rules pertaining to those insurance undertakings governed by Solvency II.
