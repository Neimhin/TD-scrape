Members may be aware that the mother of Deputy Higgins passed away earlier this morning. On my own behalf and that of the joint committee, I wish to express my sympathy to Deputy Higgins and his family at this difficult time. Is it agreed to note this formally in the minutes? Agreed.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	We now turn to No. 7, terms of reference of the sub-committee on global taxation and discussion on the motions submitted. The joint committee has a number of motions before it for discussion this afternoon and with the agreement of members, I wish to conclude this part of the meeting no later than 3.50 p.m. The motions referring to the sub-committee on global taxation specifically deal with the terms of reference conferred on the sub-committee by the joint committee. My recollection and understanding from previous lengthy debates prior to establishing the sub-committee was the joint committee had agreed the priority now was for it to examine the international taxation architecture and how Ireland interacts therewith. The effect was to build a report that had standing and, having re-examined the tapes of those earlier discussions, I can confirm the joint committee agreed this would be the case. It was agreed that in the first instance, the sub-committee would engage with the policy platform. This includes the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the OECD and policy, academic and taxation experts. It was then for the committee to decide on its next step, once this initial phase concluded. Deputy Pearse Doherty specifically requested that witnesses not be confined to what has been termed "forces of the State" or forces deemed to be representative of what is termed "statist" views. It was agreed that the joint committee would invite independent experts to brief the sub-committee on its examination. However, it was clearly agreed not to invite the multinationals. The joint committee is now returning to this issue and the motions were received in the following order: the motion tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty, followed by motions tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Higgins. I also note Deputy Dara Murphy submitted an amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion. While I will take the motions in the order in which they were submitted, the motion from Deputy Pearse Doherty and the amendment submitted by Deputy Dara Murphy will be disposed of first, followed by the motions of Deputies Boyd Barrett and Higgins, in that order. For the information of members, if a motion is agreed to, the joint committee must make a report on the matter to the Houses. I now call on Deputy Pearse Doherty to move his motion.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	I move:That the Sub-Committee on Global Taxation may invite, if it sees it as appropriate, and after hearing from the OECD, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance, and the other named individuals discussed at the Sub-Committee on Global Taxation meeting of 26 June, other witnesses before the committee.In November 2012, in a formal proposal to this joint committee, I requested that it examine the issue of multinational corporation tax and the fact that some multinational companies were not paying the appropriate level of corporation tax. Members subsequently have witnessed investigations or hearings in both Britain and the United States and in particular, the damaging reference in the United States in which this State was named as a tax haven, together with countries such as Bermuda, which has been damaging to our reputation. However, it does not deflect from the imperative that this issue must be discussed in our own home territory, where these companies are incorporated. It took six months for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the proposal I made in November and to agree to examine this issue. It has been my clear intention, which I never kept from the joint committee, that as part of this, members should invite multinationals to appear before the sub-committee to seek their views on where Ireland sits in respect of multinational corporation tax. It is my clear view that the sub-committee to be established and which met for the first time last week, should not be barred from asking the multinational companies to appear before it and to provide information or evidence as to their perception of the corporation tax rule in the State. However, from the previous meetings and discussions it is clear that a number of members of this joint committee wish at all costs to avoid seeing the multinational companies appear before the sub-committee, including companies such as Apple and Google, which have been named in international hearings. It would discredit this committee's work to invite, as members have agreed at the sub-committee meeting, 17 different individuals, four from what one might call State groups, namely, the OECD, the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, as well as 13 or 14 academics, without asking a single multinational corporation. Members must remember that some of these multinational corporations, such as, for example, Apple Operations International, have been named and in the case of the latter, has given evidence voluntarily to a Senate committee in the United States that for four years, it recorded profits of â‚¬29.9 billion, which equates to 30% of Apple's entire global profits. It is incorporated in Ireland and does not pay a single cent of tax in this State or in any other jurisdiction internationally. Moreover, it employs no one in this State. As for having a discussion that will take a number of weeks, possibly a number of months, to deal with this issue without asking any multinational company to come before it, I note the amendment to my motion seeks to have the committee finish its work and make a report and thereafter have a discussion or possible recommendation that witnesses be brought in at a later stage. It is my view, from listening to members of this joint committee, that they wish at all costs to avoid having the likes of Apple, Google or Facebook appearing before the committee. However, this would be folly for members and would discredit the type of work they are doing. If Apple is willing to come before the United States Senate and if other companies are willing to attend hearings in Britain, members should be willing to request, if it is deemed appropriate by the sub-committee, such companies to appear before them and answer questions as to whether they consider the corporation tax laws in this State and internationally to be appropriate or whether they are using the corporation tax rules to create bigger dividends for their shareholders at the expense of the Exchequer here. Consequently, I wish to push my motion and feel very passionate about this issue. As stated previously, I raised the original motion more than seven months ago and setting up this type of sub-committee with a bar on its ability to invite multinational companies before it makes no sense or logic to me at present. Members should not be afraid of asking questions as these corporations are major entities. I do not single out Apple, although it has been singled out in the United States Senate. Other corporations, which are not availing of such loopholes, should also be invited to appear before the sub-committee to seek their views. However, these corporations have more revenue than does the entire State and their means are greater than those of this State. They are big enough and well capable of appearing before a hearing of the sub-committee to answer questions on evidence they have given, which is already in the public domain, in the United States Senate. Other companies, which are complying completely with the laws - as is Apple because the laws allow it to do this - also should be invited to explain to members of the sub-committee their view, from a multinational's perspective, of how Ireland's corporation tax rules sit with them. It is fine and well to have the State bodies and the academics here to give their views but the missing piece of the jigsaw concerns the multinational corporations. A refusal to do this sends out a terrible signal, both domestically and internationally, that we do not wish to deal with the issues that have been raised at an international level. Moreover, not only is this issue being raised in the United States and Britain but it also is being raised by senior officials and Ministers in the Australian Parliament and has been referenced right across the globe.

It beggars belief that we could discuss global and multinational tax architecture and its relationship to this State and our role in it without asking some of the key players based in this country to come before the joint committee to express their views on the issue. This does not make sense. We are asking people who are at one remove to give us what is supposedly expert analysis of the issue, rather than questioning those who are at the centre of the issue, namely, the corporations. Nobody knows more about this issue than the multinational companies, although it remains to be seen whether they will provide honest answers.

The companies at the centre of these allegations are based here and Ireland has been directly accused in the United States, Britain and elsewhere of facilitating aggressive tax avoidance by multinational companies. It defies belief that there does not appear to be a willingness to discuss increasing taxes on these companies when the country is beggared with taxation and austerity measures. That is bad enough but the fact that we cannot even talk about it-----

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "That the Sub-Committee on Global Taxation" and substitute the following:"shall report to the Joint Committee following its consideration of evidence from the OECD; the Department of Finance; the Revenue Commissioners; the Minister for Finance, and other relevant taxation and academic experts on the global corporate/multinational taxation architecture and Ireland's relationship with that tax architecture. Such report to recommend, if it sees it as appropriate, as to further enquires and proposed witnesses."Multinational companies come to Ireland for a variety of reasons, not least our access to the eurozone, our well-educated workforce, the cost of doing business and the taxation system. There is merit in the joint committee seeking to discover and engage in a process of understanding how our tax infrastructure works in an international context. My amendment largely mirrors the motion tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty that the joint committee should invite before it representatives of the OECD, which is carrying out a study of world taxation practices, the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and also the Minister. The sub-committee had a discussion on whether other groups should appear before it. If it is to complete its work quickly and with clarity, it must have clear terms of reference.  No representative of a small company or large multinational should be put in a position of having to come to the House to discuss how it engages with our taxation system. To do so would create difficulties for the company from a competition point of view. It should be noted also that we are competing with other countries as we seek to attract multinational business. Reference was made to part of a company that does not employ anyone in Ireland. The company in question employs 4,500 people, many of whom live in my constituency of Cork North Central and the Chairman's constituency. To add to Deputy Doherty's motion, essentially by having other named experts in international taxation appear before the sub-committee, would help members understand the issue and make recommendations to the joint committee on what actions it should take subsequently. It is important to have such clarity and I propose the amendment to this end.

It would be unbelievable if the sub-committee were to fail to do due diligence by having representatives of the OECD and Department of Finance, as well as the Minister for Finance, come before it. Such meetings would allow it to obtain a clear and comprehensive understanding of the issues, report back to the joint committee and, if appropriate, add additional witnesses. My greatest fear is that members will engage in a form of showboating. The sub-committee has work to do in carrying out distinct research and producing clear recommendations. If it is appropriate, we should have further witnesses come before either the full committee or the sub-committee once the latter has completed its work. I support the amendment.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	I oppose Deputy Murphy's amendment for a number of reasons. To respond to Deputy Humphreys, there is no suggestion that we would speak to representatives of any multinational corporations before the Minister for Finance, officials from the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and OECD and academic experts have appeared before the sub-committee. It is proposed to have these witnesses appear first and thereafter representatives of the multinational companies would come before the sub-committee. Despite the fact that I have been very open in stating I want representatives of some of the multinational companies that have been named in various hearings to come before the sub-committee, I would also like representatives of multinational companies that have not been accused of anything to come before us. To get to the nub of the issue, the joint committee has asked a sub-committee to do a report on corporation tax as it applies to multinational companies. The origin of this request was the motion the joint committee passed in November. The sub-committee's hearings can be structured and shaped in different ways. International issues arise regarding companies located in Ireland which are aggressively involved in evading tax. That is the reality. We are now asking a sub-committee to do a report without allowing it to question any multinational company before the report is submitted to the joint committee. If we proceed with this approach, the process will be a farce.  All of us wish to protect jobs and I agree with Deputy Dara Murphy's comments on the need to do so. Sinn FÃ©in does not seek an increase in corporate tax but we must deal with realities. We know there are two companies which are incorporated in Ireland and not tax resident in this State or anywhere else in the world. One of them does not have any employees in the State and even if we were to raise corporation tax to the roof, we would not get any money from it because it does not pay a cent of tax here or elsewhere in the world. This is at a time when people are being put to the pin of their collar by cuts and austerity.We know from the evidence that this multinational freely and willingly gave the US Senate information that it made a profit of â‚¬29.9 billion through a company that is located in Ireland but does not employ anyone. It has not paid a penny in tax to this State or any other state internationally. Another subsidiary of Apple, ASI, made a pre-tax profit of â‚¬38 billion in three years and paid â‚¬21 million in tax to this State. How can we look anyone out there in the eye and defend the austerity measures being introduced by this Government if we are unwilling to bring before this committee companies that are not paying their fair share of tax in this State? It seems we are going to compile a report about multinational corporations without asking of those corporations their views on these matters. I am fundamentally opposed to this amendment because it is clear from views expressed at this committee and at the sub-committee in private session that there is a complete and utter unwillingness to hint at the idea of bringing in these multinational corporations. This amendment is being dressed up as a means of putting a report together, with the possibility of making a recommendation at a later stage to bring in the multinationals. It is clear from views that have been expressed previous to this meeting that such action is not on the agenda of Deputies in this forum. It can only be presented as a case of this committee protecting multinational firms that pay no tax here, do not employ anyone and pay no other tax internationally. It makes an absolute mockery of this committee.

It has been suggested that the sub-committee does not want to bring in multinational corporations and is blocking that in some way. I wrote to the Chairman recently to request the establishment of this sub-committee. My attempts to gain a position on my own committee were unsuccessful, but I will be there for all of the hearings. Having requested the sub-committee's establishment, I do not doubt that multinational corporations will be brought in at some point. I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that multinational corporations are experts in a kind of tax avoidance. We need to be very clear in public session about the difference between evasion and avoidance.

We are talking here about tax avoidance. Deputy Murphy's proposal was agreed by this committee in private session. It is regrettable that we are back discussing it in public session. It was very clearly agreed - this is laid out in Deputy Murphy's amendment - that this would be a multi-phase piece of work. We agreed that the first thing we would do is understand exactly how the system works. We said we would listen to independent parties that would be able to lay out for the sub-committee and therefore for the joint committee the mechanics of the different types of international laws in Ireland and abroad that are potentially being used for tax avoidance. We agreed that after we had completed this phase of our work and compiled a report on it, and ensuring the full joint committee and potentially the Oireachtas had been given time to digest the report, we would move into the next phase of the process, during which the multinational corporations as a group would be brought in. For me, there is no question of trying to avoid bringing multinational corporations before this committee or before the sub-committee. I think Deputy Murphy's proposal sets out the most sensible way to proceed. The process he has proposed for meeting the multinational corporations is the process that would best equip us to engage with them. I would like to support the amendment tabled by the Deputy.

I find it regrettable that we are back here this afternoon. Having listened to the tapes, I have reaffirmed my interpretation of what happened in private session. At last week's select committee meeting, different people put a different interpretation on what was agreed. We are here this afternoon to clarify the interpretation of that first meeting. It has been mentioned that committees in other jurisdictions have compiled their own reports. They have done so for their own reasons, in particular, their own national reasons. Any work that will be done by this committee will be done for our own reasons. We will not react in a crisis-driven way to reports coming out of other jurisdictions. Our work will suit our purpose. I can summarise what was agreed the first time we discussed this in private session by referring to a point I made on that occasion. If one wants to discuss the offside rule because there are accusations that companies are playing offside, one should bring in FIFA and UEFA rather than Manchester United or Chelsea. That was the point I made at the time. However, the purpose of this meeting is to clarify what the select committee should do. We are back here this afternoon on that basis. We have covered this issue at length. We are all very busy. I am busy and my colleagues are busy. There is a certain level of frustration about the downtime, as I call it, which is involved in having to go over background work that has been done already. This work was done and agreed, but we are back here this evening to clarify it. On that basis, we need to give final and utter clarification on the work of the select committee. In keeping with Standing Orders, I propose that Deputy Dara Murphy's amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion be agreed. Is that agreed? I believe the motion has been carried.

That is the exact comment. That was in the context of a discussion of whether we should bring in representatives of multinationals. We should be crisis-driven because our public finances are in the most severe crisis they have ever faced.That crisis faced by our public finances is precisely the reason we need to have the multinationals that have been accused internationally of engaging in aggressive tax avoidance in before this committee to answer questions about that. We owe it to the citizens of this country who are being crucified with unjust and unfair austerity measures and taxes, which they cannot afford to pay, to bring in super profitable, super wealthy multinationals against which serious allegations are being made about their failure to pay their fair share in taxation. We owe it to the people of this country to do that. I must comment on the unprecedented mobilisation of the political establishment in this country, reflected in this committee today, where Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna FÃ¡il and some Independents have banded together to protect the multinationals in this country from even being asked questions about their tax affairs. It is simply extraordinary. Can we not at least explore this? The idea that we would look into global multinational tax architecture and how it relates to this country without inviting in the key subjects of that discussion, the multinationals, to ask them questions about their tax affairs beggars belief. It makes a farce of this committee and would outrage the people of this country if they were to find out that we could not even ask them those simple questions. In recent times there has been much talk about group-think and how group-think has led us to the disastrous situation in which we are now. I have never seen a more profound example of group-think, where one is not allowed question the consensus, than what we are seeing around the issue of corporate tax and the multinationals. One cannot even ask questions, never mind change the policy. It is beyond belief.  All we are asking is that they should be part of this investigation. It is absolutely clear that the proposer of the amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion and those who are almost certainly going to vote against this motion do not want the multinationals brought in here. If Deputy Donnolly was right in saying this was always envisaged, what is the problem with my motion proposing that it would be part of the remit of the committee? That is all it states, it does not state in what order. It states that it would be part of a remit of a committee looking into multinational taxation and its relationship to this country that at some point we will ask those people in. We could do it at the end of the phase or at whatever point we consider acceptable. What those who are opposing these motions are trying to do is to prevent that happening. That is shameful. It is a conspiracy of silence. It is a cover-up of an issue of immense importance. Some estimates indicate there is â‚¬80 trillion of these profits floating around the world. If even a small fraction of that were to go back into the revenue of cash-starved states like ours, the United States, Britain, Europe, which are desperately in need of funds and finances to re-kickstart their economies, it would be helpful, but the fact is that we cannot even talk about it. We cannot ask these people questions. We are shivering with fear in the face of the multinationals, so much so that we cannot even bring them in to ask questions. It beggars believe. I intend to press the motion. Regardless of what this committee does I intend to press this issue and keep pressing it at every possible opportunity.

At least one speaker who voted against the previous two motions has suggested that it is the intention of the sub-committee to bring in the multinationals. Let me be clear, if we vote against this motion, the view of the committee is that no multinationals are to be brought in at this stage. It will be an option that could be a recommendation of a report when published but the committee will not be able to request multinationals to appear before it prior to it concluding its work and reports to the joint committee. There is the famous phrase, "who fears to speak". The question for this committee is: "Who fears to ask?". We appear to be paralysed by fear in terms of asking questions of multinational companies. In my view, what we are doing is holding an inquiry or hearings into multinational corporation tax but not inviting in the main players to ask them questions. This is the equivalent of having a banking inquiry without inviting in the bank officials. Can anyone imagine if this committee were tasked with holding the banking inquiry and it decided to invite in the Ministers present on the night, the regulator and, perhaps, the-----

That is exactly what this committee is doing here today. In my view, it is ridiculous that we are having a discussion on multinational corporation tax and this committee is so paralysed with fear it will not even suggest that we ask questions of any multinational company, which information they have voluntarily and willingly given to other parliaments in other jurisdictions.

What is proposed is that the committee undertake the preparatory work first and then consider who it might be necessary to invite in. We are all aware of the conversation around people showboating and so on in a banking inquiry. What is proposed is that adequate research would be carried out before proceeding. The sub-committee needs to do its preparatory work first and then take the matter further.

There is no suggestion, nor should there be, of any wrongdoing by any multinational conducting its business in this country. The OECD, which will shortly appear before the new committee, is conducting an international investigation into the global tax infrastructure. We will be able to question and report on that basis. This issue has been addressed on so many occasions, we are now going around in circles.

Some of us believe that we are talking about wrongdoing. However one defines it, aggressive tax avoidance by large multinationals is wrong. Whether or not it is illegal is of secondary interest to me and, I suspect, to the majority of people both here and abroad. People think it is morally wrong that corporations can make obscene profit levels and pay little or no tax, when ordinary people are screwed to the wall. That is why this is a very important issue for people. Some of us believe that addressing this issue is the key to dealing with the European and global economic crisis. Not everybody agrees with that but some of us happen to believe it. This Government has defended a lot of its actions in recent times on the basis of safeguarding, improving and rehabilitating our international reputation. Both the Government and Fianna FÃ¡il are opposing us on this matter but our international reputation has been seriously damaged by the allegation that we are operating as a tax haven to facilitate aggressive corporate tax avoidance by these multinationals. Our reputation is being further damaged by the refusal of this committee to even bring these guys in for questioning. We are on our knees before these people. This is my last point. I wish to pass my condolences to Deputy Higgins on the death of his mother. However, if he were here I know he would say that this is an example of the dictatorship of the corporate markets. That is what it is and I do not think we should submit to that dictatorship. I know Deputy Higgins would say that if he were here.

The Deputies will have three minutes each.

I wish to convey my condolences to Deputy Higgins. I was not aware that he had lost his mother. Nobody has suggested that the due diligence to which Deputy Kevin Humphreys referred would not be done. It is self-evident that the OECD and other bodies must be questioned to ascertain information from them. Anybody who happens to be watching this session will simply have reconfirmed for them the state of paralysis and denial within the Irish political system. Anybody tuning in would quite rightly ask why the multinationals are not being brought in. Without prejudice to what they might say, I do not wish to make a judgment on guilt or innocence, or on the extent of tax avoidance or otherwise. This has been a matter of international public concern. If we wanted to make a show of weakness on behalf of Oireachtas committees, members have done that quite magnificently here today.

There are suggestions that people are trying to protect multinationals and that members of this committee are afraid of questioning them. As someone who wrote to the Chairman and asked for this sub-committee to be established, I am certainly not afraid of asking questions of any multinational corporations in Ireland. I doubt if any members of this committee are afraid of doing so. This is not about protecting multinationals or being afraid of them, it is a procedural issue. The motion that Deputy Dara Murphy tabled, which is what we agreed in private session, is that we would do this in the most sensible and effective way. I only wanted to respond to some strong language that is being thrown around to the effect that members of this committee are somehow afraid of doing the good work of the Oireachtas. Unfortunately, this sort of thing will make it more difficult for the sub-committee to do what it needs to do. This committee has shown - for example, by inviting in the public interest directors - that people with a wide variety of backgrounds and different political views are capable of working together towards a common consensus. Once we fully understand this complicated set of international taxation laws and movements of money, it is my intention to request that this committee should bring in the multinationals. It is a question of process.

I spoke on this matter when the sub-committee met and my views have not changed. I agree with virtually everything Deputy Donnelly has said. As far as I am concerned, the focus of the sub-committee's work is on policy issues. It is dealing with taxation architecture, the corporation tax code in Ireland as it relates to multinationals, and the relationship between our taxation system and others. Those are the key issues. The taxation relationship between the Irish State and individual multinationals is managed by the Revenue. Therefore, direct contact between the State and multinationals on tax issues is channelled through the Revenue Commissioners. I am not ruling out asking the multinationals in at a later date, but we need to do our work first. Once we get down to it, we will quickly distil it down to the key issues. Most of us with a cursory knowledge of the subject know what the key issues are, so let us get into it as soon as possible, and deal with the individual companies later.

I am happy to report to this committee that it has, in my view, been a very successful one for the Department of Finance and it has, in many respects, exceeded our expectations when we were planning the Presidency in 2012. I wish to give the committee an overview of the achievements of the Presidency in the past six months. We had six formal ECOFIN Councils and one highly successful informal ECOFIN in Dublin. Much work was achieved in these Councils in terms of getting agreement on specific files and on managing the business of the Council. However, the Presidency is more than achieving agreement at ECOFIN - important as that is - it is also carried on in work in Council working parties, engagement with the European Parliament and engaging with the European institutions. There is also the practical organisational work which often occurs behind the scenes. Without all this work we would not have had such a successful Presidency. The aims of the Presidency for the ECOFIN Council were set out in our list of priorities published at the end of 2012. We set ourselves a number of objectives under the broad thematic heading of stability, jobs and growth. We achieved much of what we set out to achieve last January, and I consider that what we proposed to achieve at that stage was, by any standards, an ambitious package of objectives. Indeed, in financial services we have achieved significantly more than was planned. We planned to carry out work on economic governance â€“ principally in the management of the European semester process and in seeking agreement on the two pack of economic surveillance measures for the eurozone. In financial services we prioritised work on the banking union proposals designed to break the link between the financial sector and the sovereign. We targeted agreement on the capital requirements directive, the single supervisory mechanism, and bank resolution and recovery.We had the Council agree 2014 budget guidelines. On 19 February, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, presented to the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control the Council's recommendation on the discharge to be given to the Commission for the implementation of the 2011 budget.  One notable difference between this Presidency and previous Presidencies has been the significant role the European Parliament plays as co-legislator in many policy areas. Much work has been done at administrative and political level in negotiating with the Parliament on a wide range of policy areas. The Irish Presidency worked well with the Parliament in achieving the objectives of the Presidency and it is important that a level of engagement is maintained with the Parliament at political and official level. I also note the engagement between the DÃ¡il and European Parliament, which is an important development.  In running a Presidency, there is always the possibility that national interests may not receive the appropriate attention they deserve and we have worked hard with regard to this scenario. We have focused on national issues while at the same time concluding a successful Presidency. We have managed to focus on national interests where there is a European dimension. For example, we delivered a deal on the promissory note issue, secured the extension of maturities on EFSF and EFSM loans and kept open the possibility of retrospection in the framework for the ESM in terms of direct bank recapitalisations. This latter objective is important for Ireland.  The Presidency also has an international dimension. I represented the European Union at the G20 and IMF-World Bank meetings. This allowed me to support progress on issues conducive to renewed growth at EU level and enabled me to promote confidence in Ireland among our international partners in the European recovery process.  The theme of our Presidency was stability, jobs and growth. In our short six-month period, we consider that we have helped advance the European agenda to set the conditions for a more stable currency and a better financial system with greater credibility that can begin to lend to all businesses. In terms of improved economic governance, measures to be implemented at national level include the full implementation of country-specific recommendations from the European semester process for the relevant member states. This includes the pursuit of differentiated and growth-friendly consolidation, the restoration of normal lending to the economy and the promotion of competitiveness.  While financial and economic stability is important and a precondition for growth, it is not sufficient to drive economic recovery. Europe needs to continue to address the legacy associated with the financial crisis and to be more forward-thinking and take action to drive a reinvigorated growth strategy. Given the limited availability of public financial resources and constraints on bank lending as a result of post-crisis deleveraging, it is now essential to explore how the financial system - markets, institutions and financial instruments - can be used to channel available savings towards the financing of infrastructure projects and enterprise, particularly small and medium enterprises. The recent European Commission Green Paper on Long Term Financing of the European Economy
is an important development as it proves that this is a key policy issue for Europe. Arising out of discussions at the informal ECOFIN in Dublin, a high level expert group on long-term finance and SMEs has been established. This expert group is co-chaired by Mr. John Moran, Secretary General of my Department, and will publish its report in the autumn. We have also been active in supporting changes to the role of the European Investment Bank in terms of its ability to expand its lending and promote growth across all member states.  A successful Irish Presidency has been important in helping to restore and enhance our reputation in the European Union and across member states. It demonstrates that we are serious and capable of achieving change in many areas of European Union legislation and policy, which benefits all its citizens, not just those in Ireland. It also demonstrates that a small member state can impact and influence the European agenda, which is of great importance to Ireland. I hope we can build on a successful Presidency to increase our influence in Europe. Our influence on the European agenda has been achieved through the Presidency's facilitation of agreement in the Council and with the Parliament. No Presidency can impose solutions on either the Council or the Parliament. It cannot impose its own views on other member states or the European institutions. In the role of the Presidency, it is necessary to deal with conflicting interests and opinions and broker solutions with which all parties can live. We have a very good track record after six months in negotiating and seeking agreement.  I thank all the officials in my Department for the contribution they have made to the success of the Presidency. This contribution is evident across policy and operational areas, all of which have contributed to its success. I also thank all those officials in the Irish Permanent Representation in Brussels who contributed significantly to the success of the past six months. I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.

As a member of the Opposition, I am either detached or semi-detached from the Irish Presidency, but it appears the Minister and his officials did an excellent job during the Presidency, even if one or two things did not go exactly as they may have hoped. The Minister, in particular, has been operating in a highly constrained environment in ECOFIN given the domestic politics at play in Germany, where a general election is imminent. I heard repeatedly from officials in Brussels that the Minister and his officials did a great job. Those with whom I spoke were very impressed with the Irish team at a political and an official level. I wish to acknowledge this publicly. On the bank resolution mechanism, the technical note from the European Union is dense and complicated. I ask the Minister to request that his officials prepare for the joint committee a note explaining exactly how a resolution would proceed. Phase one involves a bail-in of 8%, phase two involves a 5% bail-in, and so forth. It would be useful if the Department provided one or two worked examples of a theoretical bank entering a resolution process, as it would help us to understand this complicated mechanism. Before the most recent ECOFIN meeting, I understand the Minister's position was that he would seek to have small depositors take precedence over senior bondholders. I agree with that position, although the Minister will have to forgive me if I understood his position incorrectly. I was not able to figure out from the technical note whether this objective was achieved. Was it achieved, or will normal depositors and senior bondholders continue to be placed on an equal legal footing?

The bank resolution mechanism is complex because it is a new concept and new terms are being used. I will ask my officials to provide the Deputy with a user-friendly paper which breaks down the various ideas. I will try to simplify the process and perhaps it should be considered in the following manner. The Deputy will remember the concept of an institution being "too big to fail". The reason this concept was in the public consciousness, especially in the United States, was that a bank was considered to be too big to fail when its failure would bring down the sovereign. The opening position is that banks may no longer be too big to fail, which means not every bank that goes bust must be resolved. Instead of calling on taxpayers to bail out banks, the assets of the impaired bank will be used as a bail-in mechanism to liquify the assets to repair the hole in the bank in question. That is the general principle.  In proceeding with a bail-in mechanism, the assets covered by the bail-in are placed in a hierarchy, starting with the equity, followed by junior bondholders and, thereafter, senior bondholders. A guarantee will apply to deposits of up to â‚¬100,000, which will be sacrosanct and, therefore, exempt from the bail-in, and preference will be given to other depositors.To distinguish between exemption and preference, up to â‚¬100,000 is guaranteed and exempt and preference would apply to individuals with deposits over â‚¬100,000 which would have preference, for example, over corporate deposits. The idea is that preference would be given to what, in law, is called "natural persons" with deposits over â‚¬100,000, that preference would also be given to SMEs with money on deposit and that the first line of deposits would be the corporate deposits of large corporations with large holdings. That is the way it runs on the deposit side.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	They will. The legal link and the pari passu link between senior bondholders and depositors has been broken and all deposits will move to a lower level in the hierarchy of bail-in assets, as we discussed previously, but within that hierarchy the position has been nuanced and refined more and a differentiation has been made between natural persons with big deposits, over â‚¬100,000, and SMEs as against corporations. We can get the paper that has been requested. In regard to the figures of 8%, 5% and so on, if a bank is bust and needs a rescue and cannot manage without help, there is a resolution authority which organises the bail-in. If the level of impairment is 8% of its balance sheet, all of the rescue will be by bail-in. If the level of impairment exceeds 8% of its balance sheet, it will move to the next phase, the next 5% of its balance sheet; an amount equivalent to the next 5% of its balance sheet can be accessed elsewhere - a resolution fund the sovereign might have or the ESM. In a very bad situation such as in the case of AIB, where the level of impairment exceeds 8%, plus 10%, and
there is still a level of impairment beyond 13% of its balance sheet, it again goes back to a bail-in and the resolution authority might return to the senior bondholders for an additional haircut or the ESM could be directly accessed at that point. In the first phase, in the case of the figure of 5%, there would be indirect involvement by the ESM because the sovereign would have to apply. However, for the tranche beyond the figure of 13%, if such a case arises in extremis, the application could be made by the institution directly to the ESM if it required recapitalisation. That is the general position. I am explaining it very simply, but we will get a paper for the Deputy which is not quite as simple but not as complex as a technical paper.

I am aware that it has required much personal commitment in the past six months and in the period leading up to the start of the Presidency. I acknowledge all of the hard work done and the progress made on a number of important fronts. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly raised the point on which I was about to start concerning the common resolution framework which the Minister has explained. In respect of deposits above â‚¬100,000, the Minister has explained that there are layers beyond this amount. Will he clarify the relationship between the different layers of deposits over â‚¬100,000 and senior bondholders? Is it the case that the senior bondholders would take a hit first in all cases and only after this has been exhausted that any depositor would be involved in burden sharing? An explanation would be helpful in that regard. Will the Minister clarify if senior bondholders would take the hit first before any deposit over â‚¬100,000 would be affected?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	96	The hierarchy is equity, subordinate bondholders and senior bondholders. If one has to go further for additional assets, one goes to the depositors, for whom â‚¬100,000 is guaranteed. On the same line preference is given to larger deposits of natural persons and SMEs. What is part of the bail-in at that point is corporate deposits.

I compliment the Minister on getting it in place. I understand it will be 2018 before the bail-in procedures are fully applied. Will they apply in the case of banks that fail and also banks that require capital if there is a capital adequacy issue?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	100	Both. Often in the European Union, once a mechanism is put in place, it can be used informally. If bail-in becomes the new rule, it will be very hard for a Government to go back to a set of taxpayers and say it wants their money to bail out an institute. I do not think countries will have the legal arrangements in place and everything will be done until about 2016. There will be a gap between 2016 and 2018.

It will be transposed from the EU directive.

It clarifies also the potential role of the ESM, depending on the scale of the issue within a bank, whether it is beyond the threshold figure of 8%.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	104	It builds in to the directive the manner in which the ESM can be accessed. One must think of the European Union. There are 18 countries in the eurozone. The countries that are not in it have banking systems that lend and borrow in the eurozone and right across the European Union. There are banks that work only in their own sovereign area, banks that work in the eurozone and banks that work in the eurozone and the countries outside it. A common set of rules is needed for the 27 member states and it has to work across all of them. Given that some are not using the currency, they have their own mechanisms for resolving bank issues. They had large resolution funds, for example, in Sweden. We had to vote on the issue of flexibility to allow for countries such as Sweden and the United Kingdom to ensure a harmonised system for the 27 member states and also an element of flexibility that would apply to all but where the original demand came from those that were out rather than in.

I listened carefully to the Minister's comments when he said it would relate to all major or systematically important banks and that there would be differentiation, depending on the size and significance of the banks involved. Will he translate for us what it will mean in Ireland's case in respect of the direct regulation of the pillar banks, for example, Permanent TSB, and other institutions? Will they all be categorised as being systemically important and falling under ECB regulation when it is fully up and running?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	106	There will be a common rule book and common protocols which, in the first instance, will be directed from Frankfurt. There will be a common set of rules and protocols which, in terms of regulation, will apply to all banks. Some banks will be regulated by the domestic regulator, while others will be regulated directly by the European regulator. If I recall it correctly - I will check with my officials - every country must have a minimum of three major banks under direct regulation. In the case of Ireland, that means the main banks will be directly regulated.

Also, a fail-safe mechanism provides that if the authorities in Frankfurt are worried at any point about a particular bank, they can override the domestic regulator and come in and take direct control of the regulation.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	Here, the pillar banks will be in category 1. Therefore, all direct contact between those banks and their regulator will be with the ECB directly. Is that the thrust of it?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	112	The three main banks in all countries will be directly supervised, but the ECB will obviously build a relationship with local banks also. How it will recruit and where it will establish the regulatory personnel are not clear. We do not know whether people will fly in from Frankfurt or whether a cohort of people will be housed in our Central Bank. I am not sure how the logistics will work, but I am providing the legal theory of what will happen.

Clearly, it will still have a role in regard to non-category 1 regulated entities. What are the implications in terms of the resources that will be needed? Staff currently involved in regulating the pillar banks will no longer be doing that for the Central Bank. Is there a strategy involved?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	The authorities in Frankfurt can supervise through the local central banks, but the authorities will have the legal mandate and will direct how it should be done. They have the freedom to use local personnel when doing local regulatory work. However, the local personnel will not be the regulator.

What changes are proposed in that regard? Does this mean, for example, that the â‚¬100,000 figure guaranteed here will be the standard across Europe? Will it be a standard figure and will the agreement have an impact on the deposit protection account the Central Bank currently holds? What are the key changes proposed for a common deposit insurance scheme?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	118	From the depositor point of view, we hope there will be no changes, because the â‚¬100,000 would be sacrosanct. It is sacrosanct here already, so this would mean no change. What would be organised in Europe is how this will be underpinned financially. We are talking about the size of the European fund underpinning the guarantee and the level of contribution from the financial institutions. The idea is that it would be financed by the industry. However, the mechanics of that have not yet been worked out. The next paper to come forward will deal with the mechanics of the fund underpinning the guarantee and how it will work and whether there will be some element of insurance in it or whether it will be a large fund contributed to by the industry. If there is a loss in a particular institution, it will have to be made good in full out of the fund for depositors with up to â‚¬100,000.

If the banking system collapsed tomorrow morning, that would not go anywhere near meeting the requirements of the insured deposits of up to â‚¬100,000. Will there be an insurance element which will involve third parties?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	The detail has not been worked out yet. We have dealt with the CRD IV, which concerns the capital requirements and the matter of bankers' bonuses, which is attached to that. All of the work regarding supervision is now completed and we have the detail of that. The resolution directive is completed and we have the detail on that. Then, in principle, there is an agreement that there will be a fund underpinning the guarantee on deposits, either to replace or to add to domestic funds. The full logistics of that have yet to be worked out. The bottom line currently is that the â‚¬300 million in the Central Bank is underpinned by a State guarantee. Therefore, the guarantee is not limited to the amount that is in the fund. As I understand, that will be transferred to European level. We will have a banking union regulated centrally and separate from the sovereign bank. Therefore, the underpinning of deposits will be separate from the sovereign banks also.

My final question relates to the budget process here. The Minister referred to the changes brought about by the two-pack agreement in Europe and our budget has been brought forward to 15 October. What is the role of the European authorities in regard to that budget? For example, is the Minister required to submit a draft of the budget to the European Commission in advance of our budget? What are the two-pack requirements which must be met in the lead-up to the delivery of the budget in the House in October?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	122	The draft is required in mid-October. I will explain the terminology in a moment. If we stuck to our traditional date, we would have to bring much of the detail of the budget out in draft form in October and then enact it. Therefore, it is much easier from our point of view to bring the budget forward to October. What Europe means by a draft is what we would normally do in December. It does not regard the full budgetary process as complete until the Finance Bill is enacted at the end of March. Therefore, its idea of a draft is not I would call a draft. The draft is the budget as presented on budget day. Then enactment completes the process. We will bring what Europe calls the draft forward from approximately 7 December to 15 October. We will then have some consultation with Europe and we will supply it with the budget. We will try to introduce the Finance Bill in the same calendar year. For those who are planning an autumn break on the snow slopes, they should expect the Finance Bill sometime between the budget and Christmas.

That takes me back to the time the Minister said I was like the Donegal team, all defenders. Look what we did a year later, so just watch out. Some of the questions I want to raise have been touched on already. In regard to the supervision of the major and systemically important banks, the Minister mentioned there is a minimum requirement of three in each member state. For clarity, which three banks here will be supervised and regulated by the ECB, and will it be only three? Three is a minimum requirement, but I presume it can go beyond that.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	The criteria have yet to be established, but it seems evident that AIB and Bank of Ireland will be the two. There could be a number of bids on the table in regard to the third. In regard to Ulster Bank, for example, the Bank of England is its regulator.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	128	We regulate Ulster Bank in regard to its operations here.

The Minister mentioned the bail-in and Deputy Donnelly also touched on that. Will the Minister tell us what effect the bail-in will have on pillar banks in which we have a shareholding - for example, AIB, which we nearly own completely, or Bank of Ireland? How will the bail-in affect our shareholdings, which are currently valued at approximately â‚¬8 billion or â‚¬9 billion?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	Our resolution has effectively been completed, and our banks are well capitalised. We do not envisage a bail-in coming on top of a bailout. We had a bailout and that is why we have the shares in the banks. This is for future cases when the policy has moved from bailouts, to which we all objected for a long time, to a bail-in system. Many people talked about burning bondholders during the election, and that is effectively what is happening now. The policy positions that the Deputy's party and my party and the Labour Party were advocating in opposition are the policies that are now in the resolution.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	136	I noted the Minister's speech today about the lessons that have been learned, and I welcome the fact that the burning of bondholders is now accepted as the norm in the future. We are not suggesting at this point that the banks may need more capital, because we do not have the evidence, but there are stress tests and the troika are even insisting that we test this before they bid us farewell. I take the Minister's point that his view is that the banks are well capitalised, but if it transpired that one of the banks needed additional capital under the bail-in rules, would it be our shareholdings that would take the first hit?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	If one of our banks needed additional capital, the first option would be to raise it on the markets. That would be the obvious option to take. After that, an application to the ESM would be the next option. It is hypothetical.

There is a bail-in procedure here. My understanding is that we could not go to the ESM without applying the bail-in procedure. Is it not the case that in a bail-in procedure, the first to take the hit are the shareholders, followed by junior bondholders?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	140	The Deputy is mixing up two questions. He is talking about a bail-in for one of the Irish banks and then talking about one of the Irish banks requiring extra capital. I am answering the second part of his question. If an Irish bank requires extra capital, the first recourse would be to the markets and the second recourse would be to the ESM. One would not regard it as an insolvent bank, but a bank that needed additional capital in the estimate of the ECB. Having rescued the banks and with constant monitoring from the Central Bank of Ireland, the Regulator and the ECB, I do not envisage a bail-in situation arising. An extra capital situation might arise.

While there may be a hypothetical requirement for recapitalisation of Irish banks, especially when we move towards the end of the decade and the Basel III rules come in, I do not envisage any situation in which a resolution issue would arise again with the Irish banks.

Under this instrument, the first people to take a hit before we could even get access to the ESM would be the shareholders. Is that not correct? Am I reading this wrong?

That is the sequence for resolution. As the bank gets resolved, its capital would have to be built up as well. One could have a bank needing capital - quite clearly, many of them will need capital, and this will be apparent next year - without any threat of resolution. They will just need additional capital. It has happened before. A bank would be given 18 months or two years to come up with a plan to put capital in place. Some would go to the market, which would be the obvious way to do it. The shareholder would come in; the bank would do an issuance and would try to collect extra capital from its shareholders, who would buy extra shares.

There is no evidence whatsoever that any of the Irish banks will need additional capital next year. What is certain is that there will be stress testing next year, but the Irish banks are very well capitalised. I have no evidence at present that they require any additional capital.

If the banks needed additional capital, would they able to go to the ESM for that capital, and is it the case that the bail-in procedures would not apply?

It may not happen and it hopefully will not happen, but if it did happen, could we get access to the ESM? We were sold this so strongly. There was no reluctance on the part of the Minister during the Lisbon treaty referendum to tell us that we had that lifeline in the ESM. If a bank needs further capital - I am not mixing this up - sometime next year, do we have access to the ESM before we apply for a bail-in, or do we have to apply the bail-in procedure first?

The Minister presided over five ECOFIN meetings during the Presidency. There is one important line at the end of the five-page statement on potential retroactive application of the instrument. It has to be by mutual agreement and it must be on a case-by-case basis. We know that this procedure will not come into effect for a few years. Does retroactive application date from the time we bailed out our banks in the past, or is it from the agreement today? In other words, if this procedure is not available, the ESM is not up and running. If a bank runs into trouble, then a retroactive application can apply because the principle has not been agreed. When does the date of retroactivity begin? Does it definitely apply to us? Is there an understanding behind this text that retroactive applications include the dates on which this State recapitalised our banks? The Minister will understand my frustration one year on that we are still in a situation where not one penny of the money we have injected into the banks has been returned. Indeed, we have crystalised some of it with the sovereign bond with Anglo Irish Bank in terms of the capital, although I acknowledge the short-term benefits in terms of the interest. What is going on behind the scenes? Can the Minister shed any light in respect of the potential of this line? Is there more understanding at ECOFIN, the Eurogroup and ECB level of what this means for Ireland? Is it still on the cards to try to get perhaps not the existing value of the shareholdings in the bank, but the historic value of the shareholdings, or are we basically moving on to try to sell these shares on the international markets? We know that the chief executive of Allied Irish Banks has been setting up several meetings with potential bidders in the United States.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	165	The seismic shift that Deputy Doherty referred to with a sarcastic tone has actually occurred, because the seismic shift was to break the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereigns. That was the seismic shift, as was the substituting of bailouts with bail-ins. We are bringing the resolution arrangements forward now, in consultation with the European Parliament. Eventually, they will be turned into a directive and have the force of law throughout the community. That is the seismic shift. The banking union will be like the banking union in the United States whereby the taxpayer will not be involved in bailouts. Instead, the assets of the banks will be used for bail-ins. Deputy Doherty raised the retroactive question. It is retroactive from the time the ESM is in place and the detailed operational elements that are not settled yet will be settled. There is no commencement date. It is back before that time but there is no base date that prevents us from going back. I am working on the assumption that it applies to the Irish banks and it is on a case-by-case basis. The Irish EU Presidency drove this and the Irish Minister for Finance ensured that this is in the regulations. Everyone knows the intention. How it will work in practice? I am approaching it like I approached the promissory note negotiations. I am opening up a new negotiation and it will be long and slow. We will move carefully to get the best result for Irish taxpayers. Working on a case-by-case basis suits us. The committee will recall the statements made by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Hollande stressing the uniqueness of the Irish case, Ireland being a special case and so on. That is why we work on a case-by-case basis. If I was to promulgate a negotiation that applied equally to Greece, Portugal and Spain as well as Ireland, we would not get beyond first base. The only way was to position this as a unique solution for Ireland because we were not allowed to bail-in the bondholders. The European Central Bank prevented us from doing that. According to the bank, it would have had a contagion effect in Europe. If we participated in preventing the contagion from spreading to the European banking system, then we have a case on which to build. Anyway, all these things are slow and must be carefully built. We will see how we go, but we are in the game all the time.

I am fascinated with the Minister's concept that we will pay ourselves and, therefore, I will be brief. My question relates to the tier 1 status and the top three countries which have access to the ESM. Will that be pan-European? Will Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and Rabobank, all of which have depositors in Ireland, be covered under the national country rules? Will the depositors of the Ulster Bank parent company in the United Kingdom have the same rules applied as the Ulster Bank depositors here?

At present, Ulster Bank is a subsidiary of a bank that is regulated by the Bank of England. However, when we have a banking union the guarantees will be there and there will be a fund to guarantee them. We are unsure yet about how that will relate to the individual sovereign funds.

Will people take the view that deposits will be safer in the bigger protected banks?

The only difference that can arise is on the cost bases of the banks, because the interest rates are fixed at European level. It is up to the banks in the individual countries to fix their cost bases. We hope for a common banking system whereby the price of money throughout the Union would be the same, or within acceptable margins, rather than the position now whereby one can get ten-year German money for 1.50% or 1.60% while ten-year Portuguese money was 8% last night.

One is broad and the other is specific. Across the early phases of the banking union that the Minister has described, is it not likely that we could face the risk of real fragmentation within the European banking system? Let us consider what has occurred in the sovereign debt markets. For a while, the financial markets lent to countries as if no country could go bust. Ireland and Germany got money at the same rate as Greece. However, we are now going to be in a position whereby explicitly there will be a risk that banks can go bust and we will have a way of dealing with it. Financial markets will lend to banks pricing in that risk and one bank will lend to another bank pricing in that risk. Will we not face real pressure on the banking system during that period? My second question is specific. A constituent who heard about the proposal on the radio put it to me that his family has all its money in a single joint bank account. It amounts to a little over â‚¬100,000. If a bank was to go under, then, in the context of a joint or family bank account, what is the bail-in risk that a joint account would face, as opposed to the account of an individual?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-07-03 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	I will address the fragmentation risk first. The European banking system is rather fragmented at present. I have just remarked on the different price of money in the different jurisdictions as represented by ten-year bond prices, for example, and that shows the level of fragmentation. We are trying to create a banking union with one set of supervision rules, resolution rules and deposit guarantee rules such that we remove the fragmentation. The process will be towards a unitary banking system rather like the United States. There will still be some variation depending on the cost bases of the banks. Of course people will price in risk when they are dealing with banks and the banks will price in risk when they are dealing with customers, but that is normal banking. I am suggesting that as it develops, as the European authorities insist that banks are absolutely adequately capitalised and as they carry out stress tests to measure the level of capitalisation - they will carry out stress tests again next year universally throughout Europe - the fragmentation will be taken out and, therefore, one of the primary purposes of the banking union will be achieved. In respect of the level of guarantees, the domestic situation is that deposits up to â‚¬100,000 are guaranteed in the one bank. If the Deputy has any doubts and is advising a constituent, he should tell them that if their money is not with Bank of Ireland, they are entitled to be guaranteed for another â‚¬100,000 in AIB. This does not happen branch by branch. There is no point in swapping into a second Bank of Ireland branch. One needs to go to the other institution. That might be a practical solution for that.
