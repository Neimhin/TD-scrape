#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.A total of 817 files or file parts were transferred to the National Archives to be released for public inspection on 1 January 2008 — and 12 files were withheld.Of the 12 files withheld, one was withheld under section 8(4)(a) of the Act, seven were withheld under section (8)(4)(b) and (c), two were withheld under section 8(4)(c) and two were withheld under section 8(4)(a),(b) and (c).
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I want to ask the Taoiseach a number of questions about the National Archives of Ireland.  Some Departments are slow enough to send their material to the National Archives, principal among which was the Department of Education and Science, although I believe it has improved somewhat.  It is a national embarrassment that the staff of the National Archives of Ireland, despite their first-class work, must struggle every year to put material into facilities that are completely inadequate in this day and age.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach has received a report on this.This matter is not just applicable to the Taoiseach's Government in that it has been applicable to other Governments for very many years.  The under-funding of the National Archives of Ireland, which succeeded the Public Record Office, is severe.  The storage area of the Public Record Office was blown up deliberately by those who were known as the Irregulars in 1922 but the remaining documents have still not been catalogued or examined.  They contain the history of our country.  I understand one of the documents blown up was 1,000 years old but the staff of the National Archives of Ireland still do not have the capacity or facility to put the remaining fragments together for future generations.There is scope for building on the site at Bishop Street but, as the Taoiseach knows, national archive buildings require environmental facilities such as temperature controls.  Buildings that become available under the decentralisation programme might be considered although a number of them are very old and historic and could therefore not be easily adapted.  The Government and all of us as a people should certainly support the rehousing of the archives.Will the Taoiseach indicate what reports he has received on how conditions might be improved?  The staff of the National Archives of Ireland are doing magnificent work.  The storage space is incredibly tight and this is just not plausible if the archives are to be maintained for future generations.  That the remainder of the records destroyed in 1922 still have not been examined and catalogued speaks for itself.  I implicate not only the current Government but all Governments.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I agree that the staff of the National Archives of Ireland do excellent work in the facilities available and in the given circumstances.  Over the past 20 years, the volume of files being sent to the archives by Departments and agencies has increased substantially, and this obviously results in pressure.I would have to get the up-to-date position but I know the Office of Public Works was considering obtaining a very large city-centre location for the archives.  However, I believe there were difficulties in this regard because, as the Deputy pointed out, problems arose with access to the building and environmental considerations.  The building was an old Georgian building on Parnell Square, the old Coláiste Mhuire site.  Afterwards, the Office of Public Works considered some buildlings resulting from decentralisation.  I will ask the office for an update on what it is doing in this regard.It is obviously vital that the existing records be maintained for posterity.  The staff of the National Archives of Ireland have done a lot of work in cataloguing.  I do not have a record of exactly where that work has been done.  The files are enormously important to the State.  I do not refer to the current ones but to the historic ones.  I understand the staff of the National Archives of Ireland have put a lot of effort into cataloguing over the past 20 years.  Perhaps it is not a question of the volume that the staff had to deal with, but I will check.The real problem concerns the significant increase in the space required to store the archives.  I am told a fairly central location is required.  Perhaps I will obtain a report from the Office of Public Works and send it to Deputy Kenny.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In finding a more suitable or appropriate location or a solution to the problem, the Taoiseach will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.  I feel strongly that the National Archives are the history of our country and of our people and his Government and any succeeding Government should make arrangements to ensure these are properly exhibited and preserved, and that the facilities are made available to the staff to catalogue and detail them so that they are there for the next thousand years.On the papers that were released, one that I noticed related to the fact that one of the Taoiseach's predecessors, Liam Cosgrave, ended the boycott on royal occasions which had been in place since the foundation of the State.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to have the Government extend an invitation to Queen Elizabeth of England to visit this State at some time in the future?  There seems to be much speculation about this issue and perhaps he might comment on it.I noted that the late Jack Lynch honoured his commitment to abolish domestic rates.  One of the matters that seems to have been a cause of lingering difficulty for people is that in law one cannot allow for a reduction of rates.  If, let us say citizen Dermot Ahern, who is seated beside the Taoiseach, does up his shop on the local street and improves the street scape, the local authority cannot give him a reduction for the effort made to improve the facade and the facility of his street scape.  Is there any intention that, on reviewing the abolition of the rates, such a reduction might apply?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On the first question, a visit from the Queen of England to this country has been a matter of some debate for some time.  Obviously, until the institutions were back up and running in Northern Ireland it was not a matter that had moved on any further than an aspiration that it would happen.  It was hoped that, with the devolution of policing, the remaining issues outstanding from both the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement would be complete and it was the Government's view that at that stage we could discuss the matter more seriously.I know from over the past decade that she would dearly love to come to this country during her reign and that there has been some discussion around that, but she also understands the practicalities and difficulties of it.  If the issue of policing is completed — it is scheduled to be completed and I hope that is the case in the very short term — then we could put our mind to that matter in a serious way.  We are due to come back on it at that time and we would have an obligation to do so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	She has been around a little longer than the Taoiseach and I know that other members of the British royal family come here on a regular basis.  Would that invitation, if it was to be extended, be as a result of a Cabinet decision or on the basis of an invitation from the President?  Does the Cabinet make the decision to extend an invitation or does it come from Áras an Uachtaráin?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It relates to Head of State and it would be probably from Áras an Uachtaráin with the agreement of the Government.  As I stated, it has been on the agenda for some years, albeit on a low level.  It is something to which we should turn our mind, although it is unclear whether it can happen in the very short term.  As Deputy Kenny will appreciate, a visit like that in its normal planning would take some considerable time.  It will not be in 2008; it would take some considerable time to arrange.  However, it is no secret that it is something the Queen would certainly like to do.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Was that an issue the Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister Brown when he met with him recently or have there been any discussions at governmental level about the possibility of such a visit and how the arrangements might be made for it?On the National Archives, the Taoiseach told us that 12 files have been withheld this year for various reasons.  I appreciate he obviously cannot identify the files, but can he give a general idea as to the subject matter of the files concerned?  What is the aggregate number of files now withheld from the National Archives going back over the years?  Have any files related to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings been withheld?  Have any files relating to the murder of Garda Richard Fallon in 1970 been withheld?  The Taoiseach will recall that at the time this was the first murder of a Garda in the State for almost 30 years.  Members of the late Garda Fallon's family have been on the public record recently expressing concern that there does not appear to be any file relating to his murder extant in the various Departments and the National Archives.  Has any material relating to the murder of Garda Fallon been withheld?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	On the question of whether there has been any Government discussion on a visit by the Queen, the answer is "No".  It has not got to that stage.  There has been no movement and it is unlikely to happen until the devolution of policing is completed.  There has been no discussion on the matter over the years.  Discussion has mainly been at local, official or embassy level and has not moved from that position.Of the total of 818 files or part files transferred to the National Archives this year, 65 files were to do with Northern Ireland.  Most of the files — I think all of them, subject to correction — from all the other sections of my Department would be given over in full.  The only ones held back any year were to do with Northern Ireland.  This year 65 files relating to Northern Ireland were released.  Last year it was 55.  No files were withheld, but of the 65 files, 48 were released without any abstractions.  The comparable figure for last year was 44.  Some 32 documents were extracted from files and partial abstractions from files were made on five documents.  These abstractions were made under section 8(4) (b) and (c), namely, contrary to public interest, might constitute a breach of statutory duty or breach of faith on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence, or might cause distress or a danger to living persons, on the grounds they contain information about individuals or might be likely to lead to an action for damages or defamation.I do not believe my Department would have had any files on Garda Fallon.  That issue would relate to Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Any of the files we have are Northern Ireland based from the times and the earlier period of the Troubles and would relate mainly to contacts between officials on the ground, security briefings that would have been given by the police from Northern Ireland, and information coming to the Government during the period from various groups in Northern Ireland.  Most of the abstractions identify people by name or would be sensitive information clearly stating who was providing information to the Government at the time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	With regard to files being withheld because they identify the names of people, resulting in distress for the people concerned, I understand from the Taoiseach that much of the withheld information has to do with the withholding of names of people who were supplying information.  Over the past decade, has the number of files or documents withheld for that reason been on the increase compared to five or ten years ago?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	We have a 30-year rule.  Obviously, the period since 1969 would have seen a flow of information that was not there previously or since.  We are already coming out of that period from 1969-1971.  More files were released this year.  Of the 65 files, 48 were released without any abstractions so we are coming to a period where there are not many abstractions and no files are being held back in total.  We will see that continue.  The period from 1969 to 1971, which was the most sensitive period because of the difficulties at that time, had the highest number.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I have a final supplementary question in respect of 8(4)(c), which relates to the withholding of documents where they would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the grounds that they contain information about individuals or would or be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation.  If files are withheld for political reasons under that clause, what are the criteria used and is there is any political involvement by the Taoiseach or any member of the Government in the decision as to whether files of that nature are withheld?  
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	We have no involvement.  Officials make that determination based on the legislation.  From what I have been told in respect of these matters, information at the time would have been given by community and church leaders and other individuals who would name people with no level of proof or examination of proof.  It is the same as what happened in respect of the various reports we received from former Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron that intelligence from the ground might say a, b or c but that there is no level of proof in that.  Information like that could not be put into the public domain.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Can the Taoiseach outline the process employed in making decisions to withhold files?  The Act states that a Department may withhold a file if its transfer to the National Archives would be contrary to the public interest.  Can the Taoiseach explain if there is a single officer entrusted with this assessment responsibility within each Department or whether there is wider consultation and if so, with whom?  Does his Department have a specific overriding role?  Is the Garda consulted?  If criteria are laid down, have they ever been published?  Would the Taoiseach object to publishing them so that we could all have a better understanding of how the process works?In respect of the 12 withheld files mentioned in his initial response and their relationship to 1977 or previous years, has the Taoiseach, during his period in office, been aware of any of these files having a direct or indirect reflection on matters that would come under the broad umbrella of collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries, particularly their activities in this State 30 years ago and before then?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The evaluation of files for release is done under the 1986 Act but is carried out by designated officials in my Department.  Neither my Ministers nor I have any role in that process.  It is done under the legislation.  As files are processed for release each year it is normal practice that some are certified by the appropriate official for attention on the grounds set out in the Act but this is a call for the official to make under the Act.  I referred earlier to the sections of the Act.  On the Deputy's question about provision being made to review closed files, that happens at five-yearly intervals from the date the certificate to withhold records is made and my Department complies with this statutory obligation.  Files held back are subjected to a five-year review where circumstances might change and those files can then be released.I do not have detailed figures but the numbers for the past five years amount to 55 files.  There are four certifying officers in my Department, all at least of principal officer grade, as required under the Act.  Other Departments have similar arrangements.  The names of the certifying officers are published in the annual report of the director of the National Archives.There is no secret about the process used.  All files of more than 30 years old must be released unless they have been certified for attention by the certifying officer.  They must be released unless there is a certificate issued by one of the four officers.  The certifying officers in other Departments obtain the consent of an authorised officer of my Department so the Act provides for a connection with my Department.

Is it because of the specific potential sensitivities of records associated with the Taoiseach's Department that it has a greater number of officers with that designation?Have the criteria been published?  What are the guidelines given to these deciding officers who issue this certification?  Will the Taoiseach agree that publication of these guidelines would help public understanding of the process?The Taoiseach quoted a number of sections of the National Archives Act 1986.  Section 8(11) indicates that the Taoiseach may by order prescribe a particular class or classes of records to which a certificate granted under subsection 204 may relate and may by order, amend or revoke an order under this subsection.  Has the Taoiseach ever exercised this power under section 8(11) of the Act to prescribe a particular class or classes of records that may or may not be transferred?  If so, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what classes of records he has so prescribed over his period in office?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I do not think I have ever invoked section 8(11) of the Act.  I will check whether I have and I will inform the Deputy.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	On a point of clarification, my Department has four certifying officers at principal officer grade.  Other Departments have similar arrangements.  I do not know how many are in each Department but each Department has certifying officers.  The names of certifying officers are published in the annual report of the director of the National Archives.  They implement the Act and their powers are set out clearly in the Act.  Any other issues about what is retained are also dealt with in the report of the director of the National Archives.  There are no hidden details.There is not a list given of the files held back because in many cases the name on the file would give the information.  Most of the files held back are not recorded — they are recorded in Departments but not publicly recorded for that reason.  Then there is the five-year look-back rule, where it might become appropriate to release these files.  Overall, with the exception of Northern Ireland, there are very few files that have been held back.  In regard to files relating to Northern Ireland, a total of 55 were released to the National Archives last year.  Two files were withheld under the 75-year rule of the European Court of Human Rights, while 45 were released entirely without redaction.  Most of the files are now being released.  Redactions mainly concern names.  I do not know what the two files are withheld under the 75-year rule.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	25	From recent Cabinet activities, it seems all Ministers are completely compliant with whatever the Taoiseach says.  The release of the archives prompts me to ask whether the present Cabinet ever has any rows.  There was a real spat between Pat Cooney and Richie Ryan about matters that the then Minister, Mr. Cooney, wanted to raise and the then Minister for Finance said he would not waste the time of his officials and would take up the matters at Cabinet directly.  I note that the archives indicate that the late Michael O'Leary went on a solo run about a public holiday, that the hunger strikers caused a division with the Vatican and that President Hillery threatened to move out of the Áras if the Government did not deal with his transport problem.  I suppose we have moved on from all these issues.  When we read the releases, it reminds us of an energetic time in Irish politics.  Are there any hidden gems we can look forward to being released in 30 years time from the current stock of compliant brilliant men and women who sit around the table with the Taoiseach?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	28	In 30 years as always there will be some interesting reading material.  In fairness to the people who were involved 30 years ago, they had some very difficult issues to deal with.  When we look back at some of the records of 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, they were difficult and dangerous times.  Looking back, there was the loyalist strike and some cross-Border issues when the SAS men were arrested in the South.  I think a few politicians from the North were arrested in the South.  Therefore, they were difficult times.  Of course, we have friendly spats.  I am not sure the Deputy will have to wait 30 years to read about them.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Interesting.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.The legislative priorities of the Government are set out in the legislative programme published on 29 January.  My Department has one item of legislation on the C list, the Statute Law Revision Bill, the purpose of which is to review local and personal and private Acts enacted prior to 6 December 1922.  While it is not possible to give a final estimate, it is hoped the heads of the Bill will be submitted to the Government in 2009.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I accept this may be slightly outside the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach but eight of the Bills were on the list for 2007, while nine are new.  We have not enacted any legislation in this period.  Why were nine of the 17 so-called priority Bills on the list of legislation for the autumn 2007 session not published and now reappear in the spring legislative programme?  Is there a reason for this or is it that the Whip is being told by various Departments, and the authority that frames this legislation in the first place, that these things will come through although they do not?  Of the original list of 17 Bills, nine of them were not published but they now appear on another list.  What is the procedure involved and why was the Whip unable to provide accurate information when he published the list last September?  In order to set a record in this session and pass some legislation, we may have to sit longer than was intended.  The record in terms of productivity does not measure up that well as we enter into pay talks about productivity in many other areas.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Since the Government took office on 14 June 2007, 12 Bills have been enacted.  To date this year, six Bills have been published.  Legislation is regularly listed as a priority in Departments but it can take longer from the time the heads of a Bill are agreed, to drafting and dealing with legal issues that inevitably arise.  Some of the Bills go back to Departments a number of times when trying to finalise agreement.  The senior parliamentary counsel can be occupied full-time on some of the major Bills.  For example, every year the Finance Bill takes several months of work following the budget.  It is four months from budget day to the date of completion of the Bill.  The work of the parliamentary draftsman, together with amendments on Committee Stage, and Report and Final Stages take up so much time.  The Immigration Residence and Protection Bill, for example, can tie someone up full-time for several months and therefore other Bills can lose out in the pecking order, although they are important to the relevant Departments.  Another example is the broadcasting Bill, which will be coming through shortly.  The preparatory work on that legislation has been long and detailed.  As I said here two weeks ago, there is a range of legal issues surrounding the fair deal legislation, which has taken time.  A small number of Bills therefore can take an enormous amount of the parliamentary draftsman's time, with the result that other Bills are delayed.  Most of the Bills on the list, however, will come through over the next month or so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, wanted to push the fair deal legislation through in the two days before the Christmas recess.  We always had an understanding that rushed law can be bad law.  Given that the Taoiseach commented on the fair deal legislation, is it likely to come before the House in this session or shortly after Easter?  Do the legal problems concern property ownership or what is the big obstacle?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	34	As the Deputy recalls, we agreed at Christmas to consult the interested groups and the advice of the Attorney General was also sought.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is still dealing with that issue and hopes to bring forward the proposals after Easter.  I have not been dealing with it directly but I know from conversations that it is possible to draft the Bill.  There is no difficulty about the legality but there are enormously complex issues around it, which is what has taken the time.  Having said that, a large amount of people are clamouring to get on with this but it will take a little bit more time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I agree with Deputy Kenny that a very small amount of legislation is emerging from this Government in its post-general election manifestation. Among the Bills we know will be published is the referendum Bill to deal with the EU treaty.  When are we likely to see this Bill?  Has the Government set a date for the referendum?  Can we now take it there will not be a Bill in 2008 dealing with a referendum on children's rights?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	36	My questions are very much in the same vein as those of Deputy Gilmore.  The first two questions he asked are straightforward.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the referendum Bill on the Lisbon treaty will be published before Easter?  Does he intend naming the date for the referendum this week?  He must give a clear indication so that the debate can take place.In regard to Deputy Gilmore's third question on the proposed constitutional amendment on children's rights, will the Taoiseach advise the House whether a final determination has been made to reject the idea of what was described as decoupling one particular area out of the broad raft of issues concerning children's rights?  Is the Government determined to go ahead with a single constitutional referendum on children's rights?  When does the Taoiseach envisage the Bill will be published?  I am aware the deliberations on it are ongoing and that an extension of time has been sought by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, but will the Taoiseach give us some indication?  Is he looking at the end of this year or will it be 2009 or, as indicated in previous responses here, given that it cannot now take place in tandem with the Lisbon treaty referendum, does he foresee it being held back even further?

That will allow us to proceed in setting up the referendum commission and giving it the 90 days it asked for.  The election will take place at the very end of May or into mid-June.  We did not fix a date.

The decision has been made that we will deal with it in one aspect, without decoupling the issues.  In my view, it will be into 2009 before the referendum takes place.  Even if the committee finishes its work in the autumn, to allow for discussions between the parties so that we can come to an agreement and have a successful referendum, it will be into 2009.  I have spoken to some of the leaders of the various children's interests groups and they want it to be dealt with as one issue.  They are willing to wait until 2009 but we certainly hope it does not go anything beyond that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Many years ago, when the committee system was being discussed, the whole purpose of the exercise was to refer the heads of Bill to committees.  That seems to have fallen by the wayside.  It is an ideal means of having the general principle of legislation discussed and debated and teasing out possible difficulties at committee level and, thus, on an all-party basis.  In many cases, there is little political difference between parties on certain types of legislation.  Will the Taoiseach, who is a former Whip, consider the possibility of restoring the original idea of referring the heads of Bills to committees, in line with his overall desire to reform this Parliament?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I agree with Deputy Barrett on this issue.  We have been pressing this matter.  There was a consultation process on the Internet before the House considered the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006.  It was a good exercise.  I have asked other Departments to do the same thing.  Some Departments are very good.  My own view is that it is a very good way of teasing out and debating the submissions at an early stage.  Legislation which may seem uninteresting to us all in here will be of interest to groups outside the House and the political system.  They can build up a head of steam.  The best way to allow them to have an input is to publish the heads of the Bills.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	51	If committee debates on the heads of Bills are televised, special interest groups can see what is being discussed and make submissions in return.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I agree.  We have done that with a number of Bills over the past few years.  Some Departments seem a little reluctant to engage in this process.  I have been pressing for more Departments to do it.  It was of great assistance in the case of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006.   There was a broad process of consultation not just within the Oireachtas, but also within the interested groups.  It will improve the legislation that comes before the House.  There will probably be far fewer issues than there would be if Bills were not considered in this way.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Taoiseach should take up this suggestion.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I do not doubt that when the next Dáil session commences, some of the Bills which are currently on section A of the legislative list will still be on section A of the list.  Deputies asked in the House about the status of the Charities Bill 2007 on numerous occasions before it was finally considered and passed.  We were told that the delay in that instance was caused by problems in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  How many draftspeople in that office are putting Bills together at present?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I have previously given a detailed account of the number of parliamentary draftspeople.  There are issues relating to the main Bills of the year, such as the finance and social welfare Bills, and other key Bills like referendum and immigration Bills.  Such legislation ties up parliamentary draftspeople for a considerable number of months each year.  When such Bills are given priority, other Bills are put on the back burner.  While each year's social welfare Bill may not be complex, other Bills can take up a substantial amount of time.  Each year's finance Bill can tie up senior draftspeople for the best part of four months, which is a significant portion of the year.  The drafting of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 also took a long time.Delays are not always caused by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel — legislation can be held up by discussions within and between Departments on various issues.  All of that has to be agreed before the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel can start to draft a Bill.  When compared to other Parliaments, the Oireachtas passes a large number of Bills each year.  The point was made earlier that we need to be more concerned about the quality of legislation rather than the number of Bills which are drawn up.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The House will join me in offering heartfelt sympathies to the families of two Polish citizens who tragically died as a result of injuries they sustained in a serious attack with an offensive weapon in Drimnagh on 23 February last.  A full-scale Garda investigation is under way.  The Garda Síochána will, of course, spare no resources to bring about a successful outcome to the investigation.  The House will understand that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the details of the investigation.The number of deaths involving knives and similar weapons is a particular cause for concern.  The number of murders involving stabbing doubled last year from 18 to 36.  We have very strong penalties for offences involving knives.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Offensive Weapons Order 1991, which control knives and offensive weapons, set out prohibitions on such weapons and severe penalties for breaking those prohibitions.  The legislative provisions dealing with offensive weapons and any other measures which might be taken to counteract their availability and use are kept under constant review by my Department.  At my request, the Garda Síochána is conducting a review of the provisions of the legislation in the context of the increased use of offensive weapons in assaults and murders.  The purpose of the review is to identify aspects of the legislation that may require strengthening from an enforcement perspective.  I understand the Commissioner intends to make a submission to me shortly.All too often the use of offensive weapons is the end result of a pattern of anti-social behaviour or the excessive consumption of alcohol.  One of the policing priorities I have set for the Garda Síochána for 2008 under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 is to combat, particularly in co-operation with other agencies and the community generally, public disorder, with particular emphasis on alcohol-related misbehaviour.Issues of particular concern are the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences and how alcohol products are sold in such outlets, including below cost selling and special promotions.  I share the view that we have a problem with our patterns of drinking.  It is clear this problem is adding to public disorder.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Following the establishment of the Government alcohol advisory group at the beginning of the year, I have asked the group to examine urgently key aspects of the law governing the sale and consumption of alcohol, including those directed towards combating excessive and under-age alcohol consumption.  I have asked the group to report to me by the end of this month.  I intend to bring forward after Easter urgent proposals for changes in the law which, with the support of both Houses, I hope will be enacted and implemented before the summer recess.  In parallel with this, work will continue on the drafting of a comprehensive Sale of Alcohol Bill, which is included in the Government legislative programme for 2008 and which will modernise and streamline the law in this area.We have to continue to try to get the message across, to young people in particular, that carrying around knives is dangerous and wrong.  One very effective way of addressing this is to introduce a long-term education and awareness raising programme aimed particularly at young people.  As part of the policing plan for this year the Garda has decided to launch a publicity campaign aimed at discouraging people from carrying knives.  This will be in addition to taking rigorous action under the criminal law against those found carrying them, and it follows from the policing priorities I determined for this year, which include targeting the use of knives for violent attacks.The Government attaches the highest importance to tackling the use of illegal firearms and offensive weapons generally.  The first of the priorities which I have determined for the Garda Síochána for 2008 is targeting gun crime and the illegal activities most closely associated with such crime.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I join the Minister in his words of sympathy to the families of those brutally murdered in the most recent tragedy on our streets.  I put it to him that killings and stabbings with offensive weapons of varying degrees, as well as gangland killings with firearms, are evidence that criminals have absolutely no difficulty in acquiring such weapons for the use of lethal force.  Will he undertake in the review an examination of the availability of lethal weapons over the counter?  Some months ago I brought to the attention of the House the fact that samurai swords and other such implements were available for sale over the counter in retail outlets at a cost of approximately €50 or €60.  What function does the Minister see for such swords other than inflicting serious injury and perhaps death?  After I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister, there was an horrific case in west Finglas in which an individual had his arm sliced off with a samurai sword.  The Minister must not only look at the use of such weapons in the context of firearms and offensive weapons legislation but also at the sale, importation and retail distribution of such implements.  What steps does he propose to take to outlaw and ban such weapons?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Deputy introduced in the course of his question the incidence of routine gangland murders involving the use of firearms.  Whereas there was an increase in the number of homicides involving the use of knives last year, there was a decline in the number of gangland murders.  The reason for this was the incessant activity of the Garda Síochána in connection with Operation Anvil.  A careful examination of the statistics pertaining to the robbery of cash in transit vehicles demonstrates that there was a significant decline in the amount taken last year.  That is the lifeblood of criminal gangs who wish to purchase firearms.  I draw attention to this fact.We have a very serious problem with regard to the use of knives and offensive weapons.  In that context, it is worth noting that the investigation into the recent incident — the basis of the Deputy's question — has not been completed but on the evidence of one of the statements made to the Garda, the implement that may have been used was a screwdriver.  It is not possible to regulate the sale, distribution and possession of screwdrivers.  That is an illustration of the difficulty in strengthening the law.The Deputy mentioned an incident involving the use of a samurai sword, which resulted in my asking the Commissioner to complete a review of the subject to see if the law could be strengthened in connection with the use of such an implement.  I await the findings of that review which I understand from the Commissioner will be completed very soon.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The seriousness of this issue, involving the use on a daily basis of offensive and lethal weapons such as firearms, is not such that it can await further consultative reports and reviews.  The issue is now so serious that immediate action is required.  We hear on a regular basis that members of criminal gangs are in receipt of expert firearms training in Prague in the Czech Republic, where they can undergo such training without having to register or show a passport.  The people in question can catch a aeroplane back and engage in the activity we see on a routine basis in gangland circles.  What action has the Minister taken in conjunction with his European colleagues to deal with this matter?  Does the Minister agree such behaviour is unacceptable?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	With effect from 1 November 2006, there has been a mandatory minimum sentence of between five and ten years under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle and the use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.  There are very strict penalties for such offences.  I will certainly raise the issue indicated by the Deputy with the corresponding Minister, the Minister for the Interior, in the Czech Republic.  It was a tradition in many of the former Warsaw Pact countries to have a substantial number of citizens highly trained in the use of arms.  That core and body of people do not need any fresh training.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	We must never lose sight of the fact that regardless of whether crime figures show a decrease or an increase, they represent victims and those close to them whose lives have been adversely affected by a criminal act.  There was an increase in headline crime in 2007 of 1.7% but this must be seen against the background of the unprecedented rise taking place in our population.  Taking this increase into account, the level of crime has reduced from 27.8 crimes per 1,000 population in 1996 to 26 in 2003 and 24.2 in 2007.  I have been informed the overall Garda detection rate for headline offences for 2007 was 41%, up from 40.4% at the end of 2006.  With regard to 2007, the increase in the number of homicides from 67 to 84 was a particular cause for concern. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that in 2007 the detection rate in the case of murder was 68% and in the case of manslaughter, 100%.  I should note that the detection rate for crimes committed in a particular year, by its nature, increases over time as Garda investigations progress.I commend the Garda for the fact that the number of murders involving the use of firearms which are predominantly gangland related was significantly reduced, from 26 in 2006 to 18 in 2007. The Government has no greater priority than bringing gangland killings to an end and to bring those involved in gangland activities to justice.  In the last while we have seen a number of successful operations carried out by the Garda Síochána to deal with gangland crime and I am sure all Members of the House will join me in commending the force.  Tragically, however, there was a doubling of the number of homicides involving stabbing, from 18 in 2006 to 36 in 2007.The 2008 policing plan reflects the policing priorities which I have determined for this year.  Among them is the targeting of the use of knives for violent attacks.  The plan includes a commitment to a publicity campaign directed at this problem.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Some killings stem from domestic violence.  In response to this and the challenge posed by such violence, we have established the COSC — a new executive office within my Department — to give priority to the issue of domestic violence, with the particular objective of treating all instances of domestic violence as the appalling crimes they are.I welcome the fact that there has been a substantial increase in the number of drug detections: an increase of 58.5% in the rate of detection of the cultivation, manufacture and importation of drugs and an increase of 19.7% in the rate of detection of the possession of drugs for sale or supply. Whereas the numbers of drugs detections add to the overall crime figures, in reality they represent the level of Garda activity and success in tackling the drugs menace and reflect a sustained and comprehensive set of Garda operations throughout the State. Some 0.7% of the 1.7% increase in headline crime in 2007 is accounted for by such drugs detections.I am aware that complex issues surround the willingness of victims to report sexual offences but, nevertheless, I am pleased to note that the figures show a reduction in the overall number of sexual crimes, which is down 10.7%.  The number of burglaries decreased by 5.4% in 2007, which represented 22% of all headline crime. Increases in the level of burglary, theft from shops and theft from MPVs largely account for the rise of 6% in total headline crime which took place during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Commissioner has informed me that strategies are being devised by assistant commissioners with the aim of taking immediate remedial action in these areas. I also welcome the continuing positive trend in the number of robberies of an establishment or institution, down 26.5%, for example, and robbery of cash or goods in transit, down 35% during the year.I am determined to ensure the Garda Síochána is provided with the necessary personnel and equipment.  For this year I secured a Garda budget of over €1.6 billion.  This is an unprecedented investment in policing and represents an 11% increase on the budget for 2007.  With regard to the number of members of the force, the Government commitment to increase Garda strength to 15,000 by 2010 remains on target.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Is it not a fact that the number of murders was up, according to the CSO, by 30% and the number of attempted murders by 61%?  There are statistics, lies and damn lies.The Minister stated properly that he wanted to extend his sympathy to the families and friends of the two young men murdered in the past ten days and I join him in so doing.  He then proceeded to say, also properly, that it would not be appropriate for him to comment further.  Is it not the case that he has elevated to the level of policy a virtue of not commenting, unlike his predecessor, whenever a tragedy such as this happens?  Unfortunately, one happens every weekend.  The Minister, however, does not comment.  What has he to say to law-abiding citizens fearful for their personal safety because of gangs of teenagers congregating with menace and intimidating them with a garda nowhere to be seen or found?  What kind of sickness is in our society when law-abiding citizens are fearful of these gangs of marauding teenagers who gather with menace outside off-licenses, etc?What has the Minister to say to the parents of young people going out at night and who are fearful that they might accidentally become the next victim of such gangs of youths because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Deputy Rabbitte began with homicide and I very fairly accepted there was an increase in the number of homicides last year but I pointed out that there was a reduction in the number of gangland homicides in which firearms were used.  There was an overall increase in the homicide rate last year, as Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, and there are wider social trends in operation here.  A substantial number of killings stem from domestic violence and that is why Cosc was established in my Department as an executive office, namely, to give greater priority to the issue of domestic violence.Deputy Rabbitte then asked the obvious and salient question about commenting on current cases.  I comment on criminal incidents in a general sense.  However, I do not comment in detail on the facts of a case when charges have not even been preferred, as is the case in regard to the incident which happened in recent days in Drimnagh.  I deplore the phenomenon Deputy Rabbitte outlined of marauding youths intimidating neighbours and residents lawfully going about their business.We have allocated a very substantial budget to the Garda Síochána which stands at €1.6 billion this year.  The attested strength of the Garda is 13,732 with a further 1,310 gardaí in student training, which is a record number.  We are determined to ensure they are deployed to maximum effect in dealing with these gangs.  There is a panoply of legislation in operation.  I have established an alcohol advisory group which will report quickly and will result in legislation to introduce further curbs on the availability of alcohol which is a major factor in the public disorder to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Is it not the first duty of Government to ensure citizens feel safe walking the streets and in their homes?  That is not the case at present.  It is all very well for the Minister to say he condemns the public disorder but it is not very reassuring for parents who are concerned when their young son or daughter goes out at night whether they will come home without being the victim of an incident.I am not asking the Minister to comment on a particular incident but I am saying to him that everybody except the Government knows this phenomenon of youths loitering with intent intimidating law-abiding citizens is everywhere in urban Ireland.  There is a malaise in our society.  That a person cannot even resort to a garda when circled by young thugs is the responsibility of the Minister.  Despite the figures he quoted about the number of gardaí, there is no visible evidence of gardaí patrolling trouble spots such as this.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The gardaí are exceptionally visible on the ground and in recent weeks, I arranged for an allocation of further resources to ensure additional bicycles are provided to the Garda Síochána to maximise its visibility and presence on the ground in areas troubled in the manner Deputy Rabbitte described.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Presumably, the Deputy is referring to recent reports regarding the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs in our prisons.  In regard to the figures published, some of them relate to the use of drugs immediately prior to committal.  The length of time prisoners were in custody before being tested was not recorded, so a precise breakdown of such cases cannot be given.It should also be noted that the power to take random mandatory drug tests of prisoners only came into existence in October 2007 when the new prison rules came into operation.  Prior to that date, drug testing had been primarily targeted at prisoners with a known history of drug misuse.  The figures should not be seen as an indicator of drug misuse across the wider prisoner population.Nevertheless, the level of positive tests among prisoners is a cause for serious concern.  The policy and strategy of the Irish Prison Service to keep drugs out of prisons aims to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons with tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits and committals in all closed prisons; greater use of screened visits; increased random searching of cells and their occupants; use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities; use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.I would also like to advise the Deputy that a number of new security initiatives will shortly be introduced in all closed prisons.  These include the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving 30 handling teams; and the establishment of an operational support group dedicated to developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons.  They will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.The physical design and urban setting of some of the State's older prisons, such as Mountjoy, does not assist in combating the inflow of drugs.  The proposed new prison at Thornton Hall in County Dublin addresses this deficiency by the creation of a cordon sanitaire around it.Drug treatment services to prisoners are also being significantly enhanced through the development of new services and programmes.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.These services are being delivered by the Irish Prison Service in partnership with community based services and contracted private services and supported by additional staffing for prison based drug treatment teams — for example, an addiction counselling service which is being provided by Merchants Quay is, in conjunction with other developments, delivering nearly 1,000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling.There are also currently drug free units in Wheatfield Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Castlerea Prison and Mountjoy Prison.  There is a detox programme in operation in Mountjoy.  Allied to this the training unit, Arbour Hill, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are regarded as drug-free institutions.  I am committed to ensuring that the Irish Prison Service continues to take all measures necessary to deal with this issue.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Notwithstanding the Minister's lengthy reply, I put it to him that this is one aspect of Government policy which has been a complete failure.  Promise after promise by the Minister and his predecessor over the years that our prisons would be drug free ring hollow in the context of the recent figures.  I put it to him also that security in our prisons in terms of access to them is in some way deficient having regard to the fact that in recent weeks, members of the public could freely walk into two different prisons.  That is a further example of security in our prisons being less than satisfactory.What is needed is airport-type security with screens, radar detectors and sniffer dogs to ensure we can bring an end to a situation where many prisoners have greater drug problems leaving prison than they have when they enter them.  The Government's national drugs strategy's critical implementation path promised the appointment of an independent evaluator in 2007 but this has not yet taken place.  When will such an appointment be made?  Is the Minister satisfied there is sufficient security in our prisons because the present situation is totally unacceptable?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I assure Deputy Charles Flanagan that the dogs are on the way and the handlers are being trained.  I am not aware of what promises I have made in this area but I very much believe in action.  I will supply the Deputy with the information about the evaluator, but on my appointment I found I did not need an evaluator to tell me about the extent of this problem.  I went to Government and got a decision to take a number of practical measures needed to address it.  Those measures are now being implemented.  I hope they will work given time.  They involve much tighter control and monitoring of all prisoner visits in all closed prisons.  Deputy Charles Flanagan and other Deputies will be aware this led to some industrial relations difficulties before Christmas but I am glad to say they have been resolved.They also involve new visiting arrangements in most closed prisons with visitors required to be preapproved by the governor and required to prove identification on each visit; increased random searching of cells and their occupants; airport-type security to which Deputy Flanagan referred; the introduction of modern cameras and probe systems to search difficult areas; the introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons — visitors and staff — entering the prisons; the establishment of the drug detection dog service to which I referred; and the operational support unit which will operate outside the existing Prison Service staff, subject to a governor in each prison.  It will operate as a separate intelligence unit, gathering information in this area and targeting those responsible for the illicit supply of drugs into prisons.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Does the Minister accept that the screening arrangements relating to visits are insufficient to counter the passing of illegal substances — namely, drugs — between visitors and prisoners?  Will he consider introducing, in respect of certain visits, physical screens between prisoners and visitors?  Having regard to the seriousness of this problem, perhaps consideration could be given to ensuring that prisoners dress in a form of clothing that does not contain pockets, pouches or other areas in which drugs may be secreted.  It is entirely unsatisfactory that prisoners engaged in detoxification are not segregated from those who are freely taking drugs.  This is part of the problem.  There is an entire drugs underworld in our prisons that is not being dealt with in an adequate manner.

On the matter of detoxification, not only in respect of those addicted to drugs but also for those addicted to alcohol, it is important — I have considered this matter in the context of Thornton Hall — to provide separate facilities for those affected in order that they can have a real opportunity to kick the habit while they are incarcerated.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	As the Deputy is probably aware, leave to remain in the State is predominantly sought by non-European economic area nationals who do not have a separate legal basis for being here.  In the great majority of cases, applications of this nature are lodged by persons who have claimed asylum and who have had their applications finally rejected.  They are also made by persons who have otherwise become illegal in the State through, for example, the expiration of a visitor visa or a work permit.Applications for leave to remain in the State are founded on the provisions of section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  Under these provisions, persons who have no legal basis for being in the State are afforded the following options: to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to deportation; or to submit, within a period of 15 working days, written representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons they should be permitted to remain temporarily in the State.  The majority of persons faced with these choices opt for the latter and submit, or have submitted on their behalf, written representations in support of their applications for permission to remain in the State.As the Deputy will appreciate, all such applications must be considered on their individual merits.  As provided for under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a range of factors must be examined.  The consideration of each application also involves an examination of the position of the applicant with regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement.The consideration of each application is a resource-intensive process for staff working in the Irish naturalisation and immigration service, INIS, of my Department, particularly when one considers that many applicants will, separately, have had asylum applications examined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and may also have submitted applications for subsidiary protection.  The Deputy will appreciate that this multi-layered approach to bringing individual cases to finality is not resource efficient.  That is why a single procedure is envisaged in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, which is currently before the House.The sheer volume of such applications, and the reality that resources are not unlimited and must be prioritised, means that there will always be a backlog.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.However, the Deputy can rest assured that strenuous efforts have been and continue to be made to ensure that applications are processed as promptly as possible.  Additional staff have been deployed to the area and considerable investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such applications.The Deputy will appreciate that these efforts will enable the INIS, in the coming year, to make further significant progress in finalising leave to remain applications.  I am satisfied also that the provisions set out in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will greatly streamline the means by which applications of the nature referred to by the Deputy are processed to finality.

Is it not extremely questionable that people are obliged to wait, literally for years, in asylum accommodation centres?  These individuals have nothing to do all day and this is costing millions of euro in taxpayers' money.  In some cases, it takes up to seven years before a decision is made on a leave to remain application.  Is that an appropriate system?What specific steps does the Minister intend to take in order to address the problems that exist?  While the system may be resource intensive, it is also creating additional pressures in the context of the cost of accommodation, etc.  Is it not the case that by putting in place investment to allow those responsible to deal expeditiously with applications, we would save money in the long term?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I completely agree with the Deputy.  That is why the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is before the House.  The only way to deal with this matter is to put in place a single procedure in respect of applications of this nature.  That is why it is of great importance that the legislation should be enacted as soon as possible.It is regrettable that many persons are obliged to live in refugee accommodation for substantial periods.  However, in addition to the three stages I outlined in my initial reply, there is also a constant recourse to the courts by way of proceedings for judicial review to impugn decisions that are taken in this multi-layered administrative process.  If, at the end of the process, a person has exhausted his or her entitlements under the different statutory provisions and I decide, in the exercise of my discretion, that it is appropriate to make a deportation order, that, in turn, is often impugned before the courts.  The new legislation will address many of these issues and will allow us to proceed on the basis of a rapid turnaround in respect of cases of this nature, which is what is required.

What will happen to existing applications when that legislation is enacted?  It will not be possible to consider the various facets because they will already have been dealt with by parts of the system.  The reason many of these cases come before the courts is that, as highlighted by the Supreme Court, we do not have a clear and transparent system in respect of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

I am not aware of any comments made by the Supreme Court in respect of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The debate on the legislation before the House will give us the opportunity to consider the tribunal, which will become the protection tribunal, and how it can be established in a way that ensures consistency, clarity and protection of both the public interest and of the interests of those who are genuine asylum seekers.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, it is open to me to set policing priorities for the Garda Síochána.  One of the priorities I have set for 2008 is to combat, particularly in co-operation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder.  I specified that there should be particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour, including under age drinking, and socially disadvantaged communities.Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  In particular, it provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.I share the view, however, that we have a problem with our patterns of drinking in this country.  It is clear that this problem is adding to public disorder.  I have asked the Government alcohol advisory group, which was established at the beginning of the year, to urgently examine key aspects of the law governing the sale and consumption of alcohol, including those directed towards combating excessive and under age alcohol consumption.  I have asked it to report to me by the end of this month.The Criminal Justice Act 2006 enacted provisions to combat anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  These set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  A significant number of behaviour warnings have been issued under the legislation — 445 behaviour warnings to adults up to the end of January and 131 to children.In addition to the criminal law, there is a range of initiatives in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour.  The Garda juvenile diversion programme has proved highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  Under the provisions of the Children Act 2001, the programme has a statutory basis.Garda youth diversion projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  There are 100 projects operating throughout the country and it is intended to establish a further 68 projects in the lifetime of this Government, bringing the total number of projects to 168 nationwide.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas Members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  Issues of public disorder will be high on the agenda of such committees.  There are 29 committees in operation in a pilot phase to gain experience rolling the committees out to all local authority areas in the State.  In general, the outcome to date has been positive and the committees are meeting definite local needs.Following a consultation seminar last November, work is under way on revising the guidelines under which the committee operates in the light of the experience gained to date.  Following consultation with my ministerial colleagues, I intend to issue revised guidelines to enable the roll-out of the committees to take place as soon as possible, which I envisage will be in the middle of this year.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The most urgent project for the Minister to consider is adequate policing in the area.  The Minister is aware that the recent horrific murders in Drimnagh prompted the community to say that there was a perceived lack of community gardaí in the vicinity.  Had they been in the area the type of problem that faced the people of Drimnagh may not have occurred.What is happening in regard to the rolling out of the 2008 national scheme for community gardaí that the Minister has promised numerous times?  What does the Minister mean by community policing?  Does he mean a garda working and living in the community and that there would be appropriate incentives for the garda to live in the community rather than drive in every morning and home in the afternoon?  Would the Minister consider Fine Gael's proposal that there be a specific grade of garda, the community garda, whose job would be to police the area in conjunction with the community and who would be charged with the task of building the community's confidence and trust in the Garda Síochána?  Why is progress on this matter so slow that only 4% of target areas have been included?What is the problem with anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs?  Is the Garda Síochána reluctant to engage in the kind of policing that can give rise to an anti-social behaviour order?  Why have only one or two been granted since the scheme was initiated over a year ago?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Commissioner visited Drimnagh and was satisfied that there was an adequate number of community gardaí on duty in that area.  They represent 4.6% of the total strength of the force and the total number of personnel attached to community policing is 630.  Those gardaí perform the duties as defined by Deputy Charles Flanagan, but, in a sense, every garda is a community garda, coming into contact with the community in his or her district in many different ways and ensuring the prevention of crime and the protection of neighbourhoods.  That is fundamental.  Community policing involves more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána.  All gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues.I agree with the view of the Garda inspectorate, expressed in a recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.  A review of community policing is under way but community policing is not confined to community policemen.Many anti-social behaviour orders have been issued.  Much of the more serious anti-social activity already falls within the rubric of a defined criminal offence and can be dealt with under the public order legislation, as required.  The graduated approach envisaged in the legislation is the right one and gives the gardaí an opportunity to ratchet up the pressure to conform on the person who is responsible for anti-social behaviour.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The time for Priority Questions has expired.  We must, therefore, take Questions Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, in ordinary time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The latest available figures show that there are 630 members of the Garda Síochána assigned to community policing, compared to a total attested strength of 13,755.  This represents 4.58% of the total strength of the force.  As with any large organisation, these figures can fluctuate from day to day, for example, due to promotions, retirements and transfers.While this is the number of gardaí specifically assigned to community policing, all gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána and I agree with the view of the Garda inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force.  Against this background, he is reviewing arrangements within the Garda Síochána for community policing.  I welcome this and I look forward to its outcome and to hearing what the Commissioner proposes for the future development of community policing.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Is it not the case that when the Minister says every garda is a community garda we are engaged in a dialogue of the deaf?  That is not what community policing means.  It is not what the inspectorate meant when it commented on the desirability of community policing.  It is to do with the visible presence of gardaí patrolling, talking to people they know and living in the community.  That is not happening.  That the Minister can say that 4.5% of the manpower is allocated to community policing suggests that there is no commitment to the philosophy of community policing to which the Minister pays lip service.There is no special tangible arrangement for a grade of community garda and no evidence that residents in communities that suffer from anti-social behaviour and other kinds of low level crime — nonetheless injurious for that — are able to access a garda when they need one.  The time has come for a complete reorganisation and reorientation so that there is an adequate number of gardaí on bikes or foot patrol, getting to know the people and their problems in a community.  A community garda will be the first to be called off his or her usual duty and reassigned to something else.Where community policing works it is an almost unmitigated success, according to the people, the residents' associations and the gardaí, but the Minister cannot get away with the semantic proposition that every garda is a community garda.  Is the lack of success of the civilianisation programme in which hundreds of gardaí are behind desks community policing because they interface with the public?  Are gardaí dealing with traffic offences or those in the serious crime unit community gardaí because they interface with some members of the public?  There is no commitment in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to true community policing, as expressed in many international documents and as supported by the Garda inspectorate here.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	There are gardaí in specialist units, whether involved in security, serious crime, national immigration bureau or plain clothes work, who are not publically visible.  The gardaí who are visible are not restricted to the category of community policeman.  It is not the case that only gardaí on patrol or on bicycles are community policemen.  The presence of gardaí in the community is not solely or exclusively dependent on community policemen.  That is an incontestable fact.I do not wish to have a "dialogue of the deaf" but I do wish to point out that community police perform an extremely valuable role in accessing local intelligence and liaising with local residents, but many of these problems are well identified and require a stronger and more vigorous Garda presence so they can be tackled than a solitary community policeman.  They also require the deployment of far more substantial resources than a community policeman.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It seems from the Minister's successive replies on this issue that his concept of the community garda is somewhat less than international best practice would advise.  In the circumstances there is no great change in what we are looking at, other than a label.  To my mind, that is wholly insufficient to meet the needs of modern communities.  The Minister adverted earlier to the fact that one of the major impediments to community policing — adding to the type of anti-social behaviour which is rampant throughout the country — is the widespread availability of alcohol.  The link between anti-social behaviour in communities and alcohol deserves urgent consideration on the part of the Minister.  Notwithstanding the ministerial reviews he has announced, will the Minister confirm to the House that the current review and forthcoming report will be treated more seriously by him and his Department than its predecessors under the chairmanship of Dr. Holmes?  I invite the Minister to——

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	It goes without saying that all gardaí have responsibility towards the communities they service.  The vision I have of a community policeman is someone who is highly visible, and uses the media almost the same way that politicians do, so that he or she is known right throughout the town or district concerned.  He or she must be seen in many clubs, handing out prizes.  Instead of being reactors, they should be preventers of crime taking place and work with the social services much of the time.  Does the Minister intend to provide any guidance to the Garda as regards a specific definition of community policing?  It is loose at the moment.  To say that all gardaí are community police is diluting the term, which needs to be more focused.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I agree with Deputy Doyle and that is why the Commissioner is undertaking this review — to arrive at a more precise definition of the responsibilities of the community policeman.As regards Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point concerning the ringfencing of traffic gardaí, many countries have a separate traffic corps.  In this jurisdiction, my predecessor maintained — I agree with him — that it is valuable to have the traffic corps as a direct part of the Garda Síochána.  It requires a separate dedicated assignment of personnel, however.  It is not desirable in other matters to have too rigid a division between community policemen and gardaí in local stations.  All of them exist to serve the community in the prevention, investigation and detection of crime.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of 28 February 2008, there are 3,377 members of the Garda Síochána who are competent in the use of firearms and who are authorised firearms card holders.  This includes members of specialist units such as the special detective unit as well as a percentage of uniformed gardaí.  A Garda working group on firearms training recommended that not more than 10% of the uniformed divisional strength, in addition to the detective branch, should be authorised or trained in firearms.  This enables high standards of training to be focused first and foremost on those members attached to units which are engaged in the investigation of serious crime and who are available when required.An Garda Síochána has just taken delivery of a dedicated firearms training range at the Garda College, Templemore.  This is an indoor four-lane modular live fire range.  A second similar indoor four-lane modular live fire range is being installed in Dublin and it is envisaged this range will be operational by April 2008.  These prefabricated modular firearms ranges are newly designed products and will facilitate live fire shooting for up to four persons in a carefully contained environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.

Has that situation improved?  She gave a particular incident to which gardaí were called where a person was using a serious weapon outside his own house.  In the event, the gardaí turned up with just a Smith and Wesson revolver to deal with the situation.Will the Minister assure the House that firearms and bullet-proof vests available to the Garda Síochána are of an approved standard?  Is he satisfied that sufficient numbers of gardaí are competent in using firearms?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The fundamental question asked by the Deputy related to training.  I have outlined in my answer the new initiatives which have been taken to ensure training in the use of firearms is first-class.  I have looked at the facilities available in Templemore and I am satisfied they are of the highest standard and will ensure that the continuous training which the Garda Síochána requires in this area will be provided.  That is a major improvement on the position commented on by the chief inspector.  As regards the particular weapons that may be used by the Garda Síochána, that is an operational matter for the Commissioner.  I will be guided by him as regards what is required to ensure the force is effective.As regards the arrangements made to provide protective body armour, at present two types are in use by the Garda Síochána.  All detectives are issued with protective vests that have bullet and stab-proof properties.  Uniformed personnel are issued with protection vests, which incorporate bullet and stab-proof properties.

It was initially established with officers seconded from various units.  In January of this year, the unit was established on a permanent basis and full-time staff have been assigned to it.  This new status has been awarded to the unit given the successes it has enjoyed over the past two years and in the light of the significant threat which continues to be posed by organised crime.In order to disrupt organised criminality, Garda operations are regularly put in place targeting both individuals and members of organised crime gangs who are suspected of involvement in criminal activity.  An Garda Síochána will continue to use intelligence-led operations against selected targets.  The success of operations such as Oak and Anvil are examples of recent Garda successes.The organised crime unit is being led by an officer at superintendent rank.  This officer reports to the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services via the chief superintendent in charge of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The unit currently operates with a staff of 70 members.  The allocation of this number of gardaí allows the unit to operate effectively against criminal gangs, and to carry out intelligence-led operations targeting their criminal activities.  The Garda Commissioner is keeping the strength of the unit under review, particularly as extra gardaí become available as the strength of the force increases.It would be a mistake for anyone in this House to assume that the 70 staff in the new organised crime unit comprise the only resource working to combat organised crime.  The Garda Commissioner utilises all of the resources available to him, whether they are from the specialist units, regional divisions or local police stations to address this problem.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The new unit will continue to work closely with the other specialist units, including the Garda national drugs unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the special detective unit and the emergency response unit in targeting those suspected of involvement in organised criminal activity.  The new organised crime unit has already been successful in identifying, profiling and targeting suspects associated with the main criminal gangs.  A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently, on foot of which firearms have been recovered and drugs seized.  This has resulted in a number of people associated with these groups being prosecuted and convicted before the courts.The Garda Commissioner and other senior gardaí will continue to monitor circumstances as they develop to ensure that the resources available to tackle particular problem areas are sufficient and appropriate.

The Minister stated the unit was established on a temporary basis last November.  Is it now permanent?  Is it based exclusively in Dublin and are the members from other parts of the country?  From what other sections of the Garda were personnel transferred to the unit?  Does the unit share personnel with the drug squad, bearing in mind that drug trafficking is the genesis of much of the serious crime in the country?  Will the Minister state whether drugs are a main focus of the specialist crime unit?

Officers were seconded from various units.  While the detection of drugs offences is a principle responsibility of the unit, it is not the only one.  Organised crime takes other forms also, including, for example, the acquisition of firearms.  The unit is constantly addressing the procurement of firearms.  Systematic burglaries and other types of organised crime can be targeted by the unit.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	118	The Deputy is crowing very early.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a few issues of real importance to the people.  In recent times, we have heard of patients having to wait up to 18 months for a colonoscopy, a simple procedure and test for the early diagnosis of cancer that can save lives.  Reports indicate delays of four months in Cork, nine months in Kerry, eight months in Wexford, 18 months in Portlaoise and up to 12 months in Tralee and Galway.  Consultants have said to me face to face in different hospitals that patients die because they are not seen as quickly as they should be seen.  The Minister for Health and Children, who is not present, says these delays are unacceptable, as if she were some sort of innocent bystander rather than the Minister responsible for the health service.What will the Taoiseach do to ensure that what happened to Susie Long — God rest her — does not happen to any other patient?  She could not get a colonoscopy on time.  In respect of colonoscopies, what has the Taoiseach to say about his comment that we are running a world-class health service in respect of which he should be congratulated?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Minister for Health and Children will be addressing some of these issues tomorrow during Question Time, but the HSE has advised us that colonoscopy scheduling is based on clinical need and that each patient is assessed individually by his general practitioner and referred accordingly.  Cases that are classified as urgent are given the next available time slot and patients are usually seen between two to three days and five weeks, depending on their geographical location.  There are big differences depending on geographical location.  The non-urgent cases are placed on a waiting list and a patient may wait from three to 18 months, again depending on geographical location.  The waiting period is based on the level of urgency attached to the case by the doctor.The waiting time for routine investigations can and will be reduced by making better use of existing capacity.  That is the point the Minister for Health and Children made.  The head of the cancer control programme, Professor Tom Keane, has said there are many unnecessary follow-up visits for certain patients after treatment and that resources could be far better used for initial investigations for new patients.  The professor plans to eliminate such unnecessary follow-up visits in developing clinical practice norms, which he believes will dramatically improve the service.It is important that clear criteria be applied to distinguish between urgent and routine cases.  Significant work has already been undertaken in the area of breast cancer, supported by the Irish College of General Practitioners in respect of referral criteria and the development of appropriate referral forms to allow for appropriate triage of urgent and non-urgent cases.  The lists about which we are talking can be very different depending on whether cases are regarded as urgent.Professor Keane also plans to develop and implement a referral process for other cancers, including colon cancer.  Hospitals are working closely with clinicians and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce waiting times.  Any patient waiting for over three months can be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Patients can self-refer or are referred by the hospital to the fund, and hospitals are currently validating their colonoscopy waiting lists by contacting patients on the list and determining whether the procedure is still required by them so that if the procedure is still required, the patient can be assessed for eligibility by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	120	That puts the buck back on the patient.  It is difficult for the Taoiseach to appreciate the frustration, anger and anxiety of these patients who are waiting on these lists, especially if he is away canvassing on another job.Four months in Cork, 12 months in both Tullamore and Galway are 18 months in Portlaoise are the times concerned for people who are on those waiting lists.  What they want to hear from the doctor or from the consultant is that they are all right and that there is nothing wrong with them, or that at least they will have their test carried out and the truth of the findings of that test will be made known to them.  That is what patients want to hear and patients want to find out that they will have that facility.Ms Suzie Long, before she died, wrote:I then came home, flicked on the tv and got into bed.  The first ad on the tv was from the government telling people that bowel cancer can kill, but not if caught in time.  If Bertie Ahern or Mary Harney or Michael McDowell were within reach I would have killed them.  Literally.  I'm not joking.That young girl is dead because she did not get a colonoscopy in time.  I am telling the Taoiseach that these are not phantom lists.  These lists are real evidence of people, some of whom consultants have stated will die because they will not be seen on time.If the Taoiseach was interested, or if the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was sufficiently interested, instead of being a bystander she would see to it that the HSE receive instructions and directions from Government to implement Government policy.  First, will the Taoiseach and the Minister direct the HSE that there be clear guidelines set out for who should be seen and who should not be seen?  Second, will the Taoiseach direct the HSE to set a target time of six weeks for every person who needs a colonoscopy to be seen?  Third, will he direct the HSE to use this very expensive equipment lying idle every weekend in every hospital to maximum capacity to reduce these waiting lists?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I repeat that of course this is urgent, and hugely so for the people concerned — there is no issue about that.In answer to the question on waiting times, those who are classified as urgent get the next available time slot and that works out usually at between two to three days and five weeks, depending on the geographical location.  Therefore, they would all be within the period to which Deputy Kenny referred.An issue is what is urgent and non-urgent.  If one is a patient and one is worried, everything is urgent.  I understand that but that is the classification that is made.Professor Keane has stated that in his view of these follow-ups for certain patients for treatment, resources would be far better used for investigations on new patients and that would help these waiting lists dramatically, and he plans to eliminate these follow-ups in developing clinical practice norms.  As I stated about the procedures, significant work has already been undertaken in the area of breast cancer, supported by general practitioners, to get a criteria for the development of appropriate referral norms — that work is being done.  I will not go back over what I said about the national treatment fund.Recruitment of the additional consultants under the new consultant contract will be of significant benefit to the HSE's national cancer control programme because it is designed to give a far better service to public patients in particular.  It is based on four to one — four public patients to one private patient.  Under that contract outpatient and diagnostic services will be provided in public hospitals on a one-for-all basis so patients can be seen in order of medical need at this key entry point to acute hospital services.The Minister has asked the board of the National Cancer Screening Service to advise her on the introduction of the national cancer screening programme, and that advice will be available mid-year and be informed by screening programmes in place or planned in other countries, including the UK.  The service has also requested the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to conduct an assessment of the colon-rectal cancer screening programme as well.On the reports, I understand two of the reports are cleared to be published and the Minister hopes to do that.  The third report is awaiting a legal clearance, which she hopes will be cleared shortly, but about which she cannot be certain.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The Taoiseach does not understand this problem at all.  The distinction he is making between urgent and non-urgent is missing the point.  I listened to Dr. Martin Daly speaking on radio the other morning where he made the distinction between urgent and non-urgent.  Urgent is where a general practitioner concludes that somebody is already sick and must be seen immediately.  Non-urgent is where a general practitioner is concerned that there are some symptoms that need to be checked out.Suzie Long's case was non-urgent.  That is why she waited seven months.  She is now dead.  Last October I raised her case here with the Taoiseach at the request of her family.  They were concerned that no other patient would have to suffer as she and her family suffered, and that a test, which in any decent health service would be available within a matter of days or certainly weeks, took seven months for her.We have reports that people are waiting up to 18 months for a colonoscopy because, the Taoiseach states, they are non-urgent.  He makes it sound like it is some kind of cosmetic procedure they are looking for.  These are people who doctors have concluded need to be checked out and they must wait 18 months.As the Taoiseach wandered around Europe last week, and in all of his visits to various European capitals, has he found any other country where people must wait 18 months for a cancer test?  Our health service is a disgrace.  His Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, describes it as not acceptable that people should have to wait that length of time for a cancer test.  Neither is it acceptable to have a Minister for Health and Children presiding over that kind of system, and it is not acceptable that a Government that has been in office for almost 11 years has allowed this to happen.  Even when somebody gets a cancer test, he or she has no guarantee that the test will turn out to be accurate.  We are now waiting for seven reports on the various inaccuracies there have been in cancer tests that we know about in Portlaoise, Cork, Galway and other centres.This week we find an attempt at covering it up.  The Irish Examiner, in an article this week, quotes from emails between the current Government press secretary and the former Government press secretary:In consultation with the Department of Health and Children, it was decided not to go into detail in relation to the numbers of patients involved . . . Doing so would only serve to cause widespread alarm in the public and unnecessary confusion in the media.They were referring to how many patients had been seen by the Finnish consultant who was employed in Cork and whose contract has been terminated.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I repeat it is not an assessment of urgent and non-urgent that I am making.  It is one that the relevant consultants are making.  Cases are classified as urgent by the general practitioner who refers the person to the consultant.  They are making the call as to whether it is urgent, not an administrative person.  The urgent cases are given the next available time slot and patients are usually seen within two to three days.  In some areas, where clearly there is not a good system in place, it is within five weeks.  That is based on the geographical location.  The non-urgent cases are placed on waiting lists and the waiting time varies significantly from three to 18 months.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The waiting time for routine investigations will be reduced by making better use of existing capacity, which is what Professor Keane said.  He believes there are several ways this can be done and the HSE is working with general practitioners to achieve that.  Any patient waiting over three months can be referred, or self refer, to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, as a high proportion are already.There are three reports in question with regard to breast radiology services at the Midland Regional Hospital.  The clinical review of breast radiology diagnosis from November 2003 to August 2007, when the issue was highlighted, was led by Dr. Ann O'Doherty, consultant radiologist in St. Vincent's.  That review has been completed and the HSE expects to publish it in the next few days, perhaps even tomorrow, but I cannot be more definite about that.The Minister for Health and Children has asked the chief executive officer of the HSE for a report on the circumstances that led to the decisions of the HSE to suspend breast radiology services at the hospital, to place a consultant radiologist on administrative leave and to initiate a clinical review of the breast radiology service.  This report, by the review group led by Ms Ann Doherty of the National Hospitals Office, has been submitted to the Minister and I believe is ready for publication.The Minister has also asked for a report from the board of the HSE on the management of all events, starting from and subsequent to those decisions.  Mr. John Fitzgerald has also submitted that report to the Minister.  She intends to publish both of those reports, with her considered views and response, tomorrow.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The Taoiseach makes it sound as though the consultants are out there organising queues, one line for urgent cases and another line for non-urgent cases.  The reason cases are designated as urgent is because there is an 18-month queue and consultants must do something with people they have concluded are ill.  If the Taoiseach or I went to the doctor and he recommended we get a colonoscopy, we would not wait 18 months to get it done.  I do not see why the Taoiseach and his Government should expect people who do not have the money to pay for the service to wait for it either.  Just because somebody is not sufficiently well-off to be able to go to a private facility and pay for a test or to have the level of insurance that will provide that test quickly does not mean they should be put at greater risk of dying, which is what is happening.The Taoiseach has not been able to tell me of any country in Europe with a longer waiting list than Ireland for these tests.  He is, and has been, the first out of the traps to claim credit for everything good that has happened here for the past ten or eleven years, but he refuses to take responsibility for what is going wrong.  He specifically refuses to take responsibility for what is happening in the health service.  Every time he is asked a question about it, he finds a consultant, doctor or administrator somewhere whom he asks to carry the can.Susie Long was very clear about who was responsible when she told Joe Duffy that she blamed the Government.   Frankly, so do I.  I ask the Taoiseach again to explain the e-mails that have been passing between his Government press secretary and his predecessor about covering up what happened in Cork.  That is what this is about.

The Deputy wants to keep talking about the 18-month wait.  Let me tell him for the third time that cases classified as urgent get the next available slot, which is between two and three days for the majority of these, and, at the bad end, the wait goes to five weeks.  That is the information available.The waiting time for non-urgent cases — I already explained what Professor Tom Keane said about this issue — ranges from three to 18 months.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I wish to try to continue discussion on the crisis in the health service.  I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, to call on the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to change their plans for the removal of the Dóchas centre, a one-stop-shop for breast cancer patients, from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin; the urgent need to maintain this important service for women in the north-east region in view of the constantly higher levels of cancer there, which are always above the national average, 12% to 13%; and commit to enhancing cancer treatment and prevention rather than removing facilities as is currently the case.  There is a clear need for debate on this issue.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to urgently appoint an inspector from his Department to assess the serious health and safety concerns of residents of Carndonagh Road in Donaghmede and all local residents with regard to the operations carried out by Barnmore Demolition in the Baldoyle industrial estate.  Previous communications from me and local residents to Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council have been ignored.  I ask the Minister to intervene, take charge and appoint an independent official from his Department to look at this urgent health issue.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Will the Taoiseach report on his contacts with the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children on the delay in opening the autism unit in Castleknock?  I raised this matter with him last week and received a reply.Has the Taoiseach confirmed the date for the referendum on the EU reform treaty?  Will it be held at the end of May or in early June?  I ask this because Fine Gael wants to lay out its programme of public meetings and get on with its schedule of supporting the treaty publicly and strongly.  I would like to know the date of the referendum as soon as possible in order that we can make those arrangements.The Electricity (Transfer of Transmission Assets) Bill, No. 38 on the list, concerns the transfer of ownership of the transmission assets from the ESB to EirGrid.  Is the Bill still on the cards following the recent announcement by the Minister or is it dead?In respect of the Human Tissue Bill, No. 59 on the list, the Taoiseach has met parents of children whose organs were confiscated and retained by hospitals without authorisation.  Under the Human Tissue Bill, no human tissue can be retained without authorisation.  In the light of the ongoing concerns of parents of children whose organs were retained, is it the Government's position that it wishes to discover the truth about this issue and will this be done by way of a public inquiry or other method in order that the people concerned can bring an end to what has been a very sensitive and personal saga for them for 20 years?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	157	In respect of the referendum Bill, I will have a word with the Deputy about the date but we are talking about early June.In respect of the Human Tissue Bill, a consultative forum was held last year which was followed by a national consultation on draft proposals for the legislation.  The analysis of submissions received in response to the consultation process is nearing completion and discussions are ongoing with major stakeholders on issues identified from the submissions.  It is expected that the proposals and the scope of the legislation should be known shortly.In respect of the Electricity (Transfer of Transmission Assets) Bill, the Department is undertaking an analysis and discussion of all dimensions, including legal and financial issues, to ensure the optimum outcome on foot of the transfer process for both the ESB and EirGrid.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Certainly.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I know the Taoiseach is very much aware of the appalling killing of two young Polish men last week.  I have previously raised the issue of the level of violence and the level related to alcohol or its availability.  A review of off-licences was promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When is it likely to be completed?  It appears that there is considerable growth in the number of off-licences.  According to Deputy Upton, there were 15 applications for planning permission for off-licences in her constituency in recent times, 14 of which were granted.  We can all repeat this story.I understand the Seanad has completed its consideration of the Defamation Bill but that it has not yet been introduced in the Dáil.  One of its provisions concerns an arrangement whereby a judge can give a direction to a jury in a defamation case as to the amount of compensation that might be awarded.  When is the Bill likely to be brought before the Dáil?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The Defamation Bill has reached Report Stage in the Seanad and will be brought here as soon as Report and Final Stages are completed in the Seanad.  The review of off-licences will be finished by the end of this month.  The Minister is hopeful that legislation will pass through the House before the summer.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	163	In the context of previous questions about the date on which the referendum on the EU reform treaty will be held and when the Bill will be published, when will a copy of the treaty be made available for the people to peruse?  There is a crying need for that to happen.  When will we receive the White Paper that was promised?  Will we receive a copy of the Attorney General's advice on the constitutional grounds for the referendum in order that the House which must approve the legislation will have an opportunity to see what precisely it is voting for?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The White Paper is due at the end of the month.  It is not normal to present the Attorney General's advice on a Bill but in respect of the discussions that took place, we will certainly try to give as much information as we can.  I have already answered the question on the date of publication of the Bill.  Of course, I will include Deputy Gilmore.  I will check the matter with him.

Maybe himself and Deputy Costello would arrange for public readings of the full text at St. Luke's some evening or perhaps take it chapter by chapter.I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the Immigration, Protection and Residency Bill in the context of the story on the front page of The Irish Times today about the manner of the discharge of functions of the tribunal.  I wish to ask about the assertion by our former colleague, Michael O’Kennedy, that his record and that of others was misrepresented before the Supreme Court by the chairman of the tribunal.  Does the Taoiseach know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has very uniquely provided in that Bill that the current chairman shall continue ex officio under the new arrangements provided for in the Bill?  Does the Taoiseach have any reservations about the current chairman continuing in that role, given what has been asserted this morning, if that version is correct?

It is good to see so many Green Party colleagues in the House for the Order of Business.  The father of the Green movement has stated that carbon offsetting is a waste of time.  Has the Taoiseach given any thought to abandoning the annual exodus of Ministers for St. Patrick's day, including the Minister for Transport who is so badly needed here?

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Last October, in response to the latest gangland killing, the Taoiseach contemplated the introduction of legislation to allow for special non-jury courts for gangland crime.  The following day, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated his intention to proceed to legislate for reform of electronic surveillance.  Where stand both of those initiatives some five months later?  They have not been heard of.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	That issue was not for legislation but it was to be reviewed within the Department and the agencies.  That report is awaited.

Does this mean we will have it before the Easter break?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I do not believe that will be available before the Easter break.

When will this happen and will the Taoiseach consider this request?  Not alone did Deputy Mansergh call for their sale, but so did Senator Donie Cassidy.  They involve a substantial cost for taxpayers, including an ongoing cost for their storage.

I tabled some parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recently.  While she mentioned the legislation she did not give a date.  Obviously important decisions will be made regarding the development of our foreshore for matters such as wind energy and it is important to have the legislation modernised to make it as transparent as possible.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The Bill is the foreshore amendment Bill.  I do not have a date.

We are only getting the kind of information that we are getting on health through freedom of information requests.  It is in the legislative programme.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Bill is due, but I do not have a date for it.  There is a detailed discussion paper on this and the Bill has been prepared in the Department and forwarded to the HSE and HIQA for their comments.  That is awaited.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	257	——more urgently needed now than ever.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I was somewhat surprised at the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Tuffy's question about the amendment to the foreshore legislation.  Just prior to the general election, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government sent a letter, a copy of which I have, to the effect that if his party were in Government no further permits would be given for offshore wind farms pending the amendment of the foreshore legislation.  I ask the Taoiseach whether it remains the position that no further permits will be given for offshore wind farms until the foreshore legislation isamended.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The foreshore amendment Bill, which is under the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is in preparation.  I think some designation of functions issues have to be resolved in that area, but the legislation is due.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Principal Act is amended in section 198 by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3D)—"(3E) The landlord in receipt of a payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable of a tenant shall, as soon as practicable, submit to the Health Service Executive the registration details of the tenancy where registration is required by section 134 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.".I have tabled a number of amendments which deal with the issue of rent supplement.  We discussed rent supplement in some detail on Committee Stage.  It is an area in need of urgent reform.  The Committee of Public Accounts is pursuing the matter separately in respect of the tax implications of how the supplement is paid at the moment.  I have listed a number of aspects of rent supplement that need urgent attention.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to addressing those anomalies at this point rather than putting them off further.  It is a very expensive scheme, costing approximately €420 million a year.  If that amount of taxpayers' money is being transferred into the hands of private landlords, there is an onus on the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that when the money is received proper tax is paid on it.  The system works from the point of view of the taxpayer and from that of the recipient of the rent supplement.The amendment proposes that it be a requirement for the payment of rent supplement that a landlord be registered with the PRTB.  That is a very basic requirement that should be in place.  The PRTB legislation required landlords to be registered.  There is a considerable problem in that many landlords appear to be not yet registered even though the PRTB has been in place for a number of years.  The amendment proposes to close the loophole so that the Department of Social and Family Affairs in transferring substantial public money to landlords would have as a minimum requirement that landlords be registered with the PRTB.I am sure the Minister will say that his Department relays that information about landlords and the rent supplements paid to the PRTB.  That is much more difficult to see through.  My amendment proposes a seamless system requiring a landlord to be registered before the rent supplement is paid.  I cannot see any argument against it.  They are already required in law to be registered.  This is just a double check on that if they expect to receive rent supplement.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Under the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  It is a matter for the PRTB to ensure that landlords comply with the requirements of the Act.  Neither my Department nor the Health Service Executive has a role in this matter and it would be an unnecessary duplication of functions for either body to take on a monitoring role regarding the registration of tenancies.  The Department supports the requirement that tenancies facilitated by rent supplement should be registered with the PRTB and is working with the PRTB to achieve this.  The Department provides the PRTB with rent supplement data for checking against its register of tenancies so that it can check compliance regarding tenancy registration and take follow-up action as required.  That is already the law and those with responsibility for its implementation are already in place.  We try to assist them in doing that.  To have a double responsibility is simply a further duplication.  The law is the law and people should adhere to it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Minister cannot simply wash his hands of this.  He has already said in respect of tax that it is nothing to do with him.  If we are to have a properly regulated private rented sector, the Department of Social and Family Affairs should play its part in ensuring that people are registered.  Instead of opting out, the Minister should opt in and ensure proper regulation, which could be done very simply by amending the Act as I propose.  I do not see any justification for not accepting the amendment.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I agree with the points made by Deputy Shortall.  There is a real attitude that so long as the Department does its bit it does not matter and it is not its problem.  It is still taxpayers' money coming from the same Central Fund.  I read the report the Department of Social and Family Affairs officials gave to the Committee of Public Accounts last week.  The Secretary General admitted, as the Minister has, that the Department does not follow up with the PRTB.  She said later on that the Department is trying to work its way through legal issues to ascertain how it can pull the three areas together.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten the House as to what legal issues his Department is working through in this area so that we can understand where the problems are.  At first it seemed clear it was not doing anything.  Then there seemed to be some degree of openness to doing something.  Just notifying the Private Residential Tenancies Board and doing nothing else shows a very casual attitude to taxpayers' money.  I understand and accept what the Minister says about not wanting to penalise the Department's customer who needs the rental property.  I do not want to see such persons penalised either but those in receipt of money, either directly from the Department or through the tenants paid by it, should pay tax.  An all-sided approach should be taken to this matter, rather than saying "We did our bit and do not really care what happens after that," which seems to be the attitude adopted to date.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Perhaps I was misunderstood or did not make my point clearly but the Department already provides the PRTB with all of that information.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Yes but it does nothing else.  It does not check the system.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Does the Deputy want the Department to take over the role of the Private Rental Tenancies Board?  We provide the PRTB with the information.  There is a legal obligation on those involved to register with the board.  Deputy Shortall makes the point that when a client of ours is going to agree that one should be registered, he or she cannot register in advance of taking possession of the property and paying rent.  The law does not allow for it to be done in advance but the legal basis which is strong and solid is in place.  It would be wrong to make social welfare clients responsible.  We pass all information to the PRTB to be followed up by it.  As the body legally appointed by the Oireachtas, it deals with the matter.  If the Oireachtas is of the view that it is not doing its job, that is another issue.  However, we certainly provide all information above and beyond what is required of us to ensure people are compliant.  Equally, we work on issues with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure Revenue is fully up to date on the people to whom rent is paid.  Primarily, we pay rent allowance to individual social welfare recipients, not landlords.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Is the Minister trying to pull the three issues together?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	272	We are trying to be as helpful as we can in ensuring everybody is compliant.  In the amendment Deputy Shortall is effectively suggesting the Department should take responsibility and that somehow the matter should come under its aegis but I do not agree.  There is a properly constituted legal entity which has the responsibility and legal weight to deal with the matter and it should get on with dealing with it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	273	In other arenas there are further stipulations for those in receipt of public moneys.  For example, a requirement that a person be tax compliant is standard practice.  There is, therefore, no difficulty in principle with requiring landlords to be registered and have proof that they have complied with the law.  As the Minister knows, his Department pays rent allowance in arrears.  Therefore, after a lease is signed, there is a period of one month in which the landlord can register and produce proof of registration before rent allowance is paid at the end of the month.  It could be done if there was a will to do so.  However, it is not being done, precisely because there are gaps in the exchange of information between the Department, the PRTB and the Revenue Commissioners.  Far from the Department facilitating Revenue in acquiring the information, it has not done so.  In addition, there have been serious problems with the computer system.  In general, the Department's IT system has not been good.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Is the Deputy suggesting that if a landlord does not register, the Department should withdraw the money from the social welfare recipient?
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Yes, I am.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Is the Deputy suggesting the social welfare recipient should be punished and left homeless because somebody else will not do his or her job?  It is an interesting concept that the Labour Party is bringing forward.  That is the alternative but it is not fair.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The first amendment which was ruled out of order proposed that the Department change the system by which it pays rent supplement and that it pay it in advance.  Under the landlord-tenant legislation, rent is required to be paid in advance.  Unusually, however, the Department will not do this — it pays the supplement in arrears.  Last week, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I brought to the attention of the Secretary General the findings of a recent survey of landlords carried out by Threshold.  Landlords were asked why they were loath to become involved in the rent supplement scheme. The primary reason they raised was that one had to wait one month to receive rent in arrears, unlike any other tenants where rent is received in advance.  We need to examine this system in the round and find out why tenants find it so difficult to identify landlords who are prepared to accept rent supplement.  If the area was better regulated, it would provide a level playing pitch for everybody.  There are so many gaps in the information made available between the three State agencies involved, which is why the Committee of Public Accounts will play a role in trying to close them.  It will try to bring the agencies together in order that there will be a tighter regime and a more highly regulated system.  I hope that will happen in the coming months.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3—The Principal Act is amended in section 198 by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3D)—"(3E) (i) The payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable by a person in respect of his or her residence shall be paid in its entirety by the Health Service Executive to the landlord.(ii) The tenant shall pay to the Health Service Executive the portion of the rent for which they are liable.".The amendment proposes to tackle the issue we discussed earlier, whereby in more than three quarters of rent supplement cases rent supplement is paid directly to the tenant.  There are a couple of reasons this is a mistake.  We must bear in mind that the new rental accommodation scheme does not operate in such a way.  Public representatives who have been involved in such cases will agree that the scheme is popular and successful.  In such cases rent is paid directly to the landlord.  Apart from other attractive aspects of the scheme, the fact that the rent is paid directly to the landlord frees up tenants.One of the most important aspects is that, as well having a substantial part of the rent met by rent supplement, another portion is paid by the tenant.  We are also seeing a third element, the top-up that increasing numbers of tenants are required to pay.  These additional top-ups are completely illegal because the official documentation has the rent at X amount, whereas the landlord is receiving X amount plus €50 per week.  This is increasingly become a common phenomenon whereby illegal top-ups are sought.  If rent was paid directly to the landlord, as happens under the rental accommodation scheme, it would eliminate that practice of bleeding tenants dry.  We know that many tenants in receipt of rent supplement are particularly vulnerable and, thus, open to exploitation.  If rent was paid directly to landlords, it would certainly eliminate that practice.The other reason this change would make sense is that it would be possible to keep close tabs on who was receiving rent.  It would provide a means of ensuring the proper amount in tax would be paid on rent received.  Given the vast amount of public money, some €420 million, that goes on rent supplement, taxpayers have a right to expect that adequate levels of tax are being paid by landlords in receipt of the money.For both of these reasons and because the system under which rent is paid directly to landlords has proved so successful under the rental accommodation scheme, I strongly propose that we switch to that system in respect of rent supplement.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I want to raise two issues concerning amendment No. 18.  The first is somewhat similar to the issue Deputy Shortall has discussed.  There is another aspect to this.  I am sure all Members have spoken to tenants who are paying a top-up to their landlord.  This is illegal and indicates a difficulty that exists in the system.  Tenants in those circumstances have little option because if the rent on the accommodation exceeds the qualifying limit, they will not receive the supplement.  Some tenants, therefore, are giving landlords significant sums of money to secure accommodation.The other problem is that in particular areas, one is almost bound to be over the limit because of the high market rents.  This is causing difficulties for tenants who are often not in a position to provide a top-up and so cannot secure the desired property.  Surveys conducted by Threshold indicate this as a significant issue, as did other pre-budget submissions.  Given a choice between a prospective tenant in receipt of rent supplement and another who can pay up-front, landlords will choose the latter.  It may indicate a lack of social consciousness on the part of landlords but it is understandable.This issue was raised at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand the Department looked into the possibility of paying up-front and that the estimated cost was in the region of €10 million to €12 million.  This seems a remarkably high figure given that the length of time in which tenants will be in accommodation will not change.  Does this figure represent a once-off sum to effect the changeover or a recurring annual cost?We raised the issue of the quality of accommodation on Committee Stage.  The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, will deal with this issue but that will only be of benefit to those who are eligible under the scheme.  I have spoken to dozens of people in receipt of the rent supplement whose basis for seeking a house from the local authority is the poor quality of their current accommodation.  When these people secure local authority accommodation, somebody else moves into the inadequate accommodation and subsequently seeks local authority housing.  It is a perpetual problem that must be addressed, although the Minister will probably say it is not a matter for his Department.  Rent supplement should only be paid in respect of decent accommodation that provides people with adequate living conditions.  That should be addressed in the Bill.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the community welfare service division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department's relationship is with the tenant in all cases.  Payment is made to the tenant, is the property of the tenant and is specifically for the benefit of the tenant to assist him or her with accommodation needs.  As with other social welfare payments, recipients may nominate an agent to receive payment on their behalf.  There are more than 60,000 rent supplements in payment and 13,000 tenants have chosen to have rent supplement paid directly to their landlord.  These arrangements are made at the request of the tenant.  Payments made directly to a landlord or his or her agent may be a simple matter of convenience for the tenant.  In some cases, the tenant may have an addiction or other personal problems that could impinge on their ability to meet their rental payments.  Paying directly to the agent, landlord or other third party ensures the rent is paid and removes a certain burden from individual tenants.The social welfare allowance scheme, including rent supplement, has a clear role in providing support to individuals and families and in alleviating poverty and social exclusion.  The scheme is designed to enable immediate and flexible assistance to be provided to those in need.  At a policy level, measures are in place to remove the disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.  An example of this is the earnings disregard in certain circumstances for those in receipt of rent supplement.  The advantage of the current arrangement for the payment of rent supplement, particularly in the short term, is that it provides recipients with a degree of flexibility in terms of the freedom to move to a different location and allows them time to seek alternative long-term housing solutions provided by their local authority.  The tailoring of additional payments such as rent supplement to meet the specific needs of individuals and making those payments directly to the tenant is regarded as an effective way of helping individuals realise their potential and take individual responsibility.As already stated, the purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation.  In July 2004, the Government responded to the significant number of recipients on long-term rent supplement by introducing new rental assistance arrangements giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of the 32,000 people in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more.  When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a variety of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the new public private partnership type rental accommodation scheme, RAS.The local authority has a direct contractual relationship with the landlord in RAS tenancies.  As part of that contract, the local authority makes payments directly to the landlord.  Long-term recipients of rent supplement are gradually being transferred to RAS.  Of the 11,000 tenants transferred from rent supplement by local authorities, 5,964 have transferred to RAS and some 3,000 are now in private sector accommodation leased by local authorities.  It is envisaged that a further 5,000 transfers will take place in 2008.  The objective is to complete the transfer of rent supplement recipients with long-term housing needs to local authorities by the end of next year.  This roll-out of RAS will increase the numbers of landlords who have contracts with the local authorities and who will receive direct payment of rent as a result.My Department fully supports RAS as a solution to the long-term housing requirements of eligible persons.  Provisions in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 enable those accepted as eligible for RAS to return to full-time employment and retain entitlement to rent supplement subject to the standard qualifying conditions.  My Department will work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long-term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role as a short-term income support.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that any applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain suitable basic rented accommodation having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.In January 2007, a review was completed of the maximum levels of rents a person may incur and still be eligible to receive rent supplement.  The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits applicable from January 2007 until June 2008.  This review included consultation with the Health Service Executive, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.  This process ensures rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the State.  Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards from January 2007 for several household types in 14 counties.  I intend to have rent limits reviewed this year with a view to implementing from 1 July 2008 any revision found to be necessary.  A consultative approach will again be used to conduct the review.

He has done so on several occasions recently, as has his Secretary General.  This is to refer to the rent supplement scheme as a short-term measure.  That may have been the objective when it was introduced but it is no longer the case.  The figures from the Department indicate that more than 50% of rent supplement recipients are in receipt of it for 18 months or more.

Irrespective of long-term plans, the reality is that the rent supplement scheme is a critical element of current housing strategy, whether we like it or not.  The Minister must deal with this reality.The Minister referred to those in receipt of rent supplement on a long-term basis being transferred to RAS.  That is fine in theory, but in practice the reality is that the number of units which are available under the scheme is completely inadequate.  Some 1,200 people are on the scheme's waiting list in the Dublin city area.  Many people have contacted me to tell me they would love to participate in the scheme, but not enough units are available for them.  Those who are waiting have no choice but to remain on rent supplement in the meantime and for the foreseeable future.  If the Minister speaks to any of the officials dealing with the rental accommodation scheme at local level, he will learn that the same thing is happening in most of this country's big suburban areas.In his lengthy commentary on the rent supplement scheme, the Minister made no reference to the issue of illegal top-ups, with which all Deputies are familiar.  It is a silent issue in that it is just beneath the surface, but it is real nonetheless.  Tenants in vulnerable circumstances are caught in a bind.  They have no choice but to pay the illegal top-ups which are demanded.  The Minister knows this is a widespread problem, but he has not responded to my comments on it.  What does he intend to do to deal with the issue of tenants being required to pay illegal top-ups?  What action will be taken against landlords who illegally impose such charges on tenants, having declared that their rent is a certain amount?  What will the Minister do about it?  Can I ask the Chair whether time restrictions apply to this debate?

Such an interim measure could solve many problems of this nature.  We know the rental accommodation scheme eliminates the poverty trap for people who want to get into work.  If the Minister applies the same limits to people on rent supplement who are in private rented accommodation, he will deal with their critical income problems.  The Minister said on Committee Stage he would give consideration to this proposal.  Has he done so?

Figures made available by the Department of Social and Family Affairs indicate that a substantial number of people participate in the scheme for at least 18 months, which is a significant period.  I welcome the Minister's decision to review the limits which apply to the scheme.  They need to be reviewed on an ongoing basis as the rental market fluctuates.  I await the outcome of the Minister's review in July.  We need to deal with the issue of top-up payments.  If those who are asked to make such payments do not do so, they will have nowhere to live.  If they make payments they cannot afford, they will be pushed further into poverty.  That is the difficulty they face, in effect.  I understand that such payments are illegal.  We need to find a solution that ensures such payments are no longer demanded.  As we do not have accurate figures for the scale of this problem, we have to rely on what people are telling us.  I am concerned that it is quite widespread.  The most vulnerable people in our society are being given very little choice.  I ask the Minister to comment specifically on that point.  I have spoken previously about the cost of paying in advance, rather than in arrears.

Will it be between €10 million and €12 million, as has been suggested?  While it may be a one-off measure, we should not close the door on it.  I ask the Minister to keep an open mind in this regard.  His Department should prepare a report on it, at least, so we can discuss whether it is a viable option.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The substantial process that is under way recognises that the rent supplement scheme is starting to be used to support people on rent supplement in the long term, which is not what it was originally designed to do.  It was designed to assist individuals with a specific need for a short period until they could sort themselves out.  When it was observed that the scheme had expanded beyond what was originally intended, the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government started to work with the local authorities on the rental accommodation scheme.  As I said in my reply, we hope to complete that process by the end of next year.  The local authorities are not capable of doing it overnight.  It is intended that when that process has been completed, the rent supplement scheme will revert to its original purpose as a scheme under which short-term individual payments can be made in individual circumstances to support those who need such help.  We are now trying to bring the scheme back to what it should be, in line with many of the points made by Deputies Shortall and Enright.  I accept that it will take some time, but I do not accept that we are doing nothing.  Time will tell whether the process that is under way will be successful.  The points made by Deputies Shortall and Enright today and in previous debates will be taken into account in the review of the rent supplement scheme that is under way.  Many people who receive payments under the scheme are being asked to make top-up payments and meet all sorts of conditions.  Such matters will come to the fore when I see what the position is on foot of the review.  I have not ignored the issue.  I listened carefully the other day.  Colleagues on all sides of the House have approached me on this issue.  We will have a look at it.

Those who are stuck in the poverty trap of rent supplement should be treated in the same way as those who receive payments under the rental accommodation scheme.  It is obvious that the experience of the rent supplement scheme was drawn on when the rental accommodation scheme was being established.  In the case of the rental accommodation scheme, it was decided that rent payments would be made directly to the landlord.  I have outlined several good reasons we should switch to such a system in the case of the rent supplement scheme.  The Minister should not hide behind the argument that his responsibility is to the client.  He is responsible for ensuring we have a viable private rental sector that serves vulnerable people.  Such people would benefit from being able to avail of the terms which apply to the rental assistance scheme.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on restricting the number of rent supplement recipients to 20 per cent in a given location.This amendment was the subject of considerable discussion on Committee Stage.  I propose that a quota system be applied to the payment of rent supplement for any single apartment development or housing estate.  I suggest that a limit of 20% be operated because experience has taught us that the nature and character of a housing development can change substantially, in a negative way, when an undue proportion of those living in the development are on rent supplement.  The social balance within developments can be skewed in such circumstances.  In response to the shortage of building land in the Dublin city area, Dublin City Council has recently started to buy back properties in various parts of the city, or acquire them for the first time, to rent them out, rather than building houses from scratch.  The council's practice of buying properties and then letting them to people who are on the housing list has operated successfully over recent years.  We know that problems can arise when an excessive number of social housing units in a single development are rented out in such a manner.  For that reason, a maximum of 20% of houses in any area can be bought under the council's buy-back policy.  I suggest we apply the same kind of quota system to rent supplement.  I remind the Minister that on Committee Stage he sympathised with what I was trying to achieve and said he had first-hand experience of the difficulties caused.  He also indicated he would give consideration to the matter.  I hope that in the past week or so he has had an opportunity to do so and will accede to the amendment.

We have managed to do this in other areas, particularly with social and affordable housing provisions.  I know that is simpler because in such an instance we deal with a brand new estate and the location is clear.  It would be done on that basis.It is not only with those in receipt of rent supplement but with people in general who do not have a long-term interest in a particular property where difficulties can arise.  This is an issue which merits examination.  There is a figure of 20%; it can be somewhere in that region.  I have received complaints from some areas about this matter.  During the last general election difficulties were more apparent in some areas than in others.  I could see it easily at times as I was going around.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	301	In general, there is no limit or restriction on the proportion or number who may receive rent supplement in an area.  However, section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides that payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as being an area of regeneration.  This provision is aimed at supporting Government investment in regeneration and attaining a good social mix between private, social and affordable and voluntary housing.  The measures provided for in section 25 are not to be seen as a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration.  Specific provision is made to ensure people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement can continue to receive payment.  People already residing in such areas in rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted.As I stated during the course of the debate on this amendment on Committee Stage, I will speak to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to see if we can extend the designations under the scheme.  The programme for Government includes commitments to reduce long-term reliance on rent supplement.  This would be done mainly by keeping the standard means test for rent supplement under review to provide enhanced financial incentives for people taking up employment and providing long-term housing solutions under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review.  My Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring the RAS meets its objective of catering for those in receipt of long-term rent supplement, while enabling the rent supplement scheme to return to its original role of providing short-term income support.

To say what happens in areas of regeneration is beside the point, as that provision enables local authorities to refuse rent allowance on the grounds of the need to ensure a better social mix in such areas.  There is no reference to the principle of a quota system.  We are not just speaking about areas of regeneration but also about many areas around the country where we know difficulties are caused by an over-reliance on rent supplement by local authorities or particular community welfare officers.  Very often, it is not in the interests of people living in those housing schemes to have a substantial number in receipt of rent supplement.  The Minister knows this to be the case because he explained on Committee Stage that there were serious problems and that he had first-hand experience.  He has done nothing to deal with this issue and has not given me one reason he cannot go with a quota system, other than what seems to be a determination not to accept any proposal from this side of the House.  Unfortunately, he was like this in his previous role.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on ensuring that 20 per cent of rent supplement is withheld from direct payments to non-resident landlords."This is the final amendment pertaining to rent supplement.  It relates to the ludicrous position where a tenant in receipt of rent supplement, in cases where the landlord is non-resident, is legally required to withhold 20% of the rent and pay it to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the landlord under the Finance Act.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is ridiculous but that there is a legal requirement on the tenant to do so.My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, drew attention to this issue recently and it certainly needs attention.  When it was raised recently at the Committee of Public Accounts with representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, their response was that the number of non-resident landlords in receipt of rent supplement was small; therefore, it was not a significant issue.  That is a completely inadequate response.  If there is a system under which public money is paid to landlords who are non-resident, there should at least be a system in place to ensure tax returns are made on that income.  It does not appear to make sense that the obligation to make returns to Revenue is on tenants but that is the way it is.  The purpose of the amendment is to bring an end to that practice.  We do not know if they are deducting 20% or if there are any checks made.  We do not know any of the information but in theory that is the position.The objective of the amendment is to bring to an end this obligation on tenants, which is nonsensical, and place it on the Department which pays the cheques.  In other circumstances there are State agencies withholding 20% DIRT, for example.  It does not seem to be too much to expect the Minister's Department to be able to do this.  It seems the only reason to refuse to do so is the Department's IT system is not sufficiently sophisticated to enable deductions to be made.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and put in place a system to deal with the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Each year rent supplement is paid in respect of over 900 tenancies where the landlord is living outside the State.  The total value of such payments is of the order of €4 million or approximately 1% of total expenditure on rent supplement.  Payment is made directly to some 130 of these landlords domiciled outside of the State in respect of approximately 150 such tenancies.  The value of these payments is approximately €950,000, which represents at most 0.25% of all rent supplement payments.  There is a general obligation on individuals and bodies making payments in respect of rent to landlords domiciled outside the State to deduct withholding tax from such payments and remit the proceeds to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where rent supplement is in payment direct to the tenant, that obligation lies with the tenant but rests with the HSE, on behalf of my Department, in the 150 tenancies where payment is made direct to landlords domiciled outside the State.  Withholding tax is not deducted at present by the HSE or the Department.My Department has given details of the 150 landlords living outside the State to the Revenue Commissioners where rent payments were made direct to them in 2006.  This information should facilitate the Revenue Commissioners in pursuing relevant inquiries as to the tax compliance position of the landlords in question.  Details for 2007 will be provided to the Revenue Commissioners in due course as part of the Department's annual provision of information to the Revenue Commissioners.Discussions are continuing with the Revenue Commissioners on the need for my Department to put information technology systems in place to apply withholding tax in such a small number of cases and to consider alternative suitable arrangements for applying this tax.

We are talking about approximately €1 million.  As the system tightens up, there is every likelihood that the number of non-resident landlords will increase.  It is indefensible for the Minister to say his Department is making transfers of €1 million but that there is no system in place to ensure tax is paid on it or that the system in place puts the onus on the tenant.  Even if the numbers are small, there should still be a system in place to withhold tax due.  This amendment would provide for that, so there is no reason not to support it.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on extending the number of hours a week a Carer may be gainfully employed while still retaining entitlement to Carer's Allowance/Benefit.Both of these amendments relate to carers.  We know from the recent census that 161,000 people provide care to elderly people or people with a disability and yet only one in five is in receipt of a carer's payment.  Some 67,000 carers spend more than 15 hours per week caring while 50,000 spend more than 29 hours per week caring and yet only 35,000 get a weekly payment.  The combination of the means test and the working hours rule is precluding many carers from receiving any kind of payment.  It is a catch-22 situation for many people who provide care to a loved one but who must hold down a job to survive.The point I made on Committee Stage was that rather than have an arbitrary figure of 15 hours per week in terms of the hours worked a much more satisfactory test would be to ask whether the care provided to an elderly or a disabled person enables him or her to stay out of a nursing home or institutional care.  Surely that should be the test applied.  There are many situations where a person providing an hour's care in the morning and in the evening and at critical times enables a person to stay at home.One must take into consideration the inadequacy of the home help service in the community and the cutbacks in the number of hours.  I accept more funding has been provided and that home helps are on a better rate, which they should be, but very often that means the overall number of hours available is reduced in many communities.  It is sometimes very hard for people providing care to keep the show on the road and to enable the person being cared for to remain in his or her home with the proper care, in some kind of comfort and stay out of a nursing and to be able to pay the bills.I would like to see some flexibility.  The rules, as they apply at present, are too severe.  The fact that only 21% of carers are in receipt of a payment would testify to that fact.  That is the reason I tabled these two amendments.

There is room for flexibility and we should be a bit more imaginative in terms of the practicalities.  If a carer's workplace is close to the home of the person being cared for, an employer might be willing to give him or her permission to leave in an emergency so as to ensure the needs of the care recipient are met.  We should examine such issues in order to give people a real chance.We should not forget the loneliness and isolation for carers, particularly if they are caring for somebody who is quite ill and who may not be able to communicate.  Working, therefore, could be very important to them, both mentally and socially.  The 15 hour rule is quite restrictive and is less than what is allowed under some other social welfare schemes.  In those circumstances, this should be examined.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who provide certain older people or people with a disability with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.  The carer's allowance means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of spouses' earnings.  In budget 2008, I made provision to increase the income disregard in the carer's allowance means test to €332.50 for a single person and €665 per week for a couple from April 2008.One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the person is providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purpose of the schemes was increased from ten to 15 hours per week in June 2006.  It is worth noting that the 15 hour rule represents a relaxation of the full-time care and attention requirement.  A further increase in the number of hours a person can work and still qualify for payment would dilute the full-time care and attention requirement.In 2005, the carer's allowance scheme was extended to accommodate care sharing situations and under these arrangements, it is possible for a week on, week off care sharing arrangement to be facilitated.  This means that where two carers provide care to the same person on alternative weeks, the carer's allowance and the annual respite care grant can be split between them.In addition, budget 2007 provided for fundamental reform of payments to carers whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer's allowance or benefit who are providing full-time care and attention can retain their main payment and receive another payment depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance.As I said, the Government is committed to continuing to develop payment for carers and this commitment includes recognition of the fact there is a need for payment to carers to be flexible where possible.  I will keep the supports for carers available from the Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments in regard to income support are delivered.

The efforts of such carers are worthy of recognition.The Carers Association will attest to the fact that isolation is an extremely important issue for those who provide care.  There are many good reasons, apart entirely from their ability to pay their bills, for people to remain in the workforce.  These include maintaining social contact or keeping a farm or family business in operation.  Certain individuals are making a significant contribution in the context of providing care for others to enable them to remain at home.  That is the critical point.  For that reason, there is a need for far greater flexibility in the operation of the scheme.

The Government has come a hell of a long way in recent years in the context of the supports provided for carers.  The scheme has become much more flexible, it accommodates many more people and the income disregards relating to it are excellent.  I will try to do more, as each budget approaches, to try to enhance the scheme in order to ensure more people benefit from it.  There is, however, a fundamental difference between a scheme that is designed to support people on low incomes who are providing care and — this is ultimately what the Deputy wants to see happen — paying people to provide care.  The latter would be a major step and would require careful consideration.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on removing Carer's Allowance from the list of welfare payments requiring the Habitual Residence Condition to be met.This amendment relates to the habitual residency condition and its application to carer's allowance.  We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage.  The aim of the amendment is to remove the habitual residence condition as it relates to carer's allowance.  Statistics indicate a low risk of abuse in respect of this payment.  Between mid-2004 and mid-2006, only 114 people were refused carer's allowance.  Of these, 36 were Irish.There are other tests relating to the payment, for example, the requirement that a carer must be in a position to provide full-time care and attention, which protect it from abuse.  It would be appropriate to require that the person being cared for must be resident here for a certain period.  As matters stand, carers who move here from abroad in order to look after a relative are unsure of their income support status.  The Minister would not be opening the floodgates if the HRC rule was removed from the carer's allowance.On Committee Stage, we discussed the phenomenon of Irish people who live abroad, for example, in the US or the UK, who want to return home for a few months or a couple of years in order to care for elderly relatives but who do not want to move here permanently.  We should facilitate people who wish to return home to provide care.By suggesting the habitual residence condition be removed in respect of carer's allowance, I am not stating it should be made available only to Irish people.  The allowance should be made available to anybody who makes a claim.  However, the Minister could provide a safeguard in respect of it by requiring that a person who requires care should be resident in the State for a particular period.  I do not believe anyone in the House would disagree with a system whereby people returning home to care, for example, for an elderly mother, should be denied payment.

The point has been made that there is a difficulty with regard to people returning home to care for family members because the habitual residence condition affects their entitlement to carer's allowance.Anecdotal information relating to this matter was provided on Committee Stage.  In addition, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, highlighted a number of serious cases.  I will comment on the habitual residence condition in respect of a later amendment.  Difficulties arise in the context of the operation of this condition and it presents a harsh reality for particular sections of the population.  I do not have a difficulty with the concept of it as an overarching condition.  However, its specific application can have serious effects on individual sections of society.  In my opinion, the condition requires review.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	333	On the final point made by Deputy Shortall, people are not precluded from payment.  All applicants, regardless of nationality, are required to be habitually resident in the State to qualify for carer's allowance.  The question of what constitutes a person's habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the criteria to be applied in determining whether a person is habitually resident.  Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right.  Decisions are based on the application of the guidelines to the individual circumstances of each case.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal.Payments have nothing to do with the person who requires care.  They are made to the person providing the care.  I accept the point the Deputy is making but what she is seeking would require a fundamental shift in the scheme.I requested information on this matter following the debate on Committee Stage.  I was presented with notes relating to 22 cases.  I thought I had them in my possession but unfortunately that is not the case.  I have requested one of my officials to obtain them.  The notes to which I refer make for interesting reading.  There is no phenomenon or mystery in this area.  From the cases I reviewed, the reasons for refusing payment to people are clear.  In nearly all cases, people accept the decisions made.  Individuals try to obtain assistance through the system but they understand that if they do not qualify, payment cannot be made.  It is easy for someone returning to Ireland following a few years abroad to reassert their connection to the State.  There is no issue in that regard.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I do not have personal experience of this matter.  However, agencies that work in the area have contacted us and claim that some cases exist.  The suggestion I made whereby a stipulation would be put in place in respect of the person being cared for is not new.  There are, after all, two existing stipulations regarding the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  The first of these relates to his or her disability and the second to his or her place of residence.  I do not see the difficulty in extending the provisions.Removing the habitual residence condition in respect of carer's allowance would not pose a major risk.  The figures relating to this matter are quite small.  In light of current circumstances, our historical background and the phenomenon of people returning home for short periods to provide care, the Minister should at least put in place a pilot scheme for a three-year period to identify abuses that might occur.  There is no evidence of abuse or attempted abuse and the numbers are small.  The amendment would deal with those few who seem to be hard done by.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I will give Deputies a flavour of these cases without mentioning names.  A widow returned from the United Kingdom in 2005, having lived there since 1960, and applied for carer's allowance in October that year in respect of her two sons.  She was asked to clarify details of her residency in the United Kingdom but no response was received.  Her claim was refused on the grounds that she had failed to furnish such evidence and that was the end of the matter, as the Department never heard from her again.  A married man returned from the United Kingdom during July and August 2005 to care for his sister.  When he returned again to look after her in September that year, he applied for the allowance.  She passed away in October and he returned to the United Kingdom in December.  A single girl returned from the USA in November 2005 after five years to look after her mother.  She applied for carer's allowance that December.  When her application was being considered, she was asked to provide evidence that she had returned to Ireland permanently.  She responded by withdrawing her application.  That is par for the course.I have a list of similar cases.  There is no major issue.  None of the people involved in these cases is coming back for one or two years.  If they do, they establish residency by opening bank accounts and making it clear that they are going to live here.  The cases I have cited are the types refused.  The people in question do not give us information about their residency.  It becomes impossible for the system to deal with such persons.

The agencies working in the area, Crosscare and FLAC, have approached all of us with examples of cases in which Irish people seem to have been hard done by through the operation of the habitual residency condition.  The Minister should see how it goes with carer's allowance by removing the condition because the numbers are small.  On the basis of the cases presented to us, there is a strong case to be made for removing the condition in respect of that payment.

It is often a sore point with persons in receipt of long-term illness benefits.  They have been making payments and doing their best until, through no fault of their own, they are out of work and for some unknown reason are not paid for the first three days of a claim.  Nobody is suggesting somebody who is out sick for two or three days should be paid but it seems only fair that if a person is out for two or three weeks, he or she should be able to recoup the payment for those three days in the second or third week.  I do not understand the reason for omitting a payment for the first three days if a person is entitled to make a claim.  I ask for it to be reinstated.

I will be interested to hear the Minister's logic.  He discussed the issue on Committee Stage but I was not convinced by his argument.  It is penal to leave the initial three days out of the payment.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Waiting days have been a feature of the illness benefit and jobseeker's payment schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.  The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims of short duration.  The waiting day rule is not applied in every case.  Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of interruption of employment, it would clearly be unreasonable to impose the three-day waiting rule for each benefit claim.In the case of illness and jobseeker's benefits spells of interruption of employment are aggregated in order that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period subject to the rules of linking.  These rules provide that any two periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one claim and payment may be made from the first day of the latter claim.  The linking period for jobseeker's allowance is 52 weeks instead of 26.  Linking rules apply in a variety of ways across schemes, for example, where a person claims illness benefit immediately following an unemployment benefit claim.  A person who has no other income is not left without support during waiting days; he or she may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.

It is a particularly swingeing measure to count other welfare payments as means.  This arises particularly in respect of back to school allowance.  It is miserable and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	346	All social assistance payments are subject to a means test.  This is a way of checking whether a person has enough means to support himself or herself and deciding the level of payment, if any, for which a person may qualify.  Means are any income belonging to a claimant, or his or her partner.  This includes property, except a family home or an asset that can provide a person with an income.  There are similarities in the specific tests applied under each category of benefit.  Household composition and means test rules, however, including exclusive disregards for each specific scheme, are designed to meet the objectives of each category of benefit and to ensure the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need.  Different means tests apply to people in different houses with different incomes and must be considered separately.  It is not possible to have a one-size-fits-all scheme because the schemes are so focused and specific to each household and each individual within that household.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on providing that current welfare and pension recipients who are paid by payment book method shall retain that method of payment until they opt of their own volition for another method.These amendments concern the Department's changeover from book to swipe or social welfare card payments.  None of us would object to this change but social welfare recipients and staff working in post offices have raised several concerns associated with the new way of making payment.  The first is what is a person to do who is not in a position to collect his or her payment?  At present he or she can sign the back of the book and authorise somebody to collect the payment on his or her behalf.  It is not clear what happens with the swipe card.  Is it just a matter of handing over the swipe card to somebody?  How does one guard against fraud, a family member for instance taking the swipe card to the post office and obtaining a payment on behalf of the person who should be getting it?  There is some concern about that and as regards how the new system will operate.Another impact from the changeover is the question of the validity period for payments.  Currently most social welfare dockets are valid for three months, but this is to be reduced to 20 days under the proposed change, I understand.  Again, this has implications for the manner in which people manage their money and budget, particularly as regards child benefit.  Very often people allow that to build up in anticipation of expensive periods in the course of the year, when children go back to school in September or whatever.  Sometimes social welfare payments are allowed to build up so there is sufficient money to pay for central heating oil, coal deliveries and so on.  People have their own ways of managing their social welfare income which will be affected by these changes.  It is very hard to understand why there should be change, in particular, as regards the validity period in which a payment applies.  I would appreciate if the Minister addressed those two issues.

I am concerned, however, as regards the teething problems, particularly in respect of elderly social welfare recipients, who at present can sign cheques authorising nominees to collect payments on their behalf.  They exercise control in so far as their signature is on the back of the cheque being presented at the local post office.  I am open to correction as regards my interpretation of the Secretary General's comments in this regard, but I understand her to say a social welfare customer may sign a long-term nomination form and also a short-term form for when he or she is sick, in hospital for a few weeks or whatever.  I am not clear how that will work as regards the short-term nominee.  The potential for abuse exists within the new system because there is no clarity as regards the dates to be on the forms.  Will they be pre-printed when someone is signing for a week, month or whatever?  It appears to do away with the degree of control the recipient has under the current system, and this needs to be addressed.I raised the matter of the validity period on Committee Stage, and Deputy Shortall has raised it again.  Somebody in hospital for a hip operation could be out of action for a two-month period, by which time his or her payment will be out of date.  Not every social welfare recipient will want to sign a nomination form.  Some will prefer to let the payments build up so they may collect them from the post office.  Perhaps the Minister will also deal with that point.The matter of budgeting has been raised with us.  I know one can argue that if social welfare is so badly needed it is unlikely to be let build up over a number of weeks.  There is some validity in this, but at the same time, some people allow it to build up as a means of paying for big occasions such as first communions or fuel deliveries.  We have discussed the fuel strategy before and I asked the Minister to consider whether the payment in this regard might be paid in a bigger lump sum than at present.  These changes, however, appear to eliminate recipients' opportunities for budgeting, short of opening credit union or post office accounts for themselves.  The Minister looks as if he disagrees, but the information I have been getting——

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I have taken the opportunity, in dealing with this, to go to some post offices, unannounced, to talk to customers.  In fairness they seemed happy enough, although a few issues, here and there, were raised.  One of the points made to me was that sometimes those who pronounce on such matters believe that once people reach 65 they become stupid and are not able to manage these things at all. Incidentally, I am not referring to Deputies Shortall and Enright in this regard, or indeed myself, in the context of debating these matters.  These people got quite irate and emphasised they were as good as any 21 year old.  Sometimes changes presented problems, they conceded, but they asked me to ensure they were not being patronised all the time.I expressed the hope that I did not do that.  However, they insisted there was a tendency in officialdom to treat older recipients as "fuddy duddy" and not able, but the point was made forcefully to me that this was not the case.  They wanted to assure Members of the Oireachtas that they were more than capable of dealing in the modern world.The Department is implementing a three-way strategy to change paper based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices and financial institutions.  The programme is being implemented on a phased basis to coincide with new book renewal production schedules and as personalised payable order books expire.  All new claims opened since September 2007 are paid by electronic means, either at a financial institution or post office and as far as I am aware there have been no complaints from customers.  The replacement of books with swipe cards will have no impact on customers paid at post offices.  Customers will simply present their social services card and sign for their payment in the normal way.  An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union are committed in assisting customers in the use of cards for collecting their payments.For those customers who cannot collect their payments in person, the Department is putting arrangements in place to allow nominated persons to collect, using a social services card.  For example, a customer who requires temporary aid and facility can nominate a person on the day to collect his or her payment at the post office.  Such a person will sign a form at the post office.  In terms of arrangements where a customer being paid using a social services card requires an agent for a specified period, the Department can be contacted and a letter authorising such a person will be issued.  The agent can use a swipe card to collect the payment on behalf of the customer for a specified period of time.  Long-term, the Department is working closely with An Post to ensure a permanent solution is put in place as soon as possible to allow a nominated person to collect a payment on behalf of a customer using a social services card.Changes to the An Post counter system are underway to facilitate and record collection by an agent using the social services card.  Under the long-term arrangements, an electronic information transfer, EIT, containing the name and address of the agent will be sent to the relevant post office.  The post office can verify from this information that the person collecting the payment is the authorised agent.  It is hoped the long-term agent facility arrangements will be finalised this year.A range of measures is underway to inform customers of the change in payment methods and allay fears and concerns they may have regarding the use of social services cards to collect their payments at post offices.  Each customer is being informed by letter of the change in his or her payment arrangement.  A letter is being sent to each person who is being changed from book to social services card, informing him or her of the change and how to use the card.  A social services card is sent to his or her post office.We have just heard this again from both Deputies, but on Committee Stage Deputies Shortall and Enright raised concerns that under the EIT payment method, customers would have to collect their payments within 20 days compared to the three months allowed to cash their PPOs.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that pensioners will have 60 days to collect their EIT payments.  Where customers are paid by EIT, they will get the benefit of any increases immediately, of course, on the electronic system.  Incidentally, if they are outside the 60 days they can reapply and the money will be paid to them anyway.  Therefore there is no loss at all.I am confident these arrangements will work and they will be continuously monitored for the benefit of our customers.

That is not the case — it is 60 days.  Even if it falls outside that time limit, a customer may reapply and the money will be paid to him or her anyway.

I have not been specific in my answer, apart from saying that it is so for pensions.  However, there seems to be a question that it might not be 20 days either for children's allowance, but I shall check that.

I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  At present one can wait up to six months.  That seems reasonable because of the nature of the payment and the way in which recipients save it.  The system, as it stands, causes a lot of paperwork for the Department and inconvenience for the customer.  I will withdraw my amendment on the grounds that the Minister will consider the matter.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need for foster parents to be considered a qualified parent and for fostered children to be considered a qualified child for the purposes of qualifying for the one parent family payment.This amendment arises from a particular case involving a common law couple who had been together for 28 years and fostered two very young children.  Tragically, the woman concerned died, leaving her partner to care for the two young children on his own with the assistance of a foster payment for each child.  The tragic circumstances were such that he had to resign from his job to provide full-time care for the two children.  On Committee Stage, the Minister implied that the man in question had been refused the one-parent family payment because he was in receipt of foster allowance.  However, the latter allowance is to meet the needs of the children.  This is the official position of the Department.  The payment is particularly to meet the additional expenses related to foster children, including making arrangements for them to meet their natural parents and keep in contact with their families.In the case in question the man was not regarded as a qualified parent because he was not the parent of a qualified child.  Under existing legislation, the definition of "parent" does not include a foster parent.  There is a need to change the wording as a consequence.  I stated previously that if the man had a child of his own, he would be entitled to claim the one-parent family payment.  If he were a separated spouse or widow, the requirement to have a child of his own would not be a requirement under the legislation.  His case is very unusual but it seems extraordinary that he would be denied the one-parent family payment given his very tragic circumstances.There is no problem or should be no problem with the principle of my amendment.  I ask the Minister to recognise that there is a difficulty with the wording of the legislation, which wording did not encapsulate the circumstances I describe.  The officers dealing with the case recognise this problem with the wording and believe there is no question but that a person in such circumstances should be entitled to a one-parent family payment.  I ask the Minister to consider the case compassionately.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	362	We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  The Deputy presents the case as if the individuals concerned were disadvantaged.  I would not say they are because they receive the foster payment, which can be €319 per week for each child under 12 years and €346 per week for every child over the age of 12.  One cannot receive both payments.  The case outlined by the Deputy highlights an anomaly in the legislation and I intend to deal with it at the next available opportunity.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I appreciate that but it will not help people in the circumstances I have described.  The Minister has stated one cannot receive two payments.  If the man in question had a child of his own, he would receive another payment.  Foster allowance is not a payment for the adult providing foster care but a payment to meet the expenses that result from fostering a child.  The man to whom I referred must give up his job and, therefore, has no income of his own.  It strikes me that he should be entitled to receive the one-parent family payment as a consequence but he is being denied it because of the way the legislation is worded.  As I stated, none of the Minister's officers would say he should be denied it.  They recognise that a very definite anomaly needs to be dealt with by changing the legislation.  Regardless of the Minister's intentions in this regard, it will be a long time before he has an opportunity to change the legislation.  I, therefore, urge him to accept my amendment.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:3.—The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the prospect of removing the Habitual Residence Condition from the Child Benefit payment.I will be very brief because we have discussed this issue in some detail.  I want to reiterate one point.  Having read the Minister's comments thereon, I want to prevent him from being flabbergasted again.  Child benefit is paid to every child and does not confer an automatic right to other payments.  There is no suggestion, therefore, that the floodgates would be opened.  I asked the Minister whether he could forward to me copies of the judgments of the European Court of Justice, on which he was relying.  I will be happy to read them and, having done so, will stand corrected, if necessary.I still maintain that there is a genuine case.  I am only approaching the matter from the perspective of determining what is best for the child, as outlined by a vast number of groups dealing with the issue of child poverty.  I appreciate the Minister's point that he cannot make a change in respect of one case without it having an impact on all other circumstances associated with the habitual residency condition, but I ask him to reconsider this one.  The existing provision causes difficulty for children.Some families are in asylum centres for seven years, only one year short of a pupil's time in primary school.  The average number of children of these families is 2.4.  Therefore, it is a question of making a payment to the families concerned of approximately €70 per week.  The payment is such that there would not be a deluge on the shores of Ireland.  As I stated, child benefit does not confer a right to additional payments.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider his position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The Deputy said she would be brief and I will be equally so.  We have had long debates on this issue.  I will simply not grant an entitlement to child benefit to those who are not habitually resident in the country.  It would be extraordinary to do so and I could not countenance it.  As the Deputy rightly stated, I made the point that one could not deal with child benefit in isolation.  The habitual residency clause applies.  I will forward the Deputy the judgments made in this regard, which she can peruse for her own benefit.  I simply could not accept the amendment.

In page 6, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:5.—The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Family Income Supplement.I will be brief because I know a review is being carried out.  When will it be available to us?  Its purpose is to establish the reason people have not made claims, despite the Department's work in this area in 2005 and 2006.  I ask the Minister to be open to making changes, if necessary, following the review or to have another campaign to ensure that those who are eligible for the family income supplement are able to avail of it.I reiterate the point I made on Committee Stage about my concern, following the budget, for part-time workers.  While the amount they have lost might be small, it is still a net loss rather than a gain following the changes made.  I am aware there is a review due and it might be a little early to speak of it.

As Deputy Enright stated, there is a review and we will wait for the results of it.There has been a substantial increase, from a static position, in recent times.  The FIS is a good payment.  It emphasises people working and those are the type of payments I think are important in terms of the poverty trap.  I cannot accept the amendment.  If the Deputy is agreeable, we will wait and see what the review shows up.

In page 6, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:5.—The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, among low income families.I made two points.  First, the Minister stated in response to me on Committee Stage that he would examine the possibility of making this payment more automatic or would see if it is in any way practical to do that and save the existing application process.  The second point relates to the amount given to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  The overall cost on a parent whose child is going back to school is quite significant and, indeed, it does not end in September.The cost of education has risen over the past number of years, especially with so-called voluntary contributions which now arise.  I am not necessarily asking the Minister to fund a system that the Department of Education and Science should be funding, but the reality according to recent reports in the media is that there are families who are put in the position where they are unable to make payments, which other children's parents are in a position to make, that are being imposed by the school.  Perhaps that is a matter in the context of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance that the Minister might discuss with his colleague in the Department of Education and Science.  Aside from that, there are significant costs such as transport, stationary and lunches.  I ask the Minister — it cannot happen in the context of this Bill — in the context of next year to give particular attention to this area.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	As I stated to Deputy Enright on Committee Stage, there are 180,000 children in over 88,000 households benefiting from this.  The scheme involves a not insignificant amount of money.  We have provided over €43 million for the scheme in 2008, but particularly in budget 2007 we increased the rates from the base of €180 for children between the ages of two and 11 to €200 and for those between the ages of 12 to 22 to €305.  That involved an increase of 67% and 61%, respectively, over the two years.  That recognises the benefit of the scheme.  It must be balanced in the context of all schemes.  The figures are not insignificant in terms of the contribution.  It can make a very significant difference to the families involved.

It is the scale of the difference it makes in light of the cost of education that is the point.  The cost of everything has risen, be it school books or clothing.  The entire cost of the return to school has risen.  From that perspective, I reiterate that I ask the Minister to look at it.

The only point I want to make in terms of illness benefit, and the disability payment, is the time taken for appeals, particularly in the case of disability payment.  While we get answers to parliamentary questions, Deputy O'Dowd raised with me today the fact that while it takes 22 weeks for an appeal, he cited three separate instances of persons attending his clinic at the weekend who are waiting over a year, including the appeal time period, for the payment.  The timescale needs to be addressed for the future.

The reason I retabled this amendment is to ensure we see action in this area.  There are several issues, cohabitation probably being one of the main ones.  Equally important is the ability of people to work.  The Minister published discussions or flew a kite — whatever way he would like to put it.

We are on the same issues and the difficulty is we have no proposals.I support the idea of people being facilitated to get back into the workforce and to get back into education and training.  Of course that is important.  I was concerned with the mandatory nature of I do not know what because it was discussion rather than a concrete proposal.  The practicalities, particularly in some areas from a perspective of child care and transportation, of anything that would be mandatory is not a matter we will be able to tease out today but it is important that concrete proposals are put before us as soon as possible so this matter can be progressed.  The cohabitation issue, in particular, is anti-family, is not reflective of the reality of life today and is causing significant difficulties for people.  I have an open mind but I want to see definite proposals on which we can move forward.I will press the amendment because it is important to highlight how crucial it is that we get to grips and deal with this.

I ask the Minister to put on the record his commitment for replacing the one-parent family payment with the parental allowance payment, which would be neutral as regards there being one or two parents in the family and neutral also as regards whether they were in or out of employment.

In page 8, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:9.—The Minister shall, within one month of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress of the National Carers Strategy.On amendment No. 24, I was disappointed the national carers' strategy was not published, as per the original commitment, by the end of 2007.  There is little we can do about that now.  I want to ensure it proceeds apace and that we have a strategy put before us without undue delay.  I want the Minister to confirm to the House that everything is on the table in that regard and that there are no preclusions on any issue that any group wants to bring to the table in discussions in this regard.On Committee Stage we debated briefly the issue of young carers.  The Minister mentioned this issue has been transferred to the Department of Health and Children.  He referred me to the Caring Before Their Time document published by Barnardos, which I looked at since we dealt with the matter last week.  The point made in that document is that we do not want to look at young carers in isolation because they are caring as part of a family network or situation.  In that sense, it is important the national carers' strategy, regardless of whether the Department of Health and Children will take the lead in the area, discusses and deals with the issue of young carers and recognises their role.  The Barnardos document points out there is no national policy dedicated to young carers.There is also a dearth of research in the area of young carers.  While the Barnardos document is useful, it points out that there was no reliable research available to it, which is a difficulty.  It stresses that a family approach is required and because of that, it would be wrong to exclude the issue of young carers from the national carers' strategy.  I have no difficulty with the Department of Health and Children being the lead Department on this.  I already mentioned the importance of involving the Department of Education and Science because young carers can miss out on educational opportunities by being in that position.  It is very important the strategy includes the young carers issue.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The working group has been established under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.  All the different agencies and stakeholders are involved in the process and it is intended to publish the strategy later this year.  That is important work and was well rehearsed in Towards 2016 and in the social partnership arena.On amendment No. 25, the issue of dealing with young carers is a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for children within the Department of Health and Children.  It has not been transferred but remains there, which is appropriate.  The 2004 report from the children's research centre recommended there be further research in this area.  More quality research is required and that is being undertaken by the Department of Health and Children and will look at this important area.  We need to fully understand all the facts involved.

It is unfortunate that the Minister did not accept even one amendment, despite acknowledging the point of a number of them on Committee Stage.  From the point of view of parliamentary business, retaining an interest and working on legislation, it is disappointing when there is a blanket refusal to accept any amendments.  Legislation is the worse for it.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	403	In fairness, I have.  There are a number of stakeholders involved in the social and family affairs area.  The delivery of policy in the social economy area approaches a budget of some €17 billion.  We forget, as a result of the transformation over the past ten or 15 years, that less than 9% of that budget now deals directly with unemployment.  The significant policy area that has emerged and the resources that have been put into place to deal with it are formidable and substantial.  That does not mean the sort of policies that have evolved over the past few years are perfect or that they cannot be enhanced or improved upon — they can.Picking up on Deputy Shortall's and Deputy Enright's comments during the course of the debate, one can see the co-relation between many of the policies' impacts on people's ability to move smoothly from being assisted within the social welfare system into either full or part-time employment and that is the real challenge.  This is ongoing and we need to effect the same changes with regard to lone parents.I accept the point made by Deputy Enright.  When we use the word "mandatory", it is not that we are threatening people in terms of bringing them into the system.  We all agree that people who are dependent on the social welfare system should interact with the system and should not be unknown to it or not understand it themselves.  They should be able to deal with and interact with it on a constant basis.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The position in Kilkenny and Coolock where the two studies are under way is very interesting.  Those lone parents who have come in to meet staff and officials have found it extremely beneficial and have encouraged some of their friends and colleagues that this is a non-threatening approach to dealing with their individual needs.  We all understand it is not just about financial payments, but about the child care and serious educational needs of these people.  Unfortunately, many lone parents left school at a very young age and did not have the necessary education levels required.  We need to assist them with their education and assist them back into the workplace.What the Deputies have said has been a valuable contribution and we will see the fruits of this in the future.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Last Saturday week at 6.30 p.m. one of the most gruesome murders in living memory took place when two innocent men were brutally murdered on the street in Drimnagh just yards from their home.  These people were law-abiding, hard-working residents of Drimnagh who were minding their own business when they were brutally attacked.  On behalf of Fine Gael, I offer my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Pawel Kalite and Mariusz Szwajkos.  They remain in our thoughts at this tragic time.Some may argue that the manner in which Pawel and Mariusz lost their lives constituted an isolated incident.  However, I believe their deaths must be considered in the broader context of a sharp rise in knife crime and assaults in recent times.  The figures speak for themselves.  In 2007, stabbings accounted for almost one half of homicides.  Moreover, between 1999 and 2006, the number of assaults causing harm increased more than five-fold from 737 to 3,971.  Last year, serious crime rose again with significant increases in gun crime, drug offences, murder and threats of murder.  There were 84 murders and manslaughters, including 26 stabbings and 28 gun murders — the highest number of murders in the State since the civil war.We cannot bury our heads in the sand and hope that such an illogical and malicious attack will not happen again.  As a Parliament, we must ensure that steps are taken to bring an end to the rising tide of stabbings, assaults, mindless violence and intimidation.  Following last week's murders, many people reflected upon the inter-related and growing trends of anti-social behaviour and the abuse of drugs and alcohol that have crept into Irish society and become seemingly embedded therein.  These three social ills have risen in tandem — the two former arguably spawning the latter — and are most prevalent among our young people.  Crimes are being committed daily by yobs high on drugs and crazed with drink who have no respect for the law or for their fellow man.It sounds like a cliché to say that every city, town and village in the country is affected but that is the sad truth.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	410	We know that drug and alcohol abuse recognises no county borders and no distinction between urban and rural areas.  We know that anti-social behaviour affects almost every community, varying from boy racers tearing up and down residential roads late at night to menacing groups of young people hanging around street corners intimidating passers-by and law-abiding citizens.  It has been suggested that Pawel and Mariusz lost their lives after they refused to buy alcohol for a gang of teenagers.  It seems that in the view of our teenagers, a reasonable punishment for refusing to break the law to facilitate underage drinking was to be stabbed fatally with a sharpened screwdriver.  It is a source of great shame to us all that these two innocent men lost their lives so needlessly and so callously.  That is why we in the Opposition cannot allow the Government to simply pay lip service to the root causes of such mindless violence.Throwing money at the problem here and there without proper cross-departmental, inter-agency co-ordination is simply not working and will not work.  Building super prisons while all that existing prisons seem to do is turn out repeat offenders with worsened drug problems is not going to stem the rising tide of violence in our society.Fine Gael recognises both the seriousness of the threat posed by anti-social behaviour and the need for a more co-ordinated approach.  We believe there is a need for ring-fenced funding and for a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating and driving a campaign to tackle and root out anti-social behaviour.   We want the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tackle the root causes of anti-social behaviour by increasing the number of garda juvenile liaison officers, improving resources for the overstretched probation service which has seen its funding dwindle under successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments, commencing all sections of the Children's Act and setting up new sporting and leisure facilities, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds throughout the country.However, we also recognise the need for the State to be tough on those who insist on intimidating their communities and impairing people's quality of life.  To this end, we are demanding more robust measures including increased Garda powers to curb loitering and intimidation by groups, electronic tagging for repeat offenders, increased use of curfew orders, meaningful and real fines for illegal sale of alcohol, empowering gardaí to confiscate alcohol from those illegally drinking in public places and on-the-spot-fines for offences against public order.This multifaceted yet co-ordinated approach is in marked contrast to the present Government's half-hearted and disjointed efforts.  While the Criminal Justice Act 2006 explicitly recognised the prevalence of anti-social behaviour in this country by introducing anti-social behaviour orders not one single order was handed down by the courts in 2007.  The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was strong on rhetoric and prided himself on draconian legislative initiatives but the proof is in the pudding.  These initiatives have failed.  Up to 40% of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, which was heralded by the former Minister, Michael McDowell, and his Fianna Fáil colleagues before the election as the most draconian legislation since the Offences against the State Act, has still not been subjected to commencement orders.  In contrast to his predecessor, the present Minister prefers the laid-back position.There is a clear lack of coherence across Departments in their approach to anti-social behaviour.  A fortnight ago the HSE suddenly withdrew funding for a homeless centre, the purpose of which was to help tackle the problem of anti-social behaviour, including illegal drinking, on the Liffey boardwalk.  Similarly, given the scale of the problem, the dearth of youth cafés and juvenile liaison officers constitutes a less than wholehearted commitment by Government to stamping out anti-social behaviour.  Closed circuit television is considered very effective in reducing incidents of anti-social behaviour.  Last week, the Garda Commissioner informed me that it was a vital tool in the detection of crime yet we are still without an effective network of State-controlled CCTV cameras across our towns and cities in spite of repeated promises of a half-hearted nature.The lack of coherence in respect of the Government's policies on drug and alcohol abuse is staggering.  The gardaí are of the opinion that increased drug and alcohol abuse has fuelled violent crime and civic disorder.  We know that, as does every citizen in this State.  If availability fuels demand then the blame for increased availability of both drugs and alcohol must be laid at the door of the present Government.  We know that alcohol and drugs fuel anti-social behaviour, particularly violent brawls and civic disorder outside pubs and nightclubs.  Nonetheless, we have witnessed a virtual explosion in special exemption orders for late night drinking.  Today's edition of The Irish Times reports that gardaí in Letterkenny have sought to limit the terms of special exemption orders, holding them partially responsible for a plethora of civic order offences.  The newspaper reports that in 2007, there were over 1,000 public order incidents in the provincial town of Letterkenny, as well as 233 minor assaults.  A District Court judge in Donegal recognised the direct link between special exemption orders, late night drinking and civic disorder and has limited the opening hours of some nightclubs in Letterkenny as a consequence.  I wonder when the penny will drop for the Government on this issue.In respect of off-licences and the availability of alcohol through these retail outlets, 637 new off-licences were permitted to open last year, in addition to the 547 opened in 2006.  Yet only 96 prosecutions have been taken in a five-year period against off-licences, shops, pubs and restaurants for illegally supplying alcohol to under 18s and of these, only 14 were brought in 2007.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	There is an obvious and urgent need to restrict the availability of alcohol and to tackle underage drinking in particular.  We are now waiting for yet more recommendations from more reports from more consultative bodies while previous expert reports remain unimplemented at the hands of the present Government.In respect of the availability of drugs in this country, the Government's record is nothing short of disgraceful.  An excellent "Prime Time Investigates" documentary found traces of cocaine in over 90% of clubs, pubs and workplaces it surveyed throughout the country.  While the gardaí and customs officers have worked exceptionally hard to intercept drugs before they make their way onto our streets, they are being seriously hampered in their work by the State's intransigent refusal to fund properly customs and excise operations.  We have one lone patrol vessel to monitor 4,300 km of coastline.  At our ports, we have the absolutely farcical situation where our sole X-ray scanner must move from port to port on a rotating basis to facilitate random checks.  Gardaí believe that well-organised crime gangs simply monitor movement of the scanner to avoid detection of drug shipments.  At our smaller airports, standards are shockingly lax, with the Government arguing it is simply not cost-efficient to put proper customs facilities in place there.If the Customs and Excise Service could make 2,700 drugs seizures valued at €139 million in 2007 with the help of a few sniffer dogs, one X-ray machine and one boat, what could it achieve if it was properly resourced?  The Minister for Finance has recently committed to one extra boat and one extra scanner to be introduced during the next four years.  Why does the Government refuse to sanction adequate facilities?  Why must it always be the half-hearted, half-measure rather than a decisive, appropriate, courageous solution?  Two scanners cannot cover every port and two boats cannot patrol an entire coastline.  If the Minister is serious about stemming the flow of drugs into this country, the Government needs to invest at the coalface, in our ports and airports, in a serious endeavour to cut supply.Tonight I am calling for a number of specific measures to address the rise in the number of offensive weapons, especially knifes, and in anti-social behaviour.  Fine Gael believes that the Government must complete, as a matter of urgency, a comprehensive review of the availability of knives and offensive weapons.  While the Minister may argue that the legislation is robust, the reality is that it is still possible to walk into a shop, purchase a samurai sword over the counter for €50 and an array of other deadly weapons.  This easy availability facilitated a brutal attack in Finglas in January when a man's hand was sliced off in a public house in full view of all the other customers.  At that time Fine Gael, for the second time, requested a legislative amendment to ban the sale, possession or importation of such swords but the Minister did not want to know.  We may have a long list of prohibited weapons in the 1991 legislation but is the Minister confident that this legislation is being robustly enforced?  Can he honestly say that the Garda Síochána is sufficiently resourced to enforce existing legislative provisions?Second, Fine Gael believes it is imperative that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, takes steps to bring about a significant increase in the number of community gardaí.  The experts agree that community policing must be the cornerstone of Irish policing.  More important, community policing is what the people want.  All of us in this House are aware from listening to the views of our constituents that community policing not only makes neighbourhoods safer places, but serves an important psychological function of making neighbourhoods feel safer for their residents.Fine Gael has produced a comprehensive policy on community policing and suggests a number of ways in which it can be made a reality.  These include the introduction of a special grade of community garda to make community policing an attractive career option, unlike what the Minister said today, "Ah, well, all gardaí are community gardaí".  This is not so.  Fine Gael wants the provision of longer-term assignments for community gardaí to allow them to really get to know the community.  This would allow them live in the community and mingle, work and network in the community.  Fine Gael wants the introduction of incentives to encourage gardaí to live in the community they serve and the involvement of the community in policing through community councils and fora.Community gardaí are absolutely essential to stemming the tide of anti-social behaviour.  If we want safe communities and safer streets, we must embed gardaí within them.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to use his influence with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to embrace community policing and take concrete steps to make it a reality.More urgently, however, Fine Gael is calling on the Government to mount a targeted six-month operation to take knives out of communities.  Experience has shown that the most effective Garda operations have been well-resourced strategic programmes with specific goals.As this House is aware, Operation Anvil was set up to target gangs in Dublin and selected areas around the State.  In its first 18 months, Operation Anvil resulted in the seizure of 573 firearms, almost 5,000 arrests and the recovery of almost €15 million in property.  The Minister now speaks of incorporating a dimension on knives into Operation Anvil while, at the same time, there are reports that funding for that project is to be cut.  Meanwhile, the policing plan for 2008, which is welcomed by Fine Gael, includes provision for a publicity campaign directed against the carrying of knives.  This is simply not enough.  Information campaigns are not sufficient.  Those targeted by Operation Anvil are, in my view, not the same target group as those who carry knives.  They are not the same target group as those who murdered Pawel Kalite and Mariusz Szwajkos.  As I stated earlier, 2007 witnessed the highest number of murders in the State since its foundation.  It was a year in which the number of fatal stabbings and knife assaults rose exponentially, a year in which stabbings accounted for almost half of homicides.  It is not good enough to react to these developments by simply tagging knife crime onto the end of Operation Anvil's terms of reference.  We need a specific, targeted response, a separate special operation.Fine Gael is proposing a six-month operation that would involve dedicated officers, concentration on areas with high incidents of assault and serious anti-social behaviour, use of legislative provisions to stop and search and arrest and charge suspects and the introduction of additional mobile units for the specific use of this new operation.Across the water, the British Government has made a serious commitment to eradicating knife crime.  Police in the UK have been told to prosecute anyone caught with a knife.  Two years ago, a major campaign aimed at tackling knife crime was launched in the North.  This campaign included an amnesty period; new legislation to raise the legal age for purchasing a knife from 16 to 18; an information campaign; and a targeted stop and search and arrest and charge policy.Meanwhile, the best the Minister can come up with is an information campaign which has not even started and an addendum to Operation Anvil.  This is simply not good enough.  The primary function of any Government is to provide for the safety and security of its people.  The right to feel safe in one's home and one's community is a fundamental right of the citizen in a democracy.  These rights are not being vindicated by this Government.  The Minister has a duty to protect the citizens of this State against those who seek to intimidate, maim and kill.  It is time to get tough on weapons-wielding thugs.  Fine Gael has proposed three ways forward tonight.  I sincerely hope the Minister will abandon partisanship and take our recommendations on board.  He owes it to the people of Ireland to take decisive and courageous action and to take it now.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I welcome this motion as it serves to highlight a very serious problem which is devastating our communities, namely, the increase in anti-social behaviour and the need to bring forward measures to prevent further violent attacks in our communities.Law and order seems to be a thing of the past and we are seeing more and more incidences of young offenders taking the law into their own hands at the cost of innocent lives.  Anti-social behaviour is visible everywhere and often escalates into more serious crime, such as the brutal murder of two young Polish men in Drimnagh last week.Since the tragic events of last week, there has been an outpouring of solidarity with the families of the victims.  I have witnessed at first hand the overwhelming response from the local community, who feel angry and disgusted at the savagery of this attack.  This was not a racially motivated attack; it was a case of mindless violence and a total disregard for human life.  Following this unprovoked act of violence which has left two families and a community searching for answers, it is vital that we engage in positive action to try to prevent such horrific attacks happening again.It goes without saying that the youths who are responsible for this awful crime must be made accountable and brought to justice.  People who are capable of committing these hateful crimes must learn a respect for the law and a respect for human life.  What has become of our society that people young and old no longer feel safe as they walk down the street where they live?  Why is it that so many people close the door to what is happening on the street outside?  The answer is fear and anxiety.On my travels around my constituency, I frequently see groups of young people hanging around on corners and behaving in an intimidating manner, instilling fear in passers-by. It is unacceptable that in a time of greater prosperity in this country, the basic values of respect, responsibility and caring for others, seem to count for so little.  Of course, these youths represent a small minority but unfortunately theirs are the actions that all too often have a devastating effect across the community.  Sadly, violence on our streets is becoming the norm.  The use of dangerous weapons is increasing and resulting in even more serious and life-threatening attacks.  It is high time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform committed to tackling knife crime which is becoming so commonplace on our streets.The misuse of alcohol and drugs is clearly a factor in the marked increase in violence on the street.  Children as young as ten can now stop an adult on the street to get them to buy alcohol for them at the local off-licence.  Teenagers are experimenting with a huge variety of drugs from cannabis to heroin and cocaine.  Too often we see young people strung out on alcohol as they huddle together in groups in the evening.  This is a recipe for disaster and we need to tackle this problem head on before more innocent people lose their lives.Many of the young people who are considered at risk are born into family circumstances where their destiny has already been mapped out.  It is a known fact that from the first visit of the public health nurse, young children at risk can be identified, but if there is no intervention at this early stage, they can embark on a cycle of dysfunctional behaviour.  For many children intervention at pre-school and primary school can help to steer them in the right direction.  Young people need to learn the risks involved in dabbling in drink and drugs, and also need to be educated about their social and community responsibilities, including respect for others and above all for human life.  Individuals need to take responsibility for their actions but responsibility also lies with parents and family members.  Many children coming from dysfunctional families come from a background of anti-social behaviour.  However, I have five children ranging from 26 to 14 and frequently, no matter where they are going, I ask them where they are going and with whom, and what they are doing.  This is my responsibility as a parent and I take it very seriously.In recent years I have had the privilege of being part of a community policing forum.  My personal experience of it has allowed me to be in touch with the community and get involved with the gardaí on the ground.  It is great to see people knowing the community garda by his first name and the same is true for him.  It is great to see them walking into the local youth club and participating in activities with some of the children.  This is what is needed.  We do not need gardaí standing on street corners.  They need to be around and involved.  This is the only way local crime can be tackled in a community with young people.  However, the bottom line is that we do not have enough community gardaí and they are not visible.  In Dublin South-Central, we have six in Sundrive Road, six in Crumlin, six in Ballyfermot and three in Inchicore to service a population of 122,000 people.  In God's name how is that enough?Community support is very important in making the streets safer.  Members of the community must be the eyes and ears, like Neighbourhood Watch used to be and still is in many areas.  For this to happen we need people to be committed to being involved in their community and recognise that they have a major role to play.  Community supports and facilities are very important in tackling anti-social behaviour.  We must consider what young people want and how they prefer to spend their time.  We need to come away from what we have known in the past as the normal youth club setting, which some young people no longer wish to be part of.  We need to identify with them that we live in 2008.  We need to bring certain activities of their choice to them and to help them along.  We have a very positive choice to make in the future for young people.  Not every young child wants to be part of a football team, a GAA club or normal youth club activities.  They want certain venues to go and sit or hang out, as they say.  A venue such as the Base in Ballyfermot is an ideal place for young people to come together and support each other.It is important that we support the call by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin to hold a community summit where people from the community can address the problems of violence in our society.  We need participation from the ground up.  In order for this to work we also need support from the Government, and statutory bodies such as the HSE, as well as social workers, gardaí, our local GPs and the religious communities.  I wish to echo the words of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin at the vigil in Mourne Road last night when he said: "We cannot just leave community involvement to moments of tragedy alone."  I urge the Government to support the Fine Gael motion.  This is a time for action and not words.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and propose to approach it from a juvenile justice aspect.  Getting tough on crime and creating the political illusion that a Government is on top of the issue involves much more than building new prison facilities and increasing our prison population.  We have been treated in this House in recent years to a New York-style "zero tolerance" approach which was followed by the "Trust me because I know best" approach by Mr. McDowell and yet we still find ourselves debating the issue.I acknowledge the enacting of parts of the Children Act 2001 and the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service as huge steps forward in terms of juvenile justice.  I say to the Minister that it is time to break from the styles of the previous 11 years of Fianna Fáil-led Governments, characterised by commissioning reports, establishing taskforces, empty rhetoric and creating forums.  This motion is presented in terms that allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to set out clearly both in timeframe and action how the Government plans to tackle the serious anti-social behaviour, which culminated in the tragic death of two young Polish men in a Dublin neighbourhood in ten days ago.A majority of people in Ireland believe that offenders come out of prison worse than when they went in.  Inmates with drug problems probably have a better selection of drugs from within the prison system.  Young criminals learn from older counterparts and maintain the cycle of lawlessness on release.  Up to 77% of offenders in Mountjoy have spent time in St. Patrick's Institution for juvenile offenders.  It is commonplace for a juvenile offender to notch up 20 or 30 convictions.  I am aware of a recently reported case where a juvenile clocked up 64 convictions and all of these offences are committed before they even reach 18 years of age.  This is making a mockery of the juvenile justice system.  I believe the issue of restorative justice, in which the victim, offender and a facilitator meet and agree on a resolution is one on which we could make progress.  In order for it to work the rights of the victim need to be placed as close as possible to the fundamentals of restorative justice.  This model to some extent humanises the crime committed and can be beneficial to the victim, offender, the wider community and the Exchequer.We have a considerable amount of legislation on the Statute Book in the area of justice, equality and law reform and yet the whole area of the victims of crime has largely been ignored.  The Fine Gael Victims Rights Bill, which was published recently, is a concerted effort to address this shortcoming.  I look forward to debating the Victims Rights Bill in this House and urge all Deputies to support it.  A restorative justice system will not deal with all offenders.  The measures included in the Children Act 2001 such as community sanction and the diversion programme have an obvious potential and should continue to form part of the juvenile justice system and be expanded upon.The Irish prison chaplains' annual report for 2006-07 states that 50% of inmates at St. Patrick's Institution are illiterate.  This is a shocking statistic and reveals much about our justice system.  There is an obvious link between juvenile offence and education.  Given that St. Patrick's Institution is regarded in the prison chaplains' report as a preparatory school for the Mountjoys and Wheatfields is it not time for a different approach?  The possibility of offering an incentive towards sentence reduction if inmates participate in furthering their education with a view to completing State examinations, is one which could prove to be of benefit.The role of juvenile liaison officers in the Garda Síochána is key to the implementation of any successful juvenile justice system.  I have met many of these officers since my election last summer and I would like to take this opportunity to commend them on their work.  JLOs are at the coalface in dealing with juvenile crime.  Unfortunately, however, their decision-making abilities and powers have been somewhat reduced and eroded by the amount of legislation with which they must contend.  Some 14,500 annual referrals are made to the national juvenile office involving young offenders aged between 12 and 18.  This process involves the investigating officer reporting to the sergeant, the sergeant reporting to the superintendent, the superintendent reporting to the national office, and the latter office reporting back to the juvenile liaison officer.  This would appear to be a system that is heavy on bureaucracy and inefficient in operation.  Surely a system with more decision-making abilities at the front end would be more productive and responsive.The adoption of the UK system of anti-social behaviour orders, or ASBOs, was much heralded during the last Government's period in office.  However, since such orders came into force for juveniles on 1 March 2007, no ASBOs have been issued.  This underutilisation of a legislative mechanism to deal with public order is surprising and I wonder if the Minister has an opinion on it.  There appears to have been a rush towards an apparent solution without putting in place the necessary supports and resources.The issue of community policing has fallen somewhat off the political radar and is lower on our list of priorities.  Since the introduction of the scheme in 1991, we have seen a reduction in the numbers of gardaí participating in the community policing programme and a reallocation of resources.  Like the juvenile liaison officer system, community policing offers the most effective means of maintaining our civil society, yet only 4% of the force comprises community gardaí.  The solution is quite simple: provide resources for those working at the coalface; put more gardaí on our streets instead of doing desk work; and minimise the bureaucratic hindrance of their duties.  If this approach is taken results will follow.The terms of this Fine Gael Private Members' motion are clear.  The Government has a chance to make a real difference for every community and can display its intent to tackle anti-social behaviour and increased levels of knife crime.  Historically when this House has acted with conviction we have achieved results.  Sadly, there is an increase in the severity of actions by some in our society.  We have seen a progression towards the shameful incident in Drimnagh involving the horrendous murder of two young Polish men with the use of a screwdriver as a weapon.  We have seen a number of murders committed by youths over nothing more than mobile phones.  What type of society is Ireland becoming?We are at a crossroads, so I ask the Minister to accept this motion.  He should put resources at the frontline for community development, community policing facilities and juvenile liaison officers.  In that way we could begin to reverse the decline in law and order in a concrete fashion.  I strongly support the motion.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The savage killing last week of two Polish men in Drimnagh caused widespread shock and revulsion.  It signalled a new low in a society that is becoming increasingly steeped in violence.  We have become used to hearing most weekends about people being attacked and suffering serious injury or even death.  As for gangland crime, we seem quickly to have become used to the almost daily news that another gang member has been shot.  It is shocking to think about the amount of violent crime that is now prevalent on our streets.  This was a country that 20 years ago had little violent crime.In extending his condolences to the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Donald Tusk, on the deaths of the two Polish men last week, the Taoiseach said that the people of Ireland were shocked and saddened to hear of the violent attack.  He also said it was a tragedy which had nothing to do with the fact that both men were Polish.  He believed the attacks were random, and it could have been anyone who happened along that night.  That is the sad reality this country is facing today.  The Taoiseach said the attack was an isolated incident, but it was not.  We may not like to face up to unpalatable facts, especially when offering condolences to the Prime Minister of another country because two of its citizens were murdered in cold blood on our streets.  However, this was not an isolated incident.For some time, we have had proof that teen violence is spiralling out of control.  Young teenagers are arming themselves with knives, blades and other dangerous implements before going out on the streets.  Six years ago a young man by the name of Brian Higgins was stabbed by a 15 year old who was trying to steal his mobile phone.  We should also remember Brian Murphy, the young man kicked to death outside Annabel's nightclub in 2000.  His family still mourn their loss.  They are only two families concerned, however.  A young librarian from Sligo, Barry Duggan, was kicked to death on Dublin's Grafton Street in 2003.  How many families have to lose members before real action is taken?The public copes with gangland crime by thinking that those involved are organised crime figures, set apart, little deserving of our sympathy as they go about slaughtering each other.  Let us remember first of all that our gardaí must deal with these people as they try to enforce the laws of the land.  We do not serve them well or properly by treating such people as untouchables.  They must be treated the same as all others who are outside the law but more resources are needed to tackle organised crime.  Fighting such crime will not be cheap.  The Government will have to redeploy resources from other areas and that may be an unpopular move.Last Monday, two men charged in connection with an arms haul in Cork last year were sentenced to prison terms.  It followed a joint operation between the Garda Síochána and members of Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency.  The two men, part of a criminal gang, had been shopping for weapons, including two rocket launchers, Kalashnikov assault rifles and Uzi submachine guns.  This was not in Pakistan or Afghanistan, but in Cork.It must be remembered also that at this time, a number of serious criminals are behind bars in this country thanks to the Garda Síochána's organised crime unit, the OCU.  I commend the Minister for establishing this unit on a permanent basis.  The OCU has been credited with the arrests of more than 100 gangland suspects, the seizure of millions of euro worth of drugs, and a reduction in the number of armed cash-in-transit robberies.  It proves that it can be done but it requires a cohesive, sustained approach.Those who think that gangland crime is a step removed from the rest of society would do well to remember Donna Cleary, the young woman who died after shots were fired indiscriminately at a house where she was attending a 40th birthday party.  The house came under fire because those responsible had not been allowed in.  They were vicious thugs as well as being cocaine and heroin addicts.  Who would believe that could happen in Dublin in 2006?  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said the event marked "a watershed point for all our thinking on these matters".  The Taoiseach said that "We had hit a new low".  We seem to keep hitting these new lows, as the Taoiseach will no doubt agree, after the events of last week.  Donna Cleary's family probably did not get much comfort from being told that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.Another victim was Anthony Campbell, a young apprentice plumber, executed as he installed a washing machine.  There will be more such cases as we witness criminals attacking each other with impunity in cars on city streets and motorways, and on public thoroughfares.  Much of it starts with anti-social behaviour, including acts of vandalism and rowdy behaviour escalating into intimidation of local residents.  Communities thus begin to live in fear.  People who work hard are entitled to live in peaceful communities and not be subjected to harassment and torment.The subject of ASBOs has been discussed by my colleagues.  This time last year, the European crime and safety survey, the most comprehensive analysis of crime, security and safety ever conducted in the European Union, found that Ireland has the highest levels of common crime.  The Gallup study found Ireland has the highest levels of assault with violence, sexual assaults and robberies in the EU, and that Irish people feel the most victimised by crime.  The risk of theft from the person in Ireland was found to be double the European average and we have the third highest rate of burglaries in the EU.  That was before last year's general election when promises were made to tackle crime, but instead we have had a head-in-the-sand approach.I will finish by asking the Minister some direct questions.  His record as Minister for Children was excellent.  Will he show similar courage now?  Where is the courage of Nora Owen as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance when, along with the then Taoiseach, they set up the Criminal Assets Bureau and brought through legislation in a matter of weeks?  They cut through all the red tape and bureaucracy.  Will the Minister show courage on this occasion when it is so badly needed?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The terms of the Fine Gael motion, containing unfounded criticism of the Government's record, make it inevitable that the House will divide on it.  Nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity the debate provides to discuss several difficult issues which we as a society must address.  The criminal justice system has a major role to play in tackling some of these issues and I will outline the substantial measures being taken in this regard.  Some of the types of behaviours referred to in the motion and amendment require responses that go beyond what any criminal justice system can be expected to achieve and pose profound and complex questions for society generally.This debate, as speakers have already mentioned, takes place in the shadow of the tragic deaths last week of Pawel Kalite and Mariusz Szwajkos.  These were young men making their lives in Ireland.  They were part of the growing Polish community which is  most welcome here and is adding greatly to the life of our nation.  I am not alone in appreciating the dignified, measured and generous response of the families of the two men, as well as representatives of the Polish community here, to the horror of what happened.  They have recognised the regrettable reality that this type of incident can happen anywhere.  Some members of the families have expressed the hope that these tragic deaths will lead to a debate on how to address the issue of violence, particularly by the young.I am in the course of making a series of appointments to the National Crime Council, which advises on a wide range of issues in regard to dealing with crime.  I had intended to include in the membership of the council a representative of our new communities.  In the tragic circumstances of recent days, I hope the House will agree it is right that I should consult with the Polish ambassador about nominating a person from the Polish community to serve on the council as the first representative of those communities.I intend to concentrate now on the positive, comprehensive and practical measures the Government is taking to address criminal behaviour.  It is not terribly productive to bandy about a plethora of statistics, either favourable or unfavourable.  The statistics cited by Deputy D'Arcy, for example, are at variance with the findings of the Central Statistics Office.  As I have said before, statistics are a cold comfort to victims of crime and, in any case, every crime is a crime too many.  It is important, however, that what we say is grounded in reality, which is that serious crime per head of population has decreased in the past ten years.  I say this not to minimise the extent of our crime problem but because it would be wrong to understate the achievements of members of the Garda Síochána and other agencies of the criminal justice system which confront criminal behaviour on our behalf on a daily basis.Every right-thinking person will agree that the number of deaths involving knives and similar weapons is a particular cause for concern.  The number of murders involving stabbing doubled last year from 18 to 36.  We already have strong penalties for offences involving knives.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Offensive Weapons Order 1991, which contain the criminal law on knives and offensive weapons, lay down strict prohibitions on such weapons and severe penalties for breaking those prohibitions.  It is an offence, for instance, to possess any knife or any similar article in a public place without good reason or lawful authority; to trespass with such weapons; and to produce any such weapon in a manner likely to intimidate another person in the course of committing an offence or in the course of a dispute or fight.  Any person found guilty of such offences is liable on conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to five years or both.  A person found guilty of murder through stabbing or otherwise is liable to the highest possible penalty of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.Nevertheless, the legislative provisions dealing with offensive weapons, and any other measures which might be taken to counteract their availability and use, are kept under constant review by my Department.  At my request, the Garda Síochána is conducting a review of the provisions of the legislation in the context of the increased use of offensive weapons in assaults and murders.  The purpose of the review is to identify aspects of the legislation that may require strengthening from an enforcement perspective.  I understand the Commissioner is finalising that review and will make a submission to me shortly.In the discussion about offensive weapons, there is one aspect of the problem we must confront.  Items used as offensive weapons are often items with legitimate, everyday, mundane uses.  This makes it almost impossible to distinguish by legal definition between knives that have a legitimate use and those the sale of which might be undesirable.  Any attempt to do so would prove futile in practice as ordinary kitchen knives or tools, the sale of which could not be prohibited, can be just as lethal in the wrong hands as anything that might be prohibited and are all too often the weapons used to cause death or serious injury.  That is why the law must concentrate on the circumstances in which these items are in a person's possession.We must get the message across that carrying knives is dangerous and wrong.  One way of addressing this is to introduce a long-term education and awareness-raising programme aimed particularly at young people.  As part of its policing plan for this year, the Garda has decided to launch a publicity campaign aimed at discouraging people from carrying knives.  This will be in addition to taking rigorous action under the criminal law against those found carrying them.  This approach follows from the policing priorities I determined for this year, which include targeting the use of knives for violent attacks.I share the view that we have a problem with our patterns of drinking in this country.  It is clear that this problem is adding to public disorder.  This was the background to my establishment of the Government alcohol advisory group at the beginning of the year.  I have asked the group to examine urgently key aspects of the law governing the sale and consumption of alcohol, including those directed towards combating excessive and under-age alcohol consumption.  Issues of particular concern to me are the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences and how alcohol products are sold in such outlets, including below-cost selling and special promotions.  I have asked the group to report to me by the end of this month.  After Easter, I intend to bring forward urgent proposals for changes in the law which, with the support of both Houses, I hope will be enacted and implemented before the summer recess.In parallel with this, work will continue on the drafting of a comprehensive sale of alcohol Bill, which is already included in the Government's legislation programme for 2008 and which will modernise and streamline the law in this area.  On my appointment, I was not prepared to wait for the comprehensive consolidating Bill of 2008 for the purpose of introducing reforms.  The problem is so urgent that it requires immediate legislation.  We will not be able to tackle all the issues in the legislation that is to be enacted before the summer, but we need to make a start at it.The policing priorities I have set for the Garda Síochána in 2008 reflect the Government's focus on addressing the important areas of policing and crime prevention and detection.  They are supported by the continuing provision of substantial resources to the Garda.  The priorities I have set include targeting the use of knives in violent attacks and combating public disorder, in co-operation with other agencies and the community in general.  I have placed a particular emphasis on alcohol-related behaviour.  The Garda will tackle the use of offensive weapons, including illegal firearms.  The Garda Commissioner took into account the priorities I have set, which provide clear objectives for the Garda, when he drew up his policing plan for 2008.  His plan maps out the key objectives and actions required for the effective policing of our towns, cities and neighbourhoods and the ongoing modernisation and development of the force.As part of this work, the Commissioner has asked each assistant commissioner to prepare and implement a public order strategy for increasing enforcement and detection and reducing the recorded incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  The strategies will include the preparation and monitoring of operational plans for identified public disorder hotspots, including licensed premises, dancing venues, late night food outlets, public transportation hubs, taxi ranks and accident and emergency units of city hospitals, particularly at times which have been identified as high risk for such incidents, especially Thursday to Sunday nights and bank holiday weekends.  There will be additional high visibility uniform patrols by members of the Garda on beat, mobile and mountain bike duties.There will be increased enforcement by the Garda Síochána of existing legislation, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 relating to behaviour warnings and civil and behaviour orders for adults and juveniles.  The Garda will liaise with the licensees of off-licences, including convenience stores, with particular emphasis on the sale and supply of alcohol to people under the age of 18.  It will use its power to apply for closure and exclusion orders against licensees when offences contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Acts are detected.  The Garda is liaising with other relevant agencies and Departments to ensure a multi-agency approach to this cross-society problem.  It is the responsibility of everyone to prevent and assist Garda investigations arising from such incidents.Over the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in investment in the Garda Síochána.  The force's overall budget stands at over €1.6 billion this year, which is an all-time record high and an increase of 11% on the 2007 figure.  The Garda's budget over recent years has been used to make a significant investment in equipment and modern technology.  I was delighted to attend the recent launch of a new helicopter for the Garda air support unit.  The purchase of the helicopter represents a large investment in the Garda's air support capability, which is an essential aspect of modern policing.  The major ongoing programme of investment in the Garda fleet is aimed at improving and expanding the fleet of vehicles available to the force.  Over 1,700 new vehicles, or over 70% of the Garda fleet, have been acquired over the last two years.  Almost €100 million has been provided in this year's budget for a range of information technology projects to support the Garda in its fight against crime.  I emphasise that there is no basis for the suggestion that Operation Anvil is being wound down.  The Commissioner will continue to allocate resources to the operation as appropriate.  I remind the House that Garda expenditure on overtime for the first two months of this year was higher than for the same period last year.The introduction of joint policing committees was one of the most significant innovations in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  The basic idea behind the committees was to provide a forum in which the Garda and the relevant local authority, which are the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area, can discuss in a structured way the matters affecting the policing of that area.  The committees can make recommendations on such matters in conjunction with Members of the Oireachtas and community interests.  They meet an identified need and have great potential to ensure that policing is responsive to local needs.  The Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, called yesterday evening for the establishment of a community forum at local level.  I consider local policing committees to be the point of departure for any community forum because they comprise the democratically elected representatives of the people.  The Garda always tries to be accountable to, and responsible for, the people.The joint policing committees monitor two broad areas — the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour, particularly patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs, and the broader issue of the factors underlying and contributing to crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Based on such monitoring, the committees advise local authorities and the Garda on how they might best perform their functions and improve the safety and quality of life of communities.  Each committee can reach out to the local community by arranging and hosting public meetings on matters affecting the policing of the local authority area.  While it is right that a great deal of media attention focuses on serious forms of crime, such as gangland crime and homicide, we must not forget that the day-to-day lives of the vast majority of the people we serve are much more likely to be directly affected by crimes which might be classified as less serious, but can have serious adverse affects on the quality of life in our communities.  Such adverse affects are especially prominent when the offences in question are persistent.I have made it clear since I was appointed as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that I value partnership in tackling crime.  The joint policing committees are the cornerstone of that approach.  They represent a forum in each community where issues can be addressed.  I issued the guidelines under which the committees operate after consulting the relevant Ministers.  As the committees are a new and innovative development, the Ministers decided that before the committees were established in all local authority areas, they should be established on a pilot basis for a limited period in a variety of locations throughout the country.  A consultation seminar last November gave an opportunity to those involved in the committees which are up and running to discuss their experiences to date.  The deliberations were useful.I intend to establish a joint policing committee in each local authority area as soon as possible, probably towards the middle of this year.  This will require issuing a new set of guidelines.  Work is under way on revising the current guidelines to incorporate the experience gained in the pilot phase.  Respect is being given to the suggestions made at the November seminar in the preparation of the new guidelines.  My Department, through the Garda, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will provide financial assistance for the committees.  It is intended that the support will focus on the training and development of committee members, help to meet the travel expenses of community and voluntary sector representatives on the committees and support the staffing of the committees in the larger local authority areas.Community policing is built on the recognition that an effective way of addressing local problems of crime and anti-social behaviour is for agencies to work in an integrated way, based on the informal social mechanisms which already exist in communities.  In that way, it enlists the potential that exists among the public to contribute to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour.  Such an approach involves partnership between the Garda, the community and other relevant agencies.  The Garda Síochána is committed to providing a visible presence at local level throughout the State.  Community policing is an important mechanism to that end.  The Garda has been convinced of the value of community policing for some time.  It has been considering how to increase further its profile and effectiveness within the organisation.  The Garda Commissioner has established a working group to develop a comprehensive model of community policing.  Submissions were invited from the public and voluntary and statutory agencies last year, to be considered in developing the new model.  The final report of the working group is under consideration by the Garda authorities.The Garda is involved in important partnerships such as the community alert programme and neighbourhood watch.  There have been significant developments in these areas.  While high levels of investment are essential, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Garda Síochána's most important resource is its people.  The force needs to build strong relationships on the ground by maintaining a visible presence.  The Garda mountain bike unit, which was introduced on a pilot basis in 2001 in Tallaght and Raheny Garda districts, is a good example of such an initiative.  The unit has expanded nationwide since then — 359 mountain bikes are now in use in the force.  The unit has been successful in tackling anti-social and disorderly behaviour in local parks and estates.  It works well in conjunction with other units.  Its success can be attributed to its commitment, its ability to respond quickly and effectively and its capacity to provide a highly visible presence.  The mountain bike unit has made a significant and positive contribution to a more proactive approach to tackling crime.  Garda management has received a positive response from communities where such units are in operation.  Community gardaí use mountain bikes whilst patrolling their respective allocated areas.  The bikes are a major asset to the unit as they provide an excellent off-road mode of transport.  They allow members to patrol parks and green areas in an effective manner.  They facilitate ease of access throughout estates, laneways, footbridges, pedestrianised areas, shopping centres and other areas. I am pleased the Commissioner is significantly expanding the mountain bike unit.  He will shortly have a new contract in place for the purchase of an additional 130 bikes, a 36% increase on present provision, at a purchase cost of over €100,000.  He has included an option within that contract for the purchase of a further 130 bicycles.The Government has made very substantial progress in the area of youth justice.  There has been a very significant increase in investment in the area and a structural approach is now in place for tackling youth offending.  I should also mention the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, which is part of the programme for this Government as well as that of the principal Opposition party, and cares for the victims of crime.  It ensures they are respected within the criminal justice system at every possible stage.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on an extremely important issue.  First I express my sympathies to the families of the two Polish men murdered recently in Dublin.  Their parents lost these two sons to emigration less than a year ago, which must have been difficult for them at that time.  To bring their children home in a box must be particularly traumatic and my sympathies are with them.I attended the remembrance mass last night in Drimnagh and it was heartening to see a community reclaim and restate its own sense of community after such horrible and cruel murders.  There is no doubt that crime is a major challenge to every society in the world and Ireland is no different.  It seems as we become wealthier as a nation, we become more detached as a community.As the Minister stated, no crime is victimless and nobody deserves to be the subject of an act of violence.  Earlier today I heard Deputy Rabbitte asking what the Minister was going to do about groups of young people loitering with intent.  I only caught the comment briefly so I may be misinterpreting what the Deputy said.  Unfortunately, this is the sort of perception that does not assist anyone when making an effort to deal with an extremely sensitive issue.It is important to remember that not every group of young people will attack older people when they walk by and not every older person realises that the noisy group in front of them is not about to assault that person.  There is clearly a disconnect between older people and young people and a lack of understanding of youth culture.  Young people are not aware of how older people feel when they see a large group of young people shouting or enjoying themselves.  This disconnect must be addressed and, as Fr. Cosgrove said at last night's mass, this must be done from the ground up.  It must be done in schools, youth clubs and sports clubs, and most importantly, at home by parents.  We do not need more legislation, we need more education.I am glad this issue is receiving attention both within this Chamber and from the media.  I am glad this Government has clearly prioritised the health and safety of its citizens.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, whom we have just heard, is at the helm of a Department which is successfully providing resources to tackle crime, combating the causes of crime and dealing with the aftermath, which is just as important.  The Minister listens and when there is a national conversation on crime it is important to have a Minister who does this.There is no doubt that those who carry out criminal offences do so for a number of reasons.  As there is not a single reason, there is not a single measure that will cure all our ills.  One Department will not resolve all the issues around crime.  The advocates of locking people up and throwing away the key will sound good.  We should face the fact that this motion and the rhetoric addressing it appeal to our collective sense of fear and concern for the health and safety of children and parents.  The motion does not offer any real solutions because what is needed is a complex set of actions.  The Minister and this Government are working to lead and not scare people.One piece, and only one small piece, in the jigsaw is policing.  This is vital in ensuring not only that criminals are caught but also to provide reassurance and security to ordinary citizens.  The programme for Government has committed to an increase in gardaí to 15,000 by 2010 and 16,000 by 2012.  I am told we are on track to reach this target.The Department has also launched a 2008 policing plan.  This outlines key objectives for 2008, including the facilitation of joint policing committees; the tackling of gun crime, organised crime and drugs; and increasing public order.  The plan includes a commitment to a publicity campaign directed at the use of knives in serious crime.  The plan creates closer synergy between local authorities and Garda divisions.  Resources have clearly been provided by the Government to the Garda to the tune of €1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of 11% since 2007.There is no doubt the consumption of alcohol plays a major role in crime.  Garda activity has been very strong in this area and in my constituency of Dublin South-East there has been a concerned effort to address this issue.  There has been an increase of 19.7% in the detection of possession of drugs for sale or supply and this has a deterrent effect on potential criminals.This Government has also prioritised the need to discourage under age drinking and anti-social behaviour.  This has been backed up by legislation including the Intoxicating Liquor Act amended in 2000, which provides for closure orders for serving under age persons.  We have recently seen a debate on the selling of alcohol in outlets such as petrol stations and supermarkets.  I strongly believe there should be a complete ban on the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and petrol stations.  Unless this is done we are just asking for trouble.  It is healthy that we engage in this debate and question the effect of easy access to alcohol, particularly for young people.  In my constituency of Dublin South-East, I see many local community groups working very hard on the ground, providing sports facilities and activities for young people. There is no doubt that this has a positive impact and discourages children from turning to anti-social behaviour.Fianna Fáil-led Governments have rightly invested significant sums of money in improving facilities for young people.  Ringsend Park is a tribute to this commitment and we need to continue creating and improving facilities for young people.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is continuing to tackle the drugs problem through the national drugs strategy and is in the course of preparing a new strategy.Nobody would deny that knife crime must be combated as a matter of urgency.  However, as the Minister indicated, it is a complex issue and what this Opposition motion is omitting is that there has been a mixture of trends in recent years.  For example, there was an increase in headline crime of 1.7% in 2007 but the level of crime per 1,000 people has actually decreased.  There was a reduction in the number of burglaries by 5.4% in 2007 and the number of stabbings increased to 36 in 2007.I notice in the motion a focus on the use of knives.  As far as I am aware, a number of deaths by stabbing not too far away from here in Dublin South-East have occurred with the use of kitchen knives.  These knives were not bought in a knife shop or procured illegally.  These people went home, picked knives from a drawer and then committed the stabbing.  So how does the Opposition propose to deal with knives in our kitchen drawers?  The motion sounds dramatic but it demonstrates that the Opposition wants headlines rather than to tackle the issues in a serious way.  The motion's focus on the availability of knives detracts from the complexity of the issue.  It is not just about availability, as the Opposition would have us believe, as there are knives in every kitchen in the country.  Instead it is about tackling the root causes of violence as well as ensuring the provision of necessary resources.This Government is prioritising crime.  We have increased resources and funding.  The new policing plan for 2008 has been launched and as a result, the number of gardaí will be increased to 15,000 in 2010.  An holistic approach that recognises the multifaceted nature of crime has been adopted.  I am certain this Government and the Minister are working effectively on this issue.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on the issue of random violence and weapons on our streets.  The murder of two Polish men in my constituency ten days ago has been the catalyst for much debate and public outcry on the issue of violence in our communities.  We can only hope that the wanton and vicious attack on these two men resulting in their deaths will bring about some sense of responsibility and some real action from this Government to curb the ongoing attacks in our communities.  This, however, is little consolation to the families and friends of the two law-abiding Polish men who died.It seems this Government only wakes up to the level of violence on our streets in the wake of a brutal attack such as this one.  However, the reality unfortunately is that violence has become commonplace.  Every weekend there are reports of stabbings, shootings, beatings and much more gratuitous violence.It should be stated that the level of violence now experienced is not exclusive to any particular area or class.  It seems to be all-pervasive and random.  In recent weeks in my constituency, the following cases came to public attention.  A doorman at a nightclub was shot because he refused entry to someone.  A young girl was beaten up by a group of her peer age group for no other reason it would appear than she was not Irish.  A young man was executed by the canal and, most recently, there were the two Polish victims.Sadly these events are the ones that have entered the public domain but many more incidents classified as "minor" go unreported or attract very little attention, although somebody may have ended up paralysed because of an unprovoked attack.  The events I describe are by no means exclusive to my constituency.  Listening to all those who spoke this evening, it would appear to be almost the norm throughout the country.As public representatives, we are obliged to do everything we can from a legislative, social and policy perspective to tackle this issue.  There are some short-term measures which can and must be put in place to address the level of crime now ravaging communities.  The role of community gardaí must be enhanced because all the indicators are that where there is a prominent community Garda presence, crime levels are reduced.  However, as I highlighted previously in another context, four of the five stations in Dublin South Central — Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Sundrive Road and Terenure — have fewer community gardaí than the average in the Dublin metropolitan region.  This deficit must be rectified immediately.In the Drimnagh area, where this appalling and vicious event occurred last week, relations between the community gardaí and the local community are excellent but there is only so much the gardaí can do if they are under-resourced and if there are not enough gardaí to take charge and tackle this problem.  While the role of community gardaí is hugely important in the community, they act as something of a sticking plaster.  We need to look at the fundamental problems causing this anti-social behaviour and violence in the community.Alcohol and substance abuse were mentioned by speakers on all sides.  As we heard, alcohol can now be purchased in almost every garage forecourt, supermarket and off-licence attached to a pub.  Earlier today Deputy Eamon Gilmore quoted statistics I recently accessed via my colleague, Councillor John Gallagher, which showed that in Dublin South Central in 2007, there were 15 applications for off-licences.  Some 14 of these were granted with just one refusal.  It is not as if there was a dearth of off-licences in a particular area because two off-licences were sanctioned within four doors of each other.  The review of off-licences the Minister promised is long overdue but I will certainly welcome the report.The need for better services and facilities for young people has been raised.  On this issue, we must move with the times and engage with young people to find out what activities and services they would like and would use.  However, the services currently in place must be made available and be appropriate to all age groups.  They must be available at the time when young people want to use them.  What is the point of closing the doors of these facilities at 6 p.m. with youth workers going home, as happens in some cases?A cold hard look at value for money from our investment in youth services and facilities would be welcome.  There will always be a need for new different ideas and outlets, so we should be open to providing those young people tell us they want and not what we think they might want.This motion calls for a review of the availability of knives.  While I appreciate the significance of trying to achieve that, it would be very difficult to implement as kitchen knives would be available.  In addition to knives, many more weapons are widely available.  I welcome the points made by Deputy Charles Flanagan who put forward some ideas which have been implemented in the UK and particularly in Northern Ireland.  These ideas are worth trying but it will be difficult to make progress.The fundamental question that must be addressed is why these out of control young people behave the way they do.  Gratuitous violence is the order of the day on most television programmes and in many films and videos which are readily available.I am a great supporter of young people participating in sporting activities.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on sport, I will always be very supportive of that but I ask for a review of the many sporting activities where one sees players engaging in violent aggressive behaviour towards each other.  Perhaps those responsible for setting the standards in sport would like to take a look at the impact of this type of fighting and aggression on young people who aspire to become involved in sport.  I am very much in favour of providing sporting facilities but let us look at one of the downsides.As far as television and videos are concerned, the genie is out of the bottle and nothing can be done.  We have moved on and the challenge is to change the way people think about the violence which, in many cases, is being force-fed to them on a daily basis.What is the role of the family in ensuring the children for whom it is responsible are not involved in crime and anti-social behaviour?  The values of our society must be tackled in the family home.  Schools do their best, often battling against the odds, to provide structure and boundaries, particularly for children they know are at risk.  However, what explanation can a parent give for six and seven year olds being allowed to wander about unsupervised and falling prey to vultures who use him or her to help break the law?  I refer to incidents of small children being used to steal, break into shops, damage cars and carry drugs.Where are the HSE and the social workers?  What is the role of the National Educational Welfare Board when these children do not attend school?  There are unfortunate parents who are unable or unwilling to be responsible for their children.  Intervention is urgently needed in these cases.  The real problem is a lack of support for families at risk.  There are few supports and no sanctions, so why should these parents bother?  Will the Minister look at the needs of families at risk and intervene to break the cycle?  Until there is intervention at the earliest stage, the cycle will continue.No amount of knife and weapon amnesties will change the mindsets of those intent on doing damage to their communities and individuals.  The interventions now needed must be addressed collectively, but most fundamentally in the home.  The community, the various State agencies and most of all the families must get together to find an agreed way forward on this huge issue.  This Government must take responsibility for ensuring that all the main players come together and that there is connectivity between the various agencies.  It is not good enough to wring our hands and say how awful this blight is on all of us.We must bring these thugs — the untouchables — to justice.  We have been very polite about them for a long time but it is time to move on, call it like it is and ensure justice is done and is seen to be done.  We must ensure parents have their rights but we must enforce their responsibilities as well.  We must address the abuse of alcohol, binge drinking and drugs and put more community gardaí on the streets and give them the support they need.

It will also go beyond the latter in order to ensure that which we are debating, and that upon which we will vote, represents a proper response rather than an approach such as that to which I refer.The Government and its spokespersons and backbenchers do not seem to be aware of the extent of violent crime in our society.  If they were, they would not have had the audacity to table amendment No. 1, which is a disgrace.  We are discussing this motion on the back of the public's revulsion at the reprehensible murder of two Polish men in my constituency.  At the same time, however, the Government is praising itself for all the good things it has done.  It is time the Government woke up to the extent of the problem.Like Deputy Catherine Byrne, I can discuss matters with my constituents.  I invite the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to engage in such discussions with their constituents.  This problem does not just relate to Drimnagh, Ballyfermot or wherever.  If Ministers got out of their ministerial cars on occasion and spoke to people, they would be aware that their constituents are living in fear and that elderly individuals are no longer prepared to go to the shops on their own.  They will also discover that the Garda does not respond quickly enough for most people.  By the time gardaí arrive on the scene — one or two hours or perhaps more later — the perpetrators of crime have left.  In many instances, the young people who are out of their heads on cocaine and who are hassling others at chip shops or outside pubs or off-licences or who are engaging in raves outside people's houses have usually dispersed by the time officers arrive.I accept that An Garda Síochána is struggling because of a lack of resources.  In addition, its members do not have proper equipment.  The Minister praised himself earlier, stated how great he is and highlighted the amount of money that has been invested in An Garda Síochána.  The force does not even have a half decent radio system to allow its members to communicate with each another and with their barracks.  Gardaí are obliged to use their own mobile phones to maintain contact.  However, the Minister earlier lauded his response and that of the Garda.Successive Governments were content to pass law after law but they failed to focus on the causes of crime.  Neither did they place an emphasis on why the continual increase in violent crime.  Lack of respect, materialism and drug and alcohol misuse are some of the causes of crime.  People are engaging in gratuitous, mindless thuggery and violence.A much greater level of resources needs to be pumped into crime prevention measures, drug schemes, the provision of services to the victim of crime, rehabilitation, and diversionary programmes.  If proper investment is made in these areas, results will be forthcoming.Since I was first elected in 2002, I have called for the adoption of an approach similar to that taken in respect of foot and mouth disease.  We should take an all-hands-on-deck approach to the scourge of drugs.  We must recall the promise that foot and mouth disease would not kill a solitary soul.  However, drugs and gun-related crime are destroying our communities.All organs of the State should be mobilised to tackle drug-related crime head on.  In the opinion of most gardaí and criminologists, approximately 70% of crime in our society is drug related.  We should, therefore, tackle the causes and deal with what is causing people to become involved in drug abuse and drink more and more alcohol.  If we do this and take steps to confiscate the profits of the drugs barons, we will have achieved something worthwhile.This Government and its predecessors stand indicted for their failures.  In the 1980s when communities cried out for help and eventually took to the streets, the Government response was to batter them down.  We still do not have a proper response to the drug crisis in this or any other city.  Individual communities and Sinn Féin have continually flagged the need for a proper response.  I am sure we could turn the tide if such a response was forthcoming.  If we do not tackle this problem, it will become much worse and we will witness further events similar to those in Drimnagh.I appeal to Ministers to get real and not to engage in self-praise when tabling amendments.  The Government should put in place proper responses.  The necessary laws and gardaí are in place.  We should direct the latter to where the problems lie.  We need to focus on community policing.  On Question Time, the Minister referred to the effectiveness of community policing.  If it is so effective, why can he not demand that the Garda Commissioner, as is the case with the traffic corps, ring-fence the number of community gardaí?  If we deploy sufficient numbers of community gardaí, we will be able to rebuild the confidence of communities in the force as a whole.  In addition, we will be in a position to bring to an end people's fear in respect of approaching An Garda Síochána.People need to have confidence in An Garda Síochána in order that they can work with individual officers and ensure they are effective not only in policing communities but in ensuring that crime does not occur in the first instance.  The most effective way to tackle anti-social behaviour is to provide communities and the victims of crime with an assurance that the State will protect them.For over a year, I have been calling for a pilot scheme initiated in Blanchardstown to be rolled out elsewhere.  I refer to the "Dial to Stop Drug Dealing" scheme, under which an anonymous telephone line was provided to encourage those who feared approaching An Garda Síochána or using ordinary telephone lines to share information with the force on drugs or drug-related crime.  People who used the special telephone line could not be identified and could not then become targets for mindless thugs.  The pilot scheme in Blanchardstown led to the arrest and prosecution of many drug dealers.  This is a great scheme but the Minister will not put his money where his mouth is in respect of it.  Rolling the scheme out across the city, or the country in general, would not cost a great deal.  If it was rolled out, communities and individuals living in fear would have an avenue by which to report crime.  If it only led to the imprisonment of one drug dealer or one violent criminal, it would still be worth it.I stated earlier that almost 70% of crime is drug related.  In such circumstances, any action which frustrates this multi-billion euro industry and the crime associated with it must be welcomed.  Every shipment of drugs that enters this country seems to be accompanied by a huge number of weapons.  We have not previously seen the importation of these illegal weapons, which are being used on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, on such a scale.  The availability of such weapons is leading to violence, shootings and murder.  One need only consider what has happened in Drimnagh and Dublin South-Central in this regard in recent times.  An ongoing drugs feud in the area, which has not been properly dealt with, has led to 11 people being killed.  In addition, a doorman and a garda were shot by those involved in the feud.  These drug-fueled crimes would not have happened if the Government or its predecessors had taken seriously calls for a proper approach to be adopted.The scale of the lawlessness in Dublin city, particularly in the community I represent, is such that criminals are driving around tooled up with weapons and wearing bullet-proof vests.  Only a small minority is engaged in this type of activity.  Most people are law-abiding but live in fear because of the State's failure to stand up to those involved in drug crime.  The example they give to the young, alcohol-fuelled criminals coming up behind them is that it is okay to carry on in this way.  It is not okay.  If the State is not willing to come up to the mark, communities will have to take to the streets as they did in the 1980s.  We have learnt our lessons from that period but if all arms of the State are not willing to stand up, the communities will take to the streets and ensure that this violent trend and the increasing drug scourge are tackled head on.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I thank Deputy Crawford for allowing me to speak first.  A staff member of the New York Blood Centre was in public with a laptop containing the records of donors to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS.  That person was mugged, his laptop taken and all the records have disappeared.  The manner in which these things happened is weird and wonderful.  There is a touch of James Bond about this but one has to ask why the disc was encrypted and put on a laptop.  The purpose of a laptop is ease of transport for use in a variety of areas.  Why was the laptop brought into the public domain in New York and what actually happened?  It occurred, as I understand it, on 23 October 2007 but seems to have been kept quiet until the new year.  Why was this information only recently made public?Tens of thousands of Irish citizens gave blood in good faith, in the expectation that all the information they supplied, personal details of their names, addresses, dates of birth and blood types, would have been confidential and would not enter the public domain in any way.  The people whose confidential information was lost in that mugging received a letter from the IBTS, explaining in a technical fashion the method of encryption, the process that occurred and why the IBTS set up an agreement with the New York Blood Centre, but it does not explain why the information was on a laptop.  Why was it not sent in a more confidential fashion?  Why was it sent at all?  The IBTS said it wanted to provide the best data control system available and therefore it employed the services of the New York Blood Centre.  Why did it not bring an expert to Ireland?  It beggars belief that anybody from the IBTS in his or her right mind would take a disc with all that information, transfer it to a laptop, put it surreptitiously in his or her luggage and carry it around the streets of New York where he or she was mugged.  In Britain recently a large volume of confidential information that had been stored also got into the public domain.  We do not know what will happen to that.The IBTS says the information was securely encrypted and that it would be impossible to break the code.  It may be impossible to break it but it is not impossible to find it.  Where was the code?  Was there a password, was it in somebody's head or written down in any way?  We do not know the answers to those questions or what might happen to that information in the future.Will the Minister of State tell us in the first instance why it took so long for the IBTS to make this common knowledge and to write to the people concerned?  The mugging took place on 23 October 2007 but the letters were not sent out until 22 February 2008.  Will the Minister of State give us the up-to-date information on what has happened so far in respect of the investigation and whether there is any prospect of retrieving the information?
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I welcome the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to address the issue raised by the Deputy and to set out the current position on the theft of a laptop in New York containing Irish blood donor records.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, entered into an agreement with the New York Blood Centre, NYBC, for the provision of a data query tool on 23 October 2007.  The tender was carried out in compliance with EU procurement rules.  The NYBC was the successful tenderer.  The IBTS entered into a five-year licence, services and support agreement with the NYBC.  The purpose of the data warehousing and reporting tool being developed in conjunction with NYBC is to improve the existing IBTS blood banking computer system, Progesa, in order to provide a better service to its donors and clients.  Under the terms of that agreement, the IBTS exported data on CD from its Progesa system.  The data was encrypted using a 256 bit key encryption, prior to export on a CD.On 7 February, an NYBC employee was carrying a laptop to enable him to continue to work on the data outside office hours.  The employee was mugged and the laptop stolen.The IBTS is very conscious of its obligations under the data protection Acts to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.  In this instance, the IBTS is confident that it has complied with these obligations by virtue of the robust security measures taken by the IBTS and NYBC.  They both consider that the risk of any person being in a position to bypass password controls and decrypt the data is extremely remote.The IBTS informed the Data Protection Commissioner on the next working day after the theft, 11 February 2008, of the details of the case and the commissioner has been in regular contact with the IBTS, which has co-operated fully with the investigation.  The commissioner has noted publicly that the IBTS had a legitimate reason to send the data out of the country, that it had taken its responsibilities to donors and clients seriously and that the information had been securely encrypted.The Data Protection Acts specifically exclude disclosure to employees or agents.  It was agreed between the parties that the NYBC would act as an agent of the IBTS for the purposes of the agreement.  Therefore, as an agent of the IBTS, the disclosure of personal data to the NYBC does not constitute disclosure within the meaning of the Acts.  At no time were these records ever unencrypted and the IBTS will continue to take every measure to protect the personal records of donors.The IBTS has contacted all 171,324 donors affected directly to assure them that the data was protected by state of the art encryption.  It has provided an information line to donors who were concerned about the data loss and since this matter became public, the IBTS has dealt with over 3,000 calls as well as many letters and e-mails from concerned donors.  These donors were from all over the country.The Minister is satisfied that in this case the IBTS acted appropriately and has taken, as confirmed by the Data Protection Commission, all reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of its donors.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue and I thank the Minister for State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, for answering, in the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.While this has specifically to do with the services being removed from Monaghan General Hospital, it is clearly a long-term plan of this Minister, with the backing of her Fianna Fáil and Green Party colleagues, to wind down the services at all small hospitals throughout the country.  The report by Mr. Stephen Mulvaney sent by Mr. Ray Mitchell to all Oireachtas Members in the north east clearly states on page 8 that the critical care unit, better known as the high care unit at Monaghan General Hospital, will be closed down this year, all acute services will be removed and that the 24 hour seven-day accident and emergency unit, previously known as the treatment room, will be wound down to a five-day 12 hour service, for minor issues only.  At the same time this same Executive advises on page 2 of the report that no service will be removed until an equally good or a better service is available.The reality is that the site of the new hospital for the north east has not even been announced.  Cavan General Hospital cannot cope with its present workload and the special adviser to the former health board, Mr. Finbarr Lennon, has advised by letter that the situation in Drogheda is completely unsafe because of its present workload.The Taoiseach in the Dáil today emphasised the fact that the distance from services will obviously mean that there can be delays in those services being delivered and to him that seemed to be acceptable.  However, as one who was glad to have the services of the high care unit in Monaghan General Hospital just last year, I am not prepared to sit idly by and allow such critical services to be removed.  On a continual basis I meet people whose lives have been saved by that unit and who certainly would not have survived the journey to either Cavan or Drogheda.During the period Monaghan General Hospital was "off call", at least 17 lives were lost unnecessarily and no doubt even in the last few days others would have been lost if we were in that same position.  At this late stage I urge the Minister, Deputy Harney, to consult with the senior personnel concerned in Monaghan General Hospital to explain to them how their patients will be dealt with after the proposals by the Health Service Executive are implemented.  She should stop the movement now, at least until the new hospital is working.I further ask my constituency colleagues whether they are happy that all these services should be removed at a time when general practitioners cannot get personnel to deal with all the demands within their structures.  Newcomers cannot get into general practice.  It is clear from a reply received from the Minister this evening that she does not understand what is happening within the sector.  She is clearly unaware of the lack of trust between the HSE, her officials, and the staff implementing systems on the ground.  It is even more clear that the Minister has allowed the HSE to get out of control — it simply takes its own decisions, as it likes — and she has no interest in ensuring that people's health is top priority.  Taxpayers' money should be properly utilised, given the fact that Monaghan General Hospital has a prime theatre, a first-class high quality treatment room and staff that can give a high quality and economic service.  However, this clearly means nothing to the Minister or this Government.I want to emphasise to the Minister of State that I am talking about a document issued by the HSE concerning the north east transformation programme.  It is not scaremongering, but rather stating simple facts.  The joke, however, is that it refers to "improving the safety and quality of patient care", and states that at its core the north east transformation programme is a risk mitigation strategy.How can a critical care unit be removed from Monaghan General Hospital, when the Minister does not even have a single bed to put patients into in Cavan or Drogheda and when the man in charge of Drogheda says the situation there is extremely serious and unsafe?   Yet HSE management — not the medical staff — is going ahead with the winding down and proposed closure within 2008 of those services at Monaghan General Hospital.  That situation is certainly not acceptable to me.  I am simply asking for some commonsense.Finally, I say without apology that the Minister, Deputy Harney, was able to travel to America the other day to look at new systems.  She has not once visited Monaghan General Hospital, or Cavan, for that matter.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.The Health Service Executive transformation programme is designed to build a health system that is appropriate to the 21st century and is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  The transformation programme is expected to deliver an integrated care system with local and regional hospitals functioning within a co-ordinated, integrated clinical network as part of the wider system of primary, community and continuing care.The HSE has advised that the north east transformation programme is approaching the end of its initial phase of planning and is moving towards detailed design and implementation.  Operational management and transformation management arrangements in the region have now been linked in order to achieve full integration of the transformation programme with the management of operations.The Department understands that the HSE north east made a presentation recently on the north east transformation programme to meetings of two committees of the regional health forum, Dublin and north east.  The HSE advises it emphasised a clear commitment that existing services in the region will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services.  It also emphasised that an indicative list of measures outlined in the presentation is a draft work in progress.The HSE has indicated that it is not possible until the detailed planning phase is complete to be definitive as to what aspects of the north east transformation will be implemented during 2008-09.  An indicative list which was included in the presentation is dependent on a range of factors including significant change management and changes to work practices.  The degree and pace of change will also be influenced by the extent to which resources can be freed up by the HSE for re-investment in transformation initiatives.  The HSE has advised that no decisions have been taken on reducing services in the north east.  The HSE is facing a challenging year and is exploring, in the case of the north east, how best to deliver on service plan targets within the level of resources available.With regard to the critical care unit in Monaghan Hospital, the Department is advised by the HSE that international best practice evidence suggests that in the region of 200 ventilations per annum for level 3 critical care is the appropriate critical mass of patients per annum.  This critical mass is related to improved patient outcomes and ensures the necessary skills and competencies required to deliver an optimal critical care service.The HSE has advised that less than 20 patients per annum fall into this category of level 3 critical care at Monaghan.  Since the intensive care unit in Cavan General Hospital has capacity to facilitate these patients, it is a priority for the HSE, as set out in the Teamwork report, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East,  to have these patients treated in Cavan.The relevant clinical transfer protocols and reconfiguration of anaesthetics across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group are being developed by the HSE critical care clinical network.  When these are completed the transfer of care will take place, thus improving the safety and quality of care for these patients.  The HSE has indicated that the relevant clinical protocols for the development of the minor injuries treatment unit at Monaghan hospital are currently being developed by the emergency care clinical network in conjunction with Cavan-Monaghan hospital group management.  There have been a number of significant improvements at Monaghan General Hospital, including two newly refurbished inpatient medical wards.  This project, which cost €5 million, consists of two 25-bed inpatient wards, one male and one female, each of which provides a range of multi-bedded and single rooms.  The ward project builds on the investment of €1.2 million in new equipment, an upgrade of the pharmacy and general facility upgrades for the hospital.

Significant developments have taken place regarding the provision of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital interface.  Emergency surgical services on a 24-hour, seven-day basis are provided on the Cavan site while significant elements of diagnostic, outpatient and day case services are provided on the Monaghan site.  This has resulted in lower waiting times for outpatient appointments and inpatient elective services.  Since the reconfiguration of Cavan-Monaghan surgical services, patients can be seen by the visiting consultant surgeon on the day of referral by the general practitioner.Monaghan General Hospital has an important role to play in the provision of health services in the north east.  This view was confirmed in the Teamwork report and also in the north-east transformation programme.

Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an t-Aire é féin anseo chun éisteacht leis an méid atá le rá agam agus, b'fhéidir, freagra deimhneach a thabhairt a thabharfaidh misneach do muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ar ndóigh, baineadh geit as gach éinne Déardaoin seo caite nuair a d'fhogair lucht Iasachtaí Críonna go raibh siad chun a gcuid monarcha a dhúnadh sna Ghaeltachtaí uilig, ó Ghaoth Dobhair i mo chontae féin, Dhún na nGall, siar go Maigh Eo agus síos go dtí an Daingean, i ndáilcheantar mo chomhghleacaithe, an Teachta Ó Síocháin.  Tá 108 post caillte, beagnach 40 acu i mo dháilcheantar féin.  Cuireann an dóigh inar láimhseáil an chomhlacht an fógra seo isteach go mór orainn mar ionadaí poiblí.  Tháinig na hoibrithe isteach maidin Déardaoin cosúil le gach lá eile, ach ag 3.10 i.n. an lá sin dúradh leo go raibh an monarcha le dúnadh ansin.  Bhí orthu dul abhaile gan teacht isteach riamh arís.  Ní bhfuair siad fógra d'aon chineál — seachtain, lá, nó fiú uair a' chloig.  Sílim gur droch-iompar amach is amach is ea oibrithe a thug seirbhís go dílis don tionscal a ligint chun siúil sa chaoi seo.Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh dóchas mór againn uilig i dTír Chonaill nuair a bunaíodh an tionscal seo cúpla bliain ó shin.  Tá mé cinnte go raibh áthas ar na Ghaeltachtaí eile nua-thionscal nach raibh bunaithe ar an ndéantúsaíocht nó an sean-tionscal traidisiúnta a fháil.  Cheap daoine gur bánú lá úr don Ghaeltacht ab ea na tionscail seo, go dtí go bhfuaireamar an buille Déardaoin seo caite.  Ní amháin go bhfuil mé ag caint faoi mo cheantar féin — Gaoth Dobhair, ar a bhfuil aithne maith ag an Aire, Chloich Cheann Fhaola agus na Rosáin.  Tá mé ag caint freisin faoi oibrithe as cheantar Cill Chartha — Gaeltacht iar-dheisceart na chontae — os rud é go ndúirt an chomhlacht seo go raibh sé chun 120 post a lonnú ansin.  Bhí an-obair déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le bliain anuas chun monarcha a ullmhú don tionscal úr.  Nuair a dhein an t-údarás suirbhé i gceantar Cill Chartha le bliain anuas, fuair sé amach go raibh 360 daoine óga ann ag feitheamh le fostaíocht.  Ar ndóigh, nuair a tháinig an fógra seo Dé Déardaoin seo caite, ní amháin gur chailleamar na postanna ar fud na Gaeltachta, ach chaill muintir Cill Chartha an dóchas a bhí acu go mbeadh postanna ar fáil dóibh sa tsamhraidh.I am delighted to have to opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Last Thursday's announcement by Contact 4 came as a thunderbolt out of the blue and resounded from Donegal to Dingle.  One hundred and eight jobs were lost, 40 of which were in Donegal.  They were wiped out in a flash without warning.  Workers who reported dutifully for work, as usual, on Thursday last were informed at 3.30 p.m. that afternoon that their jobs were gone.  No prior notice was given, nor was any indication of the impending doom.  The staff were just shown the door in a most brutal fashion.The announcement was a double whammy for Donegal.  In addition to there being disappointment in Gweedore over the loss of 40 jobs, the residents of Kilcar, who were expecting Contact 4 to locate there this spring, with the promise of 120 jobs in three stages, are deeply disappointed.  A survey carried out by Údarás na Gaeltachta in the Kilcar area in the past year found that 360 people in the locality were awaiting employment.  Need I say more?Donegal can ill afford the loss of these jobs.  It already has the highest unemployment rate in the entire country.  Coincidentally, a CSO survey issued last Thursday showed that the  per capita income in Donegal is the lowest in the country.  We all know there is a strong correlation between employment and income.  The higher the rate of unemployment, the lower the income.I appeal to the Minister, Údarás na Gaeltachta and any agencies available to retrain the workers, including FÁS, to redouble their efforts to replace the jobs as soon as possible.  Jobs have been draining out of the county, not only from the Gaeltacht, le roinnt blianta anuas.  I am delighted the Minister is present to respond, unlike some other Ministers, who do not have the time to take Adjournment debates.  I ask him to address the needs of the workers to whom I referred.  They are probably all the sole earners in their households.  They have great responsibilities and must make mortgage repayments and meet the cost of their children's third level education.  They are out of a job, have a bleak future and depend on the Minister and Údarás na Gaeltachta chun sólás a thaispeáint dóibh.

Mar a léirigh mé sa ráiteas poiblí a d'eisigh mé ar 28 Feabhra 2008 nuair a fograíodh an drochscéal maidir le fostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht, is cúis imní dom féin agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta aon phostanna a bheith á gcailliúint in aon tionscal Gaeltachta.  Tuigim go maith an imní atá ar an Teachta agus ar gach éinne faoin líon postanna atá caillte le dúnadh an chomhlachta Contact 4.  Tháinig an buille seo aniar aduaidh orainn ar fad, go háirithe na fostaithe nach bhfuair fógra leathlae féin fiú.  Is trua linn uilig gurb amhlaidh a bhí an scéal.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh a sheacht ndícheall déanta ag Údaras na Gaeltachta chun teacht ar chomhréiteach níos sásúla leis an gcomhlacht.  Ar an drochuair, ní raibh rath ar na hiarrachtaí an uair seo.Chuir príomhaí Contact 4 in iúl d'Údarás na Gaeltachta an tseachtain seo caite go rabhthas ag dúnadh na dtrí chomhlacht Gaeltachta atá ag feidhmiú i nGaoth Dobhair, in Acaill agus sa Daingean le feidhm láithreach mar gheall ar an titim thubaisteach ar an ngnó iasachtaí agus morgaistí a bhí mar dhúshraith ghnó ag an gcomhlacht sin.  Cuireadh an cinneadh seo in iúl dom Déardaoin seo caite.  Tuairiscíodh i nuachtán áirithe go raibh a fhios agam roimhe sin, ach ní raibh.  Maidin Déardaoin — an lá a fógraíodh an cinneadh — a dúradh liom go raibh na gcomhlachtaí le dhúnadh.Mar is eol dúinn uilig, thosaigh an cúngú sna margaí creidmheasa sa dara leath de 2007.  Ó shin i leith, tá titim leanúnach tromchúiseach ní amháin ar líon na morgáistí atá ar fáil sna margaí airgeadais sin ach, freisin, ar na téarmaí agus na coinníollacha a bhaineann le morgaistí agus iasachtaí infheistíochta go ginearálta.  Bhí Contact 4 ag feidhmiú mar bhróicéirí idirmheánacha sa mhargadh sin in Albain agus sa Ghaeltacht.  Ag tús na bliana, bhíothas ag súil go dtiocfadh biseach ar dhálaí an mhargaidh ach is amhlaidh gur in olcas atá cursaí ag dul.  Ar an mbonn sin, dúirt an comhlacht nach raibh de rogha acu ach gnó na gcomhlachtaí seo a scor.  Mar thoradh chinneadh an chomhlachta, tá a bpost caillte ag 108 duine sna hionaid Ghaeltachta, idir 79 duine ar bhonn lánaimseartha agus 29 eile ar bhonn páirtaimseartha.  Ó thaobh briseadh síos réigiúnda de, is 34 phost atá i gceist i nGaoth Dobhair — 26 lánaimseartha agus ocht páirtaimseartha.  Is 36 phost atá i gceist in Acaill — 26 lánaimseartha agus deich páirtaimseartha.  Is 38 bpost ata i gceist sa Daingean — 27 lánaimseartha agus 11 páirtaimseartha.  Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil deontais dar luach €3 milliúin íoctha leis an gcomhlacht.  Mar is iondúil, tá muirear ag an Údarás ar shócmhainní na n-ionad Gaeltachta chomh maith le barántais phearsanta agus mháthairchomhlachta.  Anuas air seo, beidh plé ar bun idir an t-Údarás agus an comhlacht i rith na míonna seo romhainn maidir le dliteanas a bhaineann leis an gcúnamh Stáit sin.Níl aon dabht gur buille trom é seo don Ghaeltacht ach caithfear a aithint go raibh na hionaid atá á ndúnadh ag feidhmiú go héifeachtach agus gur cúinsí taobh amuigh de smacht an chomhlachta ba chúis leis an gcinneadh atá déanta.  Tá sé cruthaithe ag Údarás na Gaeltachta gur féidir leis infheistíocht nua-aimseartha sna seirbhísí airgeadais — earnáil a ghineann go leor fostaíochta san eacnamaíocht náisiúnta agus domhanda — a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Beifear ag féachaint le tógáil ar an dúshraith scileanna atá forbartha san earnáil sin.  Ba mhaith liom aird a tharraingt ar chúrsaí fostaíochta i bpáirc ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair, áit a bhfuil breis is 750 duine fostaithe i gcliaint-chuideachtaí de chuid Údarás na Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire.  Is dea-scéal é seo nuair a chuimhníonn muid go raibh an figiúr seo tite faoi 450 sa bhliain 2003, tráth ar cailleadh líon mór postanna déantúsaíochta ansin.  Tá go leor infheistíochta á dhéanamh sa bpáirc ghnó seo, mar shampla fhorbairt áisleann Ghaoth Dobhar le lárionad ilfheidhmeach cultúrtha, pobail agus áineasa, ar chostas €8.8 milliún; áis súgartha, caitheamh aimseartha agus scíth a fhorbairt don phobal; agus staideár féidearthachta maidir le pictiúrlann, srl.Sa cheantar máguaird tá forbairtí tábhachtacha eile ar bun, mar shampla, leathnúchán ar ionad seirbhísí mara agus turasóireachta ag cé Machaire Rabhartaigh, ar costas €1.1 milliún; cultúrlann le 450 suíochán ag Ionad Chois Locha i nDún Luiche, ar costas €2.1 milliún; agus, mar a fógraíodh le déanaí, ionad fiontair agus pobail nua i Rann na Feirste, a bheidh ag fáil tacaíochta ón Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta agus ón údarás.  Chomh maith leis sin, dar ndóigh, tá ionad fiontair togtha ag Westbic i mBaile na Móna, Cill Charthaigh, ar chostas €1 milliún.  Go hachomair, tá an t-Údarás dóchasach gur féidir malairt deiseanna fostaíochta a chur ar fáil i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair sa ghearr go meántéarma ag éirí as tograí atá á bpróiseáil tríd an bpíblíne infheistíochta faoi láthair.  Beifear ag díriú aird ar leith i rith na míonna seo romhainn ar thograí nua a aimsiú do cheantair Acla agus an Daingean freisin.  Féachfar chomh maith le tionscadail oiriúnacha a aimsiú do cheantar Chill Charthaigh, áit a raibh sé beartaithe ag Contact 4 glao-ionad eile a bhunú níos moille i mbliana.Mar fhocal scoir, is féidir liom a gheallúint don Teach go mbeidh mo Roinn ag tacú leis an Údarás sna hiarrachtaí leanúnacha atá ar bun aige chun fostaíocht a ghiniúint agus a dhaingniú sa Ghaeltacht.  Sa chomhthéacs sin, tá os cionn €40 milliún curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinn don Údarás dá chlár gníomhaíochta sa bhliain 2008.  Ní mór a chur san áireamh freisin go mbíonn airgead breise — suas go €10 milliún — ar fáil don Údarás óna chlár díolacháin sócmhainní le cur leis an tsuim seo.  Tá mé dóchasach ón gcomhoibriú iomlán idir mé féin agus mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta, an Teachta Martin, agus go deimhin idir an t-Údarás, IDA Ireland agus Enterprise Ireland, go mbeidh rath ar na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun le déileáil leis na dúshláin chun a chinntiú go mbeidh deiseanna fostaíochta fiúntacha inmharthanachta ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta.  Mar is eol don Teachta McGinley, tá mé ag obair le tamall fada ar cheist na postanna i bhForas na Gaeilge atá le lonnú i nGaoth Dobhair.  Cúnamh mór a bheidh ann don cheantar sin.  Is é sin an chineál post nach n-imeoidh choíche.  Mar is eol don Teachta, tá ag éirí go maith leis na postanna a chruthaíodh ar an gCarraig, bunaithe ar obair an Acadamh Ríoga.  Creidim gur cheart go bhfaighidh na ceantair tuaithe a gcuid fhéin d'fhostaíocht an Stáit.  Bíonn tionchar nach beag ag fostaíocht den shórt sin ar ceantair tuaithe ar nós Gaoth Dobhair.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Killarney House is an historical building, part of a French-style house which was home to the Earl of Kenmare.  It was owned by the late Mr. John McShain, one of the biggest developers in America who redesigned the White House and built the Pentagon, who died in Killarney in 1989 and whose wife died in 1998.  They bought this estate in the 1950s and bit by bit, from 1970, started gifting it, including thousands of acres, to the Government.  There are many historic parts to it as well, including the monastic island of Innisfallen, Ross Castle and two of the lakes of Killarney.Later, for a nominal sum, they handed over thousands of acres of woodland and pasture while retaining life tenancy of Killarney House.  The last 21 acres were given to the State just two years ago.  Sr. McShain, the sole child of John and Mary McShain, stated recently that her parents would be heartbroken that the house they loved and restored is now neglected and to see the paint peeling off the walls.I tabled this matter because to the people of Killarney and Kerry, and to visitors, Killarney House is the body of Killarney.  This house is falling asunder.  The McShain's were given a commitment by the Government that it would be restored to its former glory and accessible to tourists and the public.  It is a disgrace.  It is shameful that this beautiful structure which was donated to the State has been allowed to decay and fall into ruin, especially in times of such affluence and prosperity.The Minister has stated that he is committed to restoring the house.  Given those words, I must ask how much money he will put into it and what he will do with it.  My colleague for south Kerry, Deputy Healy-Rae, announced last week that he has been given a commitment that money will be spent on Killarney House.  Nobody knows how much.  Nobody knows what work is to be done.  There are valuables from the house in paid storage at a cost of €70,000 a year.There is a commitment by the Minister to restore the House.  I want to know what that commitment entails.  How much money is involved?  What will it do?  Will there just be another few dehumidifiers put into the House to keep the rising damp at bay?  People want to know.It was intended that the parklands and the house would be enjoyed and appreciated by visitors and locals alike and not let run into a state of ruin.  In recent times it has been occupied by squatters.  This has been disregarded by the Minister but it is fact.  I spoke with people in the town hall in Killarney who confirmed that there had been squatters.  It is a disgrace.I and the people of Killarney and the surrounding areas want this house to become a heritage centre that would incorporate all matters of a historical and cultural nature relating to Killarney and County Kerry, the ancient monasteries of Innisfallen, Aghadoe, Muckross Abbey and Ross Castle.  It could be an interpretative centre.  We do not want merely to stop the rising damp and replace a few slates on Killarney House.  I ask that the firm commitment will be honoured by adequate funding after the costing has been done to provide this interpretative centre for Killarney.  It is in the heart of Killarney and it would really add to the core of the town.A National Parks and Wildlife Service plan was drawn up a number of years ago, a copy of which I have seen.  Such a plan should be fully costed and there should be public consultation on this issue.  It is well and good to think that we have experts from NPWS, with all due respects, and from the Minister's office who can decide for the people of Killarney and of the country how Killarney House could be best used on behalf of the State.  Following public consultation, the Minister should set up a task force that will come to a consensus on how Killarney House can best be used.  He must provide the funding, not just for a few more dehumidifiers, but to bring the house back to its former glory, as Mr. McShain wanted.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  As the Deputy may know, Killarney House was discussed on the Adjournment in the Seanad last week.  I would like to place on the record of this House the details provided to the Seanad by the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.Killarney House and the greater part of the accompanying estate was sold to the State in 1978 by the then owner, Mr. John McShain, for a sum below market value, on the assurance that the house and the estate would be incorporated into Killarney National Park.  As part of the sale agreement, the McShains had the use of the house and the surrounding 52 acres for their lifetimes.  Mr. McShain died in 1989 and Mrs. McShain lived in the house until her death in 1998, when the use of the house reverted to the State, some 20 years after the sale.The house is now the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which manages Killarney National Park.  In the 2005-09 management plan for the park, the stated intention for Killarney House is to retain and preserve its integrity and character, both internally and externally, and to provide for visitor access to certain parts as appropriate, in particular the three main furnished reception rooms.  Detailed specialist surveys commissioned by the Office of Public Works have made clear the need for significant infrastructural works, such as adequate plumbing, heating and electrical systems, before the house can be opened to the public.  While Killarney House is, therefore, in need of repair before it can be opened as a fully functioning building to the general public, it is in a stable condition.  It has been used for meetings of the national park liaison committee and for meetings between the Department and the trustees of Muckross House.I assure the House that the Minister is committed to the development of Killarney House and the wider Killarney National Park, of which the house is an integral part.  In the past five years, more than €5.5 million has been invested in the park, some €2.5 million of which was spent last year.  A further €2 million will be invested this year.  In addition, more than €1.4 million was spent in the past few years by the OPW on the provision of universal access at Muckross House, which, for the first time, gives those with a mobility impairment full and equal access to the house.  Killarney House has also benefited from this investment.  Following consultations with the OPW, essential works to avoid any deterioration to the fabric of the building have been funded by the Department.  These works include the removal of plaster on the walls to prevent dampness, the provision of dehumidifiers in all the main rooms on the ground floor and other important trench and draining works.  The golden gates and railings of the house have been restored, a security system has been installed and heating pipes and radiators have been upgraded.  In 2007, the gate lodge at Killarney House was renovated for use as an assembly and information point for walking tours, at a cost of more than €250,000.  The lawns and flowerbeds at the house are regularly maintained.  Staff are employed to cut the lawns, trim hedges, plant and maintain flowerbeds, collect litter and carry out small maintenance jobs.  I emphasise that contrary to recent media reports, there are no squatters at Killarney House.I assure Deputies that the Minister is committed to ensuring that Killarney House fulfils its potential.  To that end, he has asked his Department to work closely with all the appropriate State agencies to explore funding options.  It will liaise with the Office of Public Works, in particular, to decide on a phased work programme for the house.

Indeed, I met with the Commission late last year and I indicated my broad approval for the preparation of the necessary legislative proposals in that regard.I hope to bring those proposals to the Government for approval shortly.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill is currently being drafted and I intend to publish it as soon as possible this year.  Because they provide property services, property management agents, together with auctioneers and estate agents, will be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority. The Authority is currently operating on a non-statutory basis but will be put on a statutory footing by the Bill.As regards property management companies, the position is that the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December 2006.  It identified a broad range of regulatory and other issues arising in relation to such developments, including problems relating to the structure and governance of property management companies and the manner in which company law currently applies to them.The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will publish, as soon as possible, its Report on Multi-Unit Developments which, following an extensive consultation process, will contain definitive reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies. The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the Commission's recommendations; the types of action to be taken will, of course, be dependent on the form that the recommendations take.A high-level interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, comprising representatives of relevant Departments and Offices has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in relation to multi-unit developments.  A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to the Commission's recommendations and to determine a timescale for their implementation.  This committee is reporting to a Cabinet Committee whose membership comprises the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Consideration of the issue of heroin misuse in Ireland needs to take place in the global context within which such misuse takes place.The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime estimates that 90% of the heroin which is consumed in the European Union originates from Afghanistan.  The sharp increase both in cultivation and production of illicit opium poppy in Afghanistan, which in 2007, recorded its highest level ever continues to result in an increasing supply of the drug being available right across the European Union, including in Ireland.  This development is reflected in the increasing level of seizures of the drugs which have been made by An Garda Síochána here in recent times.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána seized approximately 128 kg of the drug in 2006, 125 kg of the drug in 2007 and that approximately 49 kg of the drug has already been seized for this year for the period January 1 to February 13, inclusive.  I am advised that these statistics for 2007 and 2008 are provisional pending the publication of the Garda Annual Reports for the years in question.Undoubtedly these are very significant volumes of the drug which have been seized by An Garda Síochána.  In monetary terms this equates to heroin with a street value of approximately €60.5m being captured by the Gardaí and I warmly commend their ongoing work in this regard.I am advised by the Garda authorities that this increasing level of heroin seizures is as a result of ongoing and intelligence-led operations specifically targeting those suspected of involvement in the importation and distribution of illegal drugs and that these operations have led to a number of very significant arrests in recent times of those involved in the drugs trade.Of course this is an ongoing work in progress and the Government fully acknowledges that tackling the problem of drug trafficking remains an ongoing challenge to be faced with vigilance.In terms of resources, as the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  It is and must remain the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.The Garda National Drugs Unit is the primary unit within An Garda Síochána charged with responsibility for drug supply law enforcement.  As at 31 January 2008 the personnel strength of the Unit was 65.Since the publication of the Government's National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources in the fight against illicit drugs have increased.  This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.Both the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. Furthermore, all Gardaí are tasked with confronting drugs related issues as they arise.The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  This takes place against the background of the unprecedented expansion of An Garda Síochána which has taken and will continue to take place increasing the overall strength of the Gardaí to 16,000.  Additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time,  These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.Finally, I can assure the House that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking, including the trafficking of heroin, under review.  The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2008.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	438	While I recognise the good faith in this suggestion, I do not envisage being in a position to accede to it.  In particular, I am informed by the Minister for Finance, that in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of the Constitution, revenue accruing to the State, including revenue which has been accumulated as a result of drug trafficking, which is seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau, is paid into the Central Fund.  It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.  I am further informed that there are no proposals at present to alter these arrangements.With certain exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.A policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process and could have far-reaching implications.  The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public monies be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann unless otherwise provided by statute.To agree that revenues secured through the Criminal Assets Bureau be allocated for drug victims, for example, would mean that the treatment of drug victims would be financed, in part at least, by uncertain and variable revenue sources. Furthermore, if certain revenues which are variable were earmarked for particular projects within the overall fight against drug abuse, any projects thus funded would be dependent on actual revenue collected from that source.  To put it bluntly, this could mean that a fall in revenue generated by that source would lead to a fall in expenditure on such drug-related projects.The Government is already allocating very considerable resources to a wide range of Government Departments and State Agencies as well as to the Community and Voluntary treatment sectors to tackle the issue of drug misuse.  For example, in 2008 the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been allocated €64.3 million for the expenditure subhead Drugs Initiative/Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund.    The vast bulk of this funding is committed by the Government in developing a comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the drugs problem at local levels.I can assure the House that the Government remains firmly committed to the provision of significant funding to tackle the issue of drug misuse particularly in the areas where the problem is most acute.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The capital budget for the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of my Department, is €9 million in 2008.  This capital allocation is in respect of spending on the 4 children detention schools for which my Department assumed responsibility on 1 March of last year.  The allocation for 2008 is required to fund a range of projects across the 4 schools and to begin to fund the development of new children detention facilities for which planning is expected to commence shortly.  The Government's commitment to spending in this area is set out in the Programme for Government and the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 to 2013 both of which have identified the development of children detention facilities as a priority.  Exchequer and NDP funding of €144.8 million has been allocated over the period 2008-2012 and spending has been scheduled over this 5 year period.Work has progressed on a number of capital projects since 1 March 2007 and it is anticipated that the 2008 allocation will be spent in full with further projects due to start this year.  No project in the children detention schools has been put back or reduced in scale as a result of the budgetary process.In 2006 an Expert Group was appointed to make recommendations in relation to the development of the children detention schools.  The Group's first progress report was completed in December 2006 and the final report was submitted to my colleague, Brendan Smith T.D., Minister for Children, in December 2007.  The Minister has given careful consideration to the recommendations of that report and has brought proposals to Government recently.  I understand that the Expert Group's Report will be published shortly and my colleague will make an announcement on the matter in due course.In the last year, since my Department assumed responsibility, expenditure in the detention schools provided for improved facilities to all of the schools.  This will ensure the extended life and continued operation of the existing buildings pending plans for redevelopment.  The ongoing projects include the construction of a swimming pool to replace a derelict facility on the Oberstown campus and the upgrading of sanitary facilities at the Trinity House School building.

This initiative was permitted by a change in the law on the in camera rule in family law.  Dr. Carol Coulter was engaged to carry out the reporting of family law on a pilot basis.The Report comes in two parts. The first part deals with the reporting project itself and makes suggestions, primarily aimed at the Courts Service, for the future direction of the Family Law Reporting Project including that the project should continue.  Among the 18 recommendations made in the Report are:the Courts Service should decide if it is appropriate for it to provide a reporting service on family law, and if so, it should decide what such a service would consist of;whether the Regulations, naming those entitled to attend family law proceedings, could be amended to allow bona fide members of the press to attend;if the Courts Service decides to continue the project it should do so for another year — while progressing the digital recording of judgments;from 2009, or earlier if practicable, the Courts Service should publish judgments, decisions, statistics and some reports or sample cases on the Courts Service website;the Courts Service should consider nominating a representative to liaise with academic institutions on family law;the creation of a new Rule of Court to allow judges to give direction in court to those reporting family law proceedings, particularly on how to maintain litigants' anonymity; andthe Central Statistics Office should be asked to extend its examination of statistics in the Courts Service to family law.I welcome the establishment by the Courts Service of a Special Committee to oversee the Family Law Reporting Project for a further year and to consider the recommendations made in Dr Coulter's report with a view to making proposals for their implementation.  I understand that the Committee has commenced its work.

The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  There are currently 29 Committees in operation in a pilot phase to gain experience rolling the Committees out to all local authority areas in the State.  In general the outcome to date has been positive and the Committees are meeting definite local needs.Following on from a consultation seminar last November hosted by me and my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, work is underway on revising the guidelines under which the Committees operate, in the light of the experience gained to date.  Following consultation with my Ministerial colleagues, I intend to issue these revised guidelines to enable the roll out of the Committees to take place as soon as possible, which I envisage will be in the middle of this year.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for the extension of the children detention school model to all children under the age of 18 years who are ordered to be detained by the Courts.  An Expert Group on Children Detention Schools was tasked by the Minister for Children in 2006 to initiate and plan for the necessary redevelopment of existing children detention schools including the development of new facilities to accommodate the 16 to 17 year age group who are currently accommodated in St. Patrick's Institution and to advise accordingly.  The Expert Group's final report has been submitted to my colleague the Minister for Children in December 2007 and he has given consideration to the matter and will make an announcement shortly.The redevelopment of children detention school places will take time as it requires detailed planning, design and consultation with stakeholders to ensure that high quality facilities are created.  In the interim it is necessary to retain the use of St. Patrick's Institution until suitable children detention school places can be created with regard to 16 and 17 year old boys.As all prison accommodation on the Mountjoy site, including St. Patrick's Institution, is to be closed it is necessary to make provision for interim accommodation, should it be required, for 16 and 17 year old boys on the Thornton Hall campus.  The campus structure of Thornton Hall will ensure that a facility for 16 and 17 year old boys is segregated from facilities being used by adult offenders.  On completion of the detention school development project all children under 18 years of age being detained will only be accommodated in dedicated children facilities.  This is compatible with UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and as provided for in the Children Act 2001, as amended.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The dedicated multidisciplinary drug detoxification programme in the Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison involves both prison based staff and external agencies.  The aim of the Unit is to assist prisoners who have indicated a desire to move from either a situation of current drug use or existing substitution programme to drug free status.Participation is based on assessment of suitability for the programme.  Each programme lasts six weeks and can facilitate up to nine prisoners.  An essential element of this programme is that suitable arrangements are organised to ensure appropriate throughcare and follow-up of participants.  During 2007, a total of 56 prisoners participated in this programme.The detoxification programme is just one of the many drug rehabilitation programmes currently being offered in Irish prisons.  These programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.  These programmes involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.Finally, I should add that the capacity to deliver the Irish Prison Service's Drugs Policy and Strategy will be significantly enhanced by the provision of the new complex at Thornton Hall.

At a graduation ceremony to take place in the Garda College on Thursday 6th March, it is expected that approximately 60 more trainees will be attested.  The next intake of trainees will be on the weekend of 8th and 9th March.The 206 attested members currently operational are attached to the following Stations:DMR (Dublin Metropolitan Region) Stations — 101:DMR South Central Division — Pearse Street (20), Kevin Street (5), Kilmainham (3) and Donnybrook (6).DMR North Central Division — Store Street (9), Bridewell (6) and Fitzgibbon Street (6).DMR West Division — Clondalkin (2), Finglas (3), Lucan (3), Ballyfermot (3) and Blanchardstown (6).DMR North Division — Santry (1), Raheny (3), Swords (3), Clontarf (1), Coolock (3), Ballymun (2) and Balbriggan (2).DMR South Division — Crumlin (2), Sundrive Road (1), Rathmines (2) and Terenure (1).DMR East Division — Bray (2), Dun Laoghaire (3) and Blackrock (3).Stations outside DMR — 105:Mayfield (2), Gurranabraher (1), Midleton (4), Mitchelstown (1), Anglesea Street Cork (13), Togher (1), Sligo (5), Galway (12), Henry Street Limerick (9), Ennis (4), Tralee (1), Waterford (7), Tramore (2), Kilkenny (4), Wexford (3), New Ross (1), Gorey (1), Newbridge (1), Blessington (1), Naas (2), Carlow (2), Clonmel (2), Cahir (1), Carrick on Suir (1), Tipperary town (1), Cavan town (2), Monaghan town (1), Drogheda (4), Dundalk (3), Kells (1), Castlebar (4), Westport (1), Ballina (3), Mullingar (3) and Letterkenny (1).Recruitment is continuing and regular promotional efforts to attract potential Reserve members are being undertaken.  Garda Reserve members undertake their training and other duties on a voluntary basis during their free time.  As a result it is not possible to predict how many people will commence training in any particular month.I cannot predict exactly when the full complement of Garda Reserve members will be reached but I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána have advised that they are making every effort to reach it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I presume the Deputy is referring to remarks attributed to the Minister for Integration which were reported in the media in January of this year.I should point out at the outset, that notwithstanding the lower number of applications in recent years, significant levels of abuse continue in our asylum process.  In the region of 90% of asylum applications are determined to be unfounded after the exhaustion of all possible appeals.  I say this to remind the Deputy that we can never become complacent about ensuring the integrity of our asylum processes and to demonstrate that there will always be individuals who will cynically seek to exploit the system in a way that distracts our attention from the needs of the genuine asylum seeker.It is against this background that the current level of Judicial Reviews is a genuine cause for concern.  In my view, it is clearly evident that many people use the Judicial Review process simply in order to prolong their stay in the State.  As the Deputy is probably aware, delays in finalising cases in the asylum area can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where such a course of action is pursued.   However, it is a reality that the large scale of Judicial Reviews currently taken does contribute to significant delays in the processing regime.It is important that the refugee status determination process in Ireland is not seen as being any less robust, when compared to that in other countries, by those who would wish to use it as a means to enter Ireland outside of the normal immigration channels.  Delays in the process, however they are caused, could lead to such a view being formed. I understand that a small group of legal firms are responsible for a significant percentage of judicial reviews lodged in the asylum area and that many of the statements of grounds of these judicial reviews are of a generalised or non-specific nature.  The understandable concern in relation to many of these cases is that legal action is being pursued with the primary intention of frustrating the determination process and delaying the finalisation of the processing of applications where the decision would almost certainly be that the applicants are not in fact in need of protection in Ireland.The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill (which recently passed Second Stage in this House) comprehensively reforms and simplifies the current system through the introduction of a single procedure for the investigation of all grounds including protection ones put forward by applicants for protection.  This reform of the processing framework will lead to the removal of the existing multi-layered and sequential process and will allow an applicant to get a final decision on their application in a more timely and efficient fashion.  Along with other provisions in the Bill, this reform is intended to reduce the time taken to process each case to finality which is in the interests of the applicant and the protection of the integrity of the application process.In conclusion, I have no difficulty in discussing these issues with the Bar Council and the Law Society and it is my intention to do so.

Investigations into many of these cases are ongoing and, accordingly, the number of cases where prosecutions are initiated can be expected to rise.  I have outlined to the House previously difficulties which can arise in detecting gangland killings and the extensive efforts being made by An Garda Síochána to overcome these.YearRecordedDetectedProceedings CommencedConvictions200830002007185202006267522005225222004985420032011422002116542001952220001276219991277519984321Figures for 2007 and 2008 are provisional, operational and liable to change.

This report, with no material excluded, was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 21 December, 2007.The Deputy will be aware that the Designated Judge's oversight function and the ensuing reports to the Taoiseach, pursuant to Section 8 of the 1993 Act and Section 67 of the 2005 Act, provide an important public safeguard in relation to the State's lawful interception and telecommunications data access arrangements.  In particular, these reports set out the findings of the Designated Judge's ongoing review of the operation of both the 1993 Act and Part 7 of the 2005 Act, including whether the Garda Síochána and the Permanent Defence Force are complying with their provisions.I am pleased to note that in his most recent report, the Designated Judge expressed satisfaction that the provisions of both statutes are being complied with, after having inspected and checked the records maintained by the Garda Síochána, the Permanant Defence Force and my Department and after having received a satisfactory explanation to such queries as he raised.  I welcome this finding, as I do the similar, previous findings of earlier reports of the Designated Judge.In relation to reports by the Complaints Referee pursuant to Section 9 of the 1993 Act, such reporting provides a further safeguard in relation to the State's lawful interception arrangements by forming part of an independent complaints procedure for members of the public who believe that a communication sent to or by them has been intercepted.  I am pleased to note that, to date, no such report has been received by the Taoiseach, which indicates that the Complaints Referee has, to date, never concluded, upon investigation of a complaint, that there has been a contravention of the relevant provisions of the 1993 Act.

Section 6(1) of the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Act 1941 obliges me, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to refuse to authorise an application for compensation to the High Court where I am of opinion that the injury is of a minor character and was sustained in the performance of a duty not involving special risk.  This assessment is discharged by my staff and is informed by medical reports and previous Court judgments in Garda Compensation Act cases.The numbers of Garda compensation claims received for the years 2003 to 2007 are set out in the table below:Claims per year20072006200520042003Received198257249194270During that period I authorised 771 cases and I refused 299. It is my practice never to refuse a case on the grounds that it is minor without giving the applicant a further opportunity to make representations.  The number of compensation claims that are currently outstanding is 1,245.I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government in the near future with the objective of establishing a Garda Compensation Tribunal which will deal with both minor and non minor injuries.

In the intervening time period, a cross referencing operation was undertaken which matched the data held by my Department with those records held by the Irish Prison Service.  As a result of this exercise, I am now in a position to provide the Deputy with the information he requested.The number of all non-Irish citizens released from prison and subsequently deported during the period from 1 February 2007 until 30 November 2007, including their nationalities, is as follows:Month and YearNationalityNumber of persons deported3 April 2007Canadian16 June 2007Moldovan7 June 2007Kosovan112 June 2007Chinese128 July 2007Georgian17 August 2007Chinese13 September 2007Australian16 September 2007Chinese1Total8My officials will undertake another cross referencing operation, matching data held by my Department with those records held by the Irish Prison Service in order to bring the statistics supplied up to the end of February 2008.  I can assure the Deputy that the updated statistics will be conveyed to him at the earliest possible date.My Department's policy — and indeed the accepted international practice — is that persons found not to have protection needs and no right to remain in the State, should be returned promptly to their home countries in order to protect the integrity of the asylum and immigration processes.  To do otherwise would result in Ireland becoming a magnet for unfounded and abusive asylum claims, the consequence of which would be to undermine the immigration laws of the State and to make big demands on the Exchequer.

I have nothing further to add to the details set out in that reply.

The 29 Joint Policing Committees currently established in a pilot phase operate under revised guidelines issued by my predecessor in May 2007.  The purpose of the pilot phase is to gain experience from the operation of a number of Committees in a variety of local authority areas before rolling them out to all local authority areas in the State.Following consultations with my colleagues the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I intend to issue, as soon as possible, revised guidelines to enable roll-out of the committees to all local authority areas in the State.   The guidelines will provide inter alia a timetable for this roll-out.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the retention of data was due to be transposed by 15 September 2007.  Under Article 249 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), Member States of the European Union as well as members of the European Economic Area (EEA) are bound to transpose such Directives.  Failure to do so could result in the Commission bringing Ireland before the Court of Justice.  The Irish challenge to the Directive to the European Court of Justice, which is grounded on the proper legal base for the instrument, does not excuse us from transposing the Directive.  The Directive will ensure a high level of harmonisation of the laws governing the retention of data in the countries of the EU and EEA, which is essential in the fight against international organised crime, including terrorist crime.Consultations have taken place with interest groups and further consultations are planned.  I am at present finalising my proposals for implementing the Directive.  These includes the periods of retention for the categories of data to be retained and the method of transposition, the two areas where we have some flexibility.  The usual method of transposition for this class of Directive is by means of a Statutory Instrument.I am aware of the views of the Data Protection Commissioner on the requirement to retain data and officials from my Department will be in touch with him again to discuss my proposals when they are finalised.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As of 31 January 2008 the personnel strength of Limerick Garda Division and Tallaght Garda Station was 592 and 180 respectively.  The number of Community Gardaí assigned to the Limerick Garda Division and Tallaght Garda Station on 31 December, 2007 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 66 and 24, respectively.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  All Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.There is one Garda Station in Tallaght and there are 34 Garda Stations in the Limerick Garda Division which covers both the urban and rural areas.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  In doing this he takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime rates and trends as well as operational priorities.  The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí is due to take place on 13 March next.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda Stations and Divisions referred to will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 168 together.I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda Information System which includes PULSE is functioning very satisfactorily.  Significant investment has been made to improve availability and response times and I am advised that as a result, since the beginning of 2007, there has been virtually no unplanned downtime.  The PULSE system is more widely available than ever before, with access by both Garda and civilian personnel to over 2000 personal computers in 338 locations, including every Divisional and District Headquarters.  The Deputies will be aware that the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), which is based in Castlebar, allows Gardaí, who would otherwise have to return to their station to input or update incident data, to log the information over the telephone with the GISC, thus releasing Garda resources for visible, frontline policing across our communities.The functionality of the PULSE system is continually upgraded and enhanced to accommodate new business requirements, policies and procedures as well as updates to reflect new legislation.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that functionality in relation to the prosecution of limited companies will be provided in the next release of the system, which is scheduled to be deployed by mid-year.  This new functionality will replace the current manual process used by the Garda Síochána to prosecute limited companies.The original estimated budget for PULSE back in 1993 was in the region of €46.4m (£36.5m Punts).  The system was developed over a number of phases and an number of additional items arose over the course of the project such as the need for additional external resources, costs associated with the Year 2000 and the provision of backup facilities.  These additional items brought the total development cost of the system by 2001 to €61.3m.  The Garda authorities advise that the average annual maintenance and upgrade costs for PULSE from 2001 to the end of 2006 amounted to €12.88m.  This expenditure includes the cost of contract resources, replacement of hardware, software upgrades and software licence fees.  Following the completion of a comprehensive stabilisation programme and hardware upgrade for the PULSE system in 2006, PULSE was amalgamated with other systems including the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) to form a new combined IT system referred to as the Garda Information System (GIS).  Accordingly, since the start of 2007, specific figures relating to expenditure on PULSE are not available.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 121, 159 and 516 together.A tender process for procuring an outsourced safety camera network  is under way.  During this process issues arose because it emerged that costs involved would be substantially higher than had been estimated when the matter was considered by Government previously, which necessitated a further examination of the matter by the Government.  The Government has confirmed that it will be proceeding with the outsourcing of a countrywide safety camera network and the financial resources necessary to do so will be provided.  The tender process is at an advanced stage, and it is expected that contract negotiations with the preferred bidder will commence shortly.  I am not in a position to indicate at this time the cost of the project as the tender process is not complete.Enforcement of road traffic law is one of the highest priorities of An Garda Síochána.  They are continuing to focus their enforcement activity on the main causes of road deaths and serious injuries — speeding, drink driving and the non-wearing of seatbelts and also on road transport offences.  The financial resources allocated to traffic related duties increased from €3.7 million in 2007 to €11 million in  this year's Estimates, in addition to the amount which will be allocated for the safety camera network.  An Garda Síochána were recently authorised to replace the GATSO systems currently operating with eight new state of the art mobile speed cameras. These will be operational not later than June.  This will take place against the background of an increase in the Garda Traffic Corps of 170 this year and 225 last year, bringing the strength of the Corps to 1,200 by end of the year.In addition, approval has also been given for the Gardaí to acquire an Automated Number Plate Recognition System for up to 100 Garda vehicles, which among many features, will have a speed detection capability.  Gardaí will also continue to use over 400 hand held detection devices available to them.Saving lives through  making our roads safer, including through taking effective, efficient and targeted measures to reduce speeding, in line with the Road Safety Strategy will remain an absolute priority for me and the Government.

The development  procedure is set out in Part 4 of the Prisons Act, 2007.  I am pleased to advise the House that the Notice of Development and Environmental Impact Assessment in respect of the project was published on Friday 29 February 2008.  A copy of the Notice of Development has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.The publication of the Environmental Impact Assessment affords all interested parties an opportunity to make their views known and have them fully considered prior to a decision to proceed with the development.  It is intended, subject to the statutory planning phase and the successful conclusion of the contract negotiations, to commence construction later this year.  It is envisaged that the development will take approximately three years to complete.Due to commercial and procurement reasons,  it is not possible to provide details as to the likely costs of the construction and fit out costs.  The disclosure of such information is not allowed under Department of Finance PPP guidelines.I can, however, confirm the following expenditure which has taken place to date on the project.  The cost of the site acquisition was €29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison project.  In addition to allaying these concerns, the new roadway will provide significant additional benefits both during the construction and operational phases of the project.  The cost of this additional land was €1,305,000.A total of €5,634,367 has been expended to date on preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security and maintenance of the property, archaeological and topographical, etc., and professional fees including legal and specialist technical advice.Expenditure to date on the project has amounted to a total of €36,839,367, including site acquisition costs.

With effect from the 25 January 2005, new arrangements for the speedier processing of applications from certain countries were implemented.  These arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Croatia and South Africa.  They also applied to Romania and Bulgaria prior to their accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.The Office of the Refugee Applications CommissionerIn terms of the average timescales to process Prioritised cases at first instance, an interview date is usually scheduled within 9-12 working days from the date of the initial application.  These applications are normally finalised within a further 5-8 working days, giving an average processing time of 17-20 working days from the date of application.In the case of  Non-prioritised cases, an interview date is usually scheduled approximately 16-18 weeks from the date of the initial application.  These applications are normally finalised within a further 4-5 weeks, giving a total processing time of 20-23 weeks from the date of application.Some cases will take significantly longer to complete, for example, due to medical reasons, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  Some cases are also more complex than others with applicants coming from over 90 different countries.ORAC continues to schedule applicants for interview on the date of application unless there are medical or other compelling reasons.The Refugee Applications Commissioner continues to keep the procedure for processing applications for refugee status in that Office under ongoing review with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation to be made, without compromising on applicants rights to a fair and balanced examination of their case.The Refugee Appeals TribunalThe average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Substantive appeals is 21 weeks.The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Accelerated appeals (appeals on papers only) is 8 weeks.The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete appeals for Prioritised cases is 9 weeks.While many appeals are completed in a shorter time span than above, many factors such as adjournments, postponements, judicial reviews and requests by legal representatives for access to previous Tribunal decisions can impede the Tribunal from completing cases earlier.  High quality, consistent and fair decision making in all cases continues to be a high priority in the Tribunal.Improvements in Processing TimescalesThe Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner has made significant progress in the processing of asylum applications since the creation of the office in November 2000.In November 2000, when the ORAC was established, there were over 9,400 applications awaiting decision at first instance.  As at 31st January 2008, there were 1,272 outstanding applications awaiting a recommendation by ORAC.  Of these, only 171 cases were on hands over 6 months.The RAT has also made significant progress in the processing of asylum applications since the creation of the office in November 2000.  Prior to the establishment of the RAT, substantive appeals took, on average, 36 weeks to complete.  As already indicated, the average processing timescale for substantive cases is 21 weeks and 9 weeks for prioritised cases.As at 31st January 2008, there were 3,221 appeals outstanding in the Tribunal.  Of these 3,221 outstanding appeals, 2,007 were on hands over six months.  A large volume of the appeals outstanding more than 6 months in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is due to the delay in processing appeals pending the granting of access to Tribunal Decisions following the Supreme Court judgement (in the Atanasov case) on the matter.  Following the judgement the RAT set up a comprehensive data bank of previous decisions of the Tribunal, suitably redacted, which is readily available for access by legal representatives of applicants.  This data bank, along with other measures being applied by RAT, will be of considerable assistance in clearing the current backlog of cases.

Section 41 specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda Síochána, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The offence applies to the intimidation of witnesses, jurors or potential jurors or any member of these persons' families.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.Statutory provisions are also in place to ensure the admissibility of witness statements in circumstances where a witness seeks to resile from a statement already provided to the Garda Síochána in the course of an investigation.  Section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that a statement relevant to court proceedings may be admitted as evidence even if the witness, although available for cross-examination, refuses to give evidence or denies making a statement.  It is a matter for the court of trial to decide if such a statement is to be admitted as evidence.Since 1997, the Garda Síochána has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by complementary legislative provisions in Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 40 makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.As it is, the Garda Síochána already rigorously enforces the provisions relating to witness intimidation and protection contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  In particular, where the possibility of intimidation of witnesses may be an issue, the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has the discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.  Any such incident would also be the subject of a thorough investigation by the Garda Síochána with a view to seeking directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of proceedings commenced in respect of the offence created pursuant to Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the years 2003 to 2007 are as follows:YearProceedings Commenced200330200430200522200642200712*(*Provisional figure only and subject to change).

In addition 1,310 student Gardaí were at various stages of their training on that date, making a total of 15,042.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to assign members of the Force throughout the country and to national units.  In doing this he takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime rates and trends as well as operational priorities.  In that regard, specific operational needs will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of policing needs throughout the country.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Following the completion of a pilot Digital Radio project by the Garda authorities, a decision was taken to procure a single nationwide digital radio service for use by the Garda authorities, other emergency services and non-commercial State bodies.  This enables economies of scale as well as allowing for inter-agency communication in the event of major incidents or cross agency operations.  Following completion of the tender processes by the Department of Finance a preferred bidder, TETRA Ireland Ltd, was selected.  In order to ensure that the preferred bidder demonstrate its capability to deliver this key service for the emergency services, both from a technical and organisational perspective, a service performance evaluation covering a significant part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region and surrounds including Dublin Port and the Airport was carried out and completed late last year.In parallel with the performance evaluation, detailed and intensive contract negotiations have been taking place between the Department of Finance and the preferred bidder and I understand these negotiations are nearing completion.  I am also advised that preparation and planning by the Garda authorities is well advanced and implementation will closely follow the rollout of the infrastructure by the preferred bidder.  The entire nationwide rollout is expected to be completed over a 2 year period.I might add that the Garda authorities continue to maintain its existing radio infrastructure including the digital radio system servicing significant parts of the Dublin Metropolitan Region and its analogue systems throughout the country.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The information supplied in Parliamentary Question 324 of 20 February, 2008 was provided in answer to a specific question relating to prosecutions commenced, between 2003 and 2007, for an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, and is not inclusive of prosecutions commenced in respect of any other offences relating to the sale of alcohol to minors.Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics on the overall number of prosecutions commenced relating to the sale of alcohol to minors, for the years 2003 to 2007 and to date in 2008, directly to him.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The security of cash in transit deliveries is an issue the Government takes extremely seriously.  A number of measures have been adopted in recent years to improve security in this area.The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on Garda Síochána operational plans to prevent attacks on cash-in-transit deliveries.Nevertheless, I can say that there are a range of measures in place to combat the threat.  The Private Security Authority has commenced licensing of companies engaged in cash-in-transit.  The licensing regime put in place incorporates security measures as set out by the relevant branch of the Garda Síochána.  Furthermore, there are regular and ongoing discussions between the Gardaí and cash-in-transit industry stakeholders to ensure continued security of deliveries of cash.  The Deputy will be aware of a number of cases where attempted robberies from cash-in-transit deliveries were foiled.The Deputy will appreciate that decisions on the level of security provided for cash-in-transit vehicles are made by the Gardaí having taken all material facts into consideration.  Where it is judged to be appropriate, the assistance of the Army is sought for a particular cash consignment.  Recovery of the costs of such escorts is the subject of agreements between the Government and the Irish Banking Federation.I am satisfied that sufficient resources are available to the Garda Síochána in their ongoing efforts to combat the criminal threat to cash movements.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Reform and Consolidation of the Courts Acts in 2007 as a follow up to a project it began in 2005 which aimed to reform and consolidate the Courts Acts, which comprise up to 100 Acts, including a large number that predate the foundation of the State.  The Commission embarked on the project jointly with my Department and the Courts Service.  A Working Group was established for the project, comprising representatives of the Commission, the Courts Service, the judiciary, the Department, the legal profession and the academic community.  It is intended that a draft Courts Bill will be published as part of the final report of the Commission.On 13 February last, my Department, in consultation with the Commission, invited tenders from suitably qualified parties to draft the Bill.  The text of the Request for Tender document includes conditions, based on standard procurement practice, with which companies must comply in the event that they submit a tender.  There is, however, no requirement that the tenderer must be a company.  The Request for Tender document is currently displayed on the etenders website (www.etenders.gov.ie).  Further information in relation to the terms of reference, general conditions of the tender invitation, etc. is available on-line in that document and queries may be raised by any interested party.The drafting process will be carried out under the supervision of the Law Reform Commission.The Deputy will appreciate that the estimated cost of the project cannot be disclosed during the ongoing open competitive tender process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	472	Diversion of young people from crime and the criminal justice system is one of the responsibilities of my Department in accordance with the provisions of the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The causes of delinquent, anti-social, and criminal behaviour are often complex and may cover a range of issues which are dealt with by a number of Government Departments.  While my Department has not carried out specific research in the area referred to, I can say that a quantity of research exists which identifies educational disadvantage, along with other factors including poverty, unemployment, early school leaving, addiction and inadequate parenting, as contributing to juvenile delinquency.  It is generally accepted that all these factors can contribute to young people becoming involved in anti-social behaviour and delinquency.The Government has invested heavily in tackling educational and social disadvantage over many years and across a range of Government Departments and Agencies.  In my own Department, for example, the Government agreed a comprehensive programme to implement youth justice reforms including the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  As well as providing strategic leadership, the IYJS works on a partnership basis with Government Departments and Agencies to reduce youth offending.  It funds organisations providing services (including Garda and Probation Service projects) to young people who find themselves in conflict with the law.  Its main responsibilities include a remit to develop a unified youth justice policy and to devise a national strategy to deliver this policy and service.  In developing its national youth justice strategy, which will cover the period 2008-2010, the issue of educational disadvantage and juvenile delinquency is one of those identified.  The strategy will set out the role which various Government Departments and State Agencies will play in reducing youth offending.The strategy will be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Children.  In rolling out the strategy, the objective of the IYJS and relevant Departments and Agencies will be to make existing intervention measures more effective and develop new policies and programmes as appropriate, with the aim of reducing youth offending and diverting young people from such behaviour.  The primary goal will be to keep children who offend out of detention by using alternatives to prosecution including referral, where appropriate, to Garda Youth Diversion projects, the Garda Juvenile Diversion programme, community sanctions and restorative justice.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are being targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated.  Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted through the use of intelligence-led operations primarily undertaken by  specialised units of An Garda Síochána such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drug Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition, information relating to these groupings is disseminated on a regular basis to Europol at The Hague.An Garda Síochána maintains liaison with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe, and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish criminals living abroad.  This ongoing liaison has led to a number of successful joint operations, targeting the attempted importation of drugs and firearms and has resulted in a number of significant arrests here and in other jurisdictions.  Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, to prevent and detect such criminality.Where information exists that a person, who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction, is living abroad and where the particular legal requirements apply extradition is sought or an application is made for a European Arrest Warrant.Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crimes.  A member of An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.An Garda Síochána will continue to be proactive in the use and further development of links with other foreign law enforcement agencies to ensure that a comprehensive and coordinated approach is applied to the problem of Irish criminals resident abroad.  In this respect, there already exist a number of bilateral agreements with foreign jurisdictions concerning serious and organised crime which facilitate greater cooperation and permit the exchange of staff and the transfer of expertise between the parties to these agreements.The ongoing activities and successes of the Criminal Assets Bureau, in cooperation with similar agencies in other jurisdictions, also ensures that this type of criminality is being tackled, regardless of the location of the criminal concerned.

Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss other treatment options with healthcare staff, which may include methadone maintenance.The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has spaces specifically allocated for a dedicated drug detoxification programme.  Each multidisciplinary programme lasts 6 weeks and the programme has a capacity of 9 prisoners at a time.Prisoners who present, either on committal or otherwise, with other substance misuse related problems have available to them a range of medical, nursing, psychological, and counselling services which are tailored to the particular needs of their situation.Finally, I should add that the capacity to deliver the Irish Prison Service's Drugs Policy and Strategy will be significantly enhanced by the provision of the new complex at Thornton Hall.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the approximate quantities of heroin, cocaine, cannabis and other main illegal drugs seized in 2007*:Drug TypeQuantityStreet Value€Heroin125.2 Kgs24,920,000Cannabis Resin1.7 Tonne12,416,000Cannabis Herb1.76 Tonne3,676,000Ecstasy Tables360,279 tablets3,602,000*Cocaine1.7 tonne119,480,000Amphetamine34 kgs510,000Total164,604,000*The figures provided for 2007 are operational, provisional and may change.In terms of estimating the proportion of drug seizures made in this jurisdiction by our law enforcement authorities in relation to the overall volumes of drugs being trafficked, obviously given the clandestine nature of this illegal activity this is extremely difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty and is therefore speculative.However to assist the Deputy, what can be said in this regard though is that the global illicit drug trade is, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), reputed to exceed billions of US$ annually.That UN office estimated in 2005 that global seizures for that year accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production, 7% of amphetamines and 4.7% of ecstasy.As I am sure the Deputy appreciates, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally.  Our drug law enforcement response is of course a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our current National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.   The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Pat Carey, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and has recently begun the process of developing our new Strategy for the years 2009-2016.This work will involve a wide ranging consultative process, in which my Department will actively participate, which will fully inform the development of our new Strategy.My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.An Garda Síochána invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state.Conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade.Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.This work is ongoing and An Garda Síochána will continue to pursue these strategies and continue to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking primarily through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.To further assist in our law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking, a number of new initiatives have been recently introduced.Some examples of this includes the following:The establishment in January 2008 of the Organised Crime Unit onto a permanent footing with full time staff assigned to it.  The Unit now has a personnel strength of 70 and, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardaí, will continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.The recently established Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N) in Lisbon, of which Ireland is a founding member.  The Centre has the specific objective of intercepting narcotic shipments, in particular cocaine, to the European Union from Latin America.A number of provisions introduced in  the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 have provided for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking under review.  The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2008.

The implementation of the Strategy is the agreed focus of disability policy under the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.Under the terms of Towards 2016, the National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group was established in December, 2006 to monitor progress on the overall implementation of the National Disability Strategy.  The Group comprises representatives of stakeholder groups, senior officials and the National Disability Authority, while my Department also serves as Secretariat to the Group.  The Group received a third report on the National Disability Strategy by senior officials of the relevant Government Departments in January, 2008.  The reports provided to date have been presented to Dr. Jimmy Devins, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and Mental Health and they have been presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.  The three reports to date were not prepared on the basis that they would be published.Under the provisions of the Disability Act, 2005, six Government Departments prepared Sectoral Plans in key sectors including transport, built infrastructure, housing, training and employment, health and social welfare provision.  The Sectoral Plans were presented to the Oireachtas and they were published in December, 2006.  The Departments have provided targets and costings for the implementation of the Sectoral Plans and have established separate fora with stakeholder representatives to monitor progress on the implementation of the plans.

Of course, while JLOs are specifically dedicated to this service, a significant number of Gardaí are also engaged in liaising with juveniles on a day-to-day basis.  As for the deployment of Garda resources generally, I am assured that Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed by Garda management.  This is to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.The Garda Diversion Programme is an initiative, first introduced in 1963, to provide an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity.  The programme provides that if certain criteria are met, a juvenile offender under 18 years of age may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.  It enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Programme and aim to divert young people away from crime and anti social behaviour.  There are currently 100 of these type of projects operating throughout the country and this number will be extended to 168 in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.  Additional resources have been allocated to fund the further expansion of these projects with total funding set at €11.909 million for 2008.

I referred the report to the Attorney General for advice in relation to its publication.  His advice was that there were legal impediments to publication of the full report.However, he also advised that more limited forms of disclosure were possible and I have acted on the basis of that advice.  I made a copy of the full report available, subject to conditions of confidentiality, to the Cork city Coroner, who is conducting an inquest at present, and to those members of the Garda Síochána whose conduct was the subject of investigation under the terms of Mr Hartnett's warrant of appointment.  In addition I have made voluntary discovery of the full report to the family's legal representatives within the context of ongoing legal proceedings.  I also gave a copy of the full report to the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions.In so far as wider publication is concerned, I am in the process of preparing a summary of the report which I intend to publish shortly.  The summary will include all of the report's findings and conclusions on each item of Mr Hartnett's terms of reference together with comprehensive information on the reasons for those findings.

Approval to proceed with a nationwide system has been conveyed and the Garda authorities will shortly hold a tender competition for the supply of the system.  The primary focus of the system will be to check against watch lists that relate directly to the vehicle through its number-plate.   Accordingly, to ensure maximum efficiency of the system, it is planned that the system will concentrate on checks against databases of stolen and untaxed vehicles and other vehicles brought to the attention of the Gardaí.With regard to the extent to which the system could be used to check for no insurance or driver licences, I am advised that this would depend on the potential development of databases linking vehicles with licences and insurance.  I am, however, advised that the proposed ANPR system could be used for this purpose if such databases could be developed.

The exhumation took place on 28 November, 2007 and a post-mortem examination was conducted by the State Pathologist.I am informed that samples of bone were forwarded to the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, for DNA analysis and comparison on 29 November, 2007.  Following this work the body remains unidentified.  Details of the DNA profile have been requested for provision to the Forensic Science Laboratory for comparison with existing and future DNA profiles obtained of missing persons or their relatives.

I expect that a Memorandum containing detailed proposals in this regard will be submitted to Government in the near future.The Immigration Residents and Protection Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, will assist An Garda Síochána in its enforcement role regarding immigration legislation and the removal of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers. The Bill restates many of the existing legislative provisions dealing with border control and, in certain circumstances, updates those provisions to take account of experience gained and advances in technology etc.  In particular, the Bill provides a legislative basis for the greater use of biometric information, for identification purposes, at a number of stages in the immigration process including border control at ports of entry.   In addition, I have also signalled my intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to allow for the making of regulations requiring information to be provided by carriers, before departure for the State, in respect of specified intended arrivals.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 177, 179 and 461 together.Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the most recent figures available show that from 1 January, 2007 to 31 January, 2008 480 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 145 to children. There have been 6 formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, made.There were three applications by An Garda Síochána to the courts — two for a civil order (adult) and one for a behaviour order (child).  Two applications remain before the courts, and one application was unsuccessful.During this period the Wexford/Wicklow Garda Division, which includes County Wicklow, issued no behaviour warnings to adults or children.I am further informed that between 1 October, 2007 and 31 January, 2008 214 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 65 to children. There were 4 formal good behaviour contracts made during this period.Between 1 January, 2007 and 28 February, 2007 8 behaviour warnings were issued to adults. From 1 January to 31 January, 2008 (the latest date for which figures are available) 35 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 14 to children. There were 2 formal good behaviour contracts made during this period.

The Department was assured by the production company that next of kin had been contacted in those instances where individual cases featured, in light of the sensitive nature of the material.  In one such instance, and shortly before broadcast, one of the families in question did contact the Department expressing dissatisfaction with the extent to which their concerns had been taken on board by the production company.  Our understanding is that there was further subsequent interaction between the company and the family in question with a view to resolving those concerns, but the Department was not a party to those discussions.While I am not aware that other families were similarly dissatisfied, the Department would very much regret if this was the case.  For the sake of completeness, I should add that the decision to facilitate the programme makers in the instant case with access to the State Pathologist was taken some years ago.  I do not envisage a programme of this character being facilitated in future.

In that context, section 80(2) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 obliges the Ombudsman Commission to submit a report to me on its effectiveness and on the adequacy of the functions assigned to it within two years of its establishment.  I am in receipt of an e-mail copy of that report and I understand that printed copies will be delivered to me shortly.  Copies of those reports will in due course be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.The report is being examined by my officials at present. However I am aware from ongoing contact with the Ombudsman Commission that they are of the view that certain amendments to the Act of 2005 would facilitate a better utilisation of resources.  I intend to bring proposals for suitable legislative changes to Government in the near future.Finally, I should say that I have secured authorisation for a total of 40 investigative posts for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and a recruitment process in relation to the outstanding vacancies for those specialised positions is currently in train.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	488	Drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally and the Government is fully aware of, and does not in any sense, underestimate the nature and extent of the problem of drugs which we experience in this State.The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our current National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.Our drug law enforcement response is of course a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Pat Carey, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and has recently begun the process of developing our new Strategy for the years 2009-2016.As Minister, as well as in my capacity as public representative, I am well aware of the challenges which tackling the trade in drugs poses for An Garda Síochána.Specifically, in terms of resources, as the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner. It is and must remain the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.The Garda National Drugs Unit is the primary unit within An Garda Síochána charged with responsibility for drug supply law enforcement. As at 31 January 2008 the personnel strength of the Unit was 65.Since the publication of the Government's National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources in the fight against illicit drugs have increased. This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.  The total strength of the Divisional Drug Units at the beginning of the year was 314.Both the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  Furthermore, all Gardaí are tasked with confronting drugs related issues as they arise.The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.This takes place against the background of the unprecedented expansion of An Garda Síochána which has taken and will continue to take place.Additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time.  These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking under review.The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2008.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	489	As the House is aware, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, prohibits possession in a public place of knives or any other articles which have a blade or are sharply pointed or any article made or adapted to cause injury.  Any person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or both.  Possession in a public place of any article intended to cause injury to, incapacitate or intimidate a person is also an offence and carries a sentence on indictment of a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  The same penalties also apply where a person in the course of a dispute or fight produces any article capable of inflicting serious injury.As I indicated recently, at my request, the Garda Commissioner undertook to review the current legislation pertaining to offensive weapons.  I understand that this review will be finished shortly and I will fully consider any proposals it may contain.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	490	As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have asked the Government Alcohol Advisory Group to examine the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol and to report to me by 31 March. Among the key issues being examined by the Group is the adequacy and effectiveness of existing sanctions and penalties, particularly those relating to the sale and supply of alcohol to, and alcohol consumption by, under-age persons.I look forward to receiving the Group's Report, and their recommendation on how best to proceed in this and related matters, by the 31 March deadline.  I intend then to bring forward urgent proposals for legislative reforms which, with the assistance of both Houses, will be enacted and implemented before the Summer recess.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	491	In December 2005, the Government agreed to put in place a series of reforms for the youth justice system.   These reforms concerned all aspects of youth justice, and included the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  The principal reform in relation to juvenile detention was the transfer of responsibility for the children detention schools to the IYJS, an executive office of my Department, following an amendment to the Children Act, 2001.  Another key reform was the extension of the children detention school model to all children being detained.  The Government also agreed to the establishment of an Expert Group on Children Detention Schools to begin planning for the redevelopment of detention school services.I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made in recent years.  The IYJS was established in December 2005.  The Children Act 2001, as amended, has been fully commenced and the transfer of the children detention schools from the Department of Education and Science to the operational remit of the Irish Youth Justice Service has been completed.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has a remit which addresses all aspects of youth justice including Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects, detention services and general youth justice policy.Since 1 March 2007, 16 and 17 year old girls, who would previously have  been detained in the prison system, are now only accommodated in Oberstown Girls School.  With regard to 16 and 17 year old boys, planning is underway to accommodate this group in children detention schools and my colleague, Mr. Brendan Smith, T.D. Minister for Children, will soon publish a report of the Expert Group on Children Detention and make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks.

While I, of course, offer appropriate assistance in that regard records are not maintained which would enable me to provide the precise information sought by the Deputy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I am informed by the Garda authorities that a dedicated firearms training range has been installed at the Garda College, Templemore and that a second similar range is being installed at a Dublin location and will be operational by April 2008.  These prefabricated modular firearms ranges facilitate live fire shooting in a carefully contained indoor environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.In addition, the Garda Síochána has two mobile firearms automated training systems for use at locations throughout the country and also has access to a total of nine Army firearms ranges around the country for the purpose of live firearms training.

This substantial extension of the Laboratory's capacity takes into account the findings of the Review referred to by the Deputy as to current demands on the organisation, as well as the need to plan for the implementation of the proposed DNA database.  The question of the resources required to operate the database once established, which was also examined in the Review, and to which the Deputy may be referring, will of course be addressed further as the project is developed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I am aware of the procedures in place for judicial appointments in the United Kingdom.  As the Deputy will be aware, in this jurisdiction the position is that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Its purpose is to identify persons and inform the Government of the suitability of those persons for judicial office.The Board consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, nominated representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Section 16 of the Act provides that the Government, when advising the President in relation to the appointment of a person to a judicial office, must first consider persons who have been recommended by the Board.  It is important to note that the Board cannot submit nor recommend the name of a person unless that person meets the eligibility requirements set out by law in relation to the post in question.  Furthermore, the Board cannot recommend the name of any person unless in the opinion of the Board the person concerned:has displayed in his/her practice as a solicitor or barrister a degree of competence and a degree of probity appropriate to and consistent with the appointment concerned,is suitable on grounds of character and temperament,is otherwise suitable,andcomplies with section 19 of the Act (this section provides that a person who wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office must undertake in writing his or her agreement, if appointed to judicial office, to take such training as may be required by the Chief Justice or the President of the Court to which the person concerned is appointed).Section 17 of the Act provides that the procedures do not apply where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint to judicial office a person who is already a judge or, subject to certain conditions, holds certain European or international judicial offices as set out in section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 as amended.The Standards in Public Office Act 2001 requires applicants to certify that their tax affairs are in order.  Section 22(1) of the Act prohibits the Board from recommending a person for judicial office unless the person has furnished to the Board a tax clearance certificate and a statutory declaration that his/her tax affairs are in order.While the ultimate decision as to who should be recommended to the President for appointment to judicial office still rests with the Government, the Government's practice has been, since the establishment of the Board, to recommend only persons who have been recommended as suitable for appointment to judicial office by the Board, in other words, a person whom the Board considers, in addition to having the necessary legal qualifications and experience, has displayed competence in his/her profession, is suitable on grounds of character and temperament and is otherwise suitable.I have no plans to alter the way in which judges are nominated or appointed.  However, the operation of the law continues to be kept under review in my Department.

This is due to the fact that funding for Juvenile initiatives (€10.5 M.) is now under the remit of the Irish Youth Justice Service and this funding has transferred to the IYJS Vote.  However, the Young Persons Probation (YPP), a division of the Probation Service, continues to work closely with the Irish Youth Justice Service in a collaborative way to deliver services to juveniles and in the implementation of the Children Act, 2001, as amended.YearAllocation€m200439.966200544.939200649.719200759.323200854.019

I am advised by the Garda authorities that two types of protective body armour are currently in use by Gardaí.  Detectives are issued with protective vests that have bullet and stab proof properties.  A total of 1,500 of these vests have been issued to date and all detectives have access to them.  Uniformed personnel are issued with lighter and more flexible protective vests which incorporate bullet and stab proof properties and to date 11,500 such vests have been issued to Members.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	498	Over the past 10 years a wide range of security measures have been put in place aimed at reducing the supply of contraband, including drugs, into our prisons.  These measures include:Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons;New visiting arrangements in most closed prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit;Greater use of screened visits;Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison;Increased random searching of cells and their occupants;Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence;Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities;Installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs; andUse of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.In addition, a number of new security initiatives are shortly being introduced in all closed prisons including:The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons;The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams; andThe establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.There are currently drug free units in the following prisons — Wheatfield Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Castlerea Prison and Mountjoy Prison.  There is also an intensive detox programme in operation in Mountjoy Prison.  Allied to this the Training Unit, Arbour Hill Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are regarded as drug free institutions.The Prison Rules 2007 which came into operation in October 2007 gave effect to section 35(2)(j) of the Prisons Act, 2007 which provides for "testing prisoners for intoxicants including alcohol and other drugs".  Mandatory drug testing provides information on trends in drug misuse, enables the identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enables enhanced focusing of resources and acts as a deterrent to drug misuse.  Mandatory Drug testing will also serve to provide important information to prison management that will contribute significantly to decision making in relation to the management of individual prisoners' sentences.  At present, mandatory drug testing takes place in the Training Unit, St. Patrick's Institution, Castlerea Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  All prisoners must be drug free to attend an open centre and the intention is to roll out a programme of testing to the remaining institutions during 2008.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The Report referred to by the Deputy — Review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86 — did not treat in detail with the question of the operation of casinos in this jurisdiction, only to the extent that it reaffirmed the position adopted by the Government in June 1996, arising from a report of a Casino Task Force established by the then Minister for Finance, not to give further consideration to the introduction of legislation to provide for casinos.  In that context the authors of the report Review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86 felt that they were not in a position to make any recommendations regarding the area of casinos other than that: "The ban on casino-type gaming included in the 1956 Act, should be retained in the new legislation to confirm current policy in this area."Under Irish law, gaming and gambling is illegal, except where it is specifically permitted under the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act.  Certain gaming activities are prohibited.  The prohibition identified in the report referred to by the Deputy relates to the activities that are undertaken in casino-style operations, i.e. games where by reason of the nature of the game, the chances of all players including the banker are not equal.  It is by reference to this provision that casinos are not lawful in the State.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of a number of private clubs offering casino-like activities around the country.  These private clubs are visited by the Gardaí and I am informed that to date irregularities have not been detected that would justify a prosecution under the Gaming & Lotteries Acts 1956-86.  I am assured that such premises will continue to receive Garda attention and if breaches of the legislation are detected the directions of the DPP will be sought.  The Deputy will, I am sure, understand that it is a matter for the Garda authorities to investigate breaches of the legislation, and to take whatever action is appropriate.In addition, the legislation proposed to give effect to the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC), currently being drafted as the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering) Bill 2008, will impose on any establishment providing casino-type activities, including private members' clubs, certain obligations in relation to compliance with the Directive.As the Deputy is aware, in August, 2006, the Government agreed to the proposal of my predecessor for the establishment of a Committee (the Casino Regulation Committee) to report on the possibilities for a legislative basis for the strict regulation of casino-style operations in the State.This Committee completed their Report in April last year.  It is a lengthy document which deals with a range of complex and inter-related public policy issues.  Following consultation with my colleagues in Government I am pleased to say that the Report in question will be published within a fortnight.  At that time I will be in a position, also, to announce the steps I intend to take to advance the situation in the most appropriate manner.  Needless to say, I do not propose to comment on the Report or any of its recommendations in advance of its publication.

I will of course consider giving effect to any reforms recommended by the Group in relation to under-age consumption of alcohol in this legislation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The Irish Prison Service has embarked on a major capital programme involving the replacement of the four prisons at the Mountjoy campus, Portlaoise Prison, Cork Prison and parts of Limerick Prison.  The primary objective of this programme is the modernisation of the prison estate, a key component of which will be the provision of in-cell sanitation as a key part of each of these new building projects.It is intended that within the next three to five years all prison accommodation will be equipped with full in cell sanitation.  In this context a new fully equipped 138 place cell block is due to open at Portlaoise Prison later this year and construction is well advanced on another new block at Wheatfield which will provide 144 additional places.The current status of the Thornton Hall Prison project is that negotiations are currently underway with a commercial consortium, which was selected following an E.U. tender procedure for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of the proposed prison facilities.  This will replace the existing Mountjoy Prison.I am pleased to advise the House that the Notice of Development and Environmental Impact Assessment in respect of the project was published on Friday 29 February 2008.  A copy of the Notice of Development has been lodged in the Oireachtas library.

The position remains the same.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	504	At the time of its enactment, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 represented a very substantial modernisation of the law as it then stood.  The Act has operated very satisfactorily and I have no plans for a fundamental review of its provisions.  However, as one would expect in an area of law such as this, it has been necessary to amend it on several occasions since its enactment.  I set out the main amendments below.Section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 inserted Part 2A into the 1994 Act: it provided for offences relating to entering and occupying land without consent.Section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 built upon the 1994 Act by providing for exclusion orders which would allow the District Court to prohibit a person, upon conviction of an offence under Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the Act of 1994, from entering or being in the vicinity of specified catering premises between such times, and during such a period as the Court may specify.Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provided for two new sections, 23A and 23B, to be inserted into the 1994 Act which provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to offences under sections 4 and 5 of the 1994 Act, as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance.Section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 amended Section 19 of the 1994 Act to make it an offence to assault or threaten to assault or to impede medical personnel in a hospital, people assisting such personnel or a peace officer acting in the course of duty. It also expanded the definition of ‘peace officer' to include fire brigade and ambulance staff.I am currently examining the judgement of the High Court in the case of Niall Dillon-v-DPP, a case relating to begging.  It may be necessary to deal with that judgement by way of an amendment to the 1994 Act.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement about that shortly.The Deputy will also be aware that the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee was established last year under Part 14 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to oversee the development of a programme for the codification of the criminal law.  The Committee proposes to include public order offences in the first code instrument to be prepared as part of its work programme for the period 2008 to 2009.  The Committee expects to examine the 1994 Act in that context.

Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and Public Library Services make the largest contribution to, and are the mainstay of, the Prison Education Service.The Department of Education and Science provided an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs in the academic year 2007/08.  This has enabled education to be provided in all prisons, as well as special teaching arrangements where prisoners are segregated (e.g. Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Limerick, Midlands, Castlerea and Cork).Other Agencies also contribute significantly to prison education, for example:The Open UniversityThe Arts CouncilOther third-level colleges, such as the National College of Art and DesignThree full-time librarians, employed by Dublin Public Libraries, work in prisons in the Dublin area.With regard to the curriculum objectives, methods and course content are largely those of adult education.  FETAC accreditation is widely used in prison education with all prison Education Units being accepted as meeting the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.Participation in education generally varies with factors such as access, facilities, turnover of population and segregation.  During 2006 approximately 50% of all prisoners were involved in some education.  25% of the total prison population was intensively involved, i.e. for more than 10 hours per week of classes.  This level of involvement in education whilst in prison is very high by international standards.The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible for those in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help them secure employment on their release.  There are a wide range of training workshops operating within the institutions e.g. metalwork, printing, computers, braille, woodwork, construction, industrial contract cleaning, craft, horticulture, electronics etc.  In addition, the work and training function covers such essential services as catering and laundry services.  The environmental waste management programme and the health and safety function also operate under the aegis of the work and training service.  External accreditation of certified training is available for a number of courses run within the institutions.The Work Training Service comprises an authorised complement of over 250 posts.  Currently, there are over 90 workshops operating, actively catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.

This group has developed a work programme to address matters that need to be aligned with the UN Convention in order that ratification may take place.It is the Government's intention that the Convention will be ratified by Ireland as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary requirements under the Convention are being met.In so far as my own Department is concerned, there is a need to reform the law on legal capacity of vulnerable adults.  The Government's Legislative Programme contains a commitment to bring forward a Mental Capacity Bill.  That Bill is an important element of the programme of work on the Convention.  I am glad to report that the Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage of development in my Department.Question No. 177 answered with Question No. 147.

Such events allow communities to learn about each other's backgrounds and cultures.Integration, however, implies that new cultures and traditions become part of a unified society.  For that reason, I believe that considerable advantage lies in inviting new communities to participate in local and national parades thus emphasising the unification aspect of integration.The Minister of State, Conor Lenihan, T.D. who has responsibility for integration policy, shares my views on this matter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the statistics as requested by the Deputy for the last 10 years are as follows:YearNumber of EscapesNumber of Absconds199889319991418420008123200113952002111212003127020047662005981200669020077136The compilation of statistics relating to all offences for which prisoners have been convicted in the context of their current sentences or previous ones, if applicable, on an individual prisoner basis, would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.I can inform the Deputy that there were 71 persons listed as being unlawfully at large on 4 February, 2008 having absconded from an open centre since 1998.  I can also advise that there were 2 persons listed as being at large having absconded while being supervised on an external work party and a further 4 prisoners who absconded while on a supervised outing with a staff member such as a chaplain, again each case post dates 1998.  In addition there are 3 persons at large having escaped from the custody of prison officers since 1998.In most cases of absconsion, the offender is very much at the lower end of the risk to the public spectrum.  An Garda Síochána is in regular contact with the Irish Prison Service in relation to a range of operational issues, including prisoners who have escaped or absconded.  The Gardaí are informed where prisoners are unlawfully at large and have the power to detain, arrest, and return such persons to prison.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	510	Literacy work has been a strong element of the Prison Education curriculum since the early 1980's.  The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and respects the adult status of the student, his/her prior knowledge, skills and life experience.  It is also concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence.During the academic year 2007/08, the Department of Education and Science has provided an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons.An Adult Basic Education Development Worker is employed with specific responsibility for implementing and supporting developments and initiatives in the area of literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages and basic education.  Because of the literacy deficit of the prisoner population, literacy work forms an element of more than just the timetabled literacy classes.  All teachers are aware of the literacy needs and these are dealt with as part of the general coursework of prisoners.  This is a very effective method of linking the literacy learning programme of prisoners to an area they can engage with and is widely used in adult education.The Irish Prison Service is implementing the new assessment framework devised by the National Adult Literacy Agency; "Mapping the Learning Journey", an assessment framework that identifies learner progress, provides tangible feedback and indicates areas on which to focus.  It is a useful tool for both learning and teaching.Progress has been made linking the education and training needs of prisoners since 2003, with the literacy action plan prepared by the prison education unit of each prison becoming one vehicle for integrating the efforts of the education and training sectors in prisons.  Peer tutoring, promoting family literacy and developing post-release support for prisoners who undertake literacy tuition in prison are also promoted by the Prison Education staff wherever feasible.Each student coming into the Prison Education Centre will have an individual interview to assess his/her educational needs and interests.  Those with literacy difficulties are prioritised and slotted into class almost immediately.  Every effort is made to publicise literacy classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to avail of classes.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The Deputy will acknowledge that whereas the 2006/2007 Annual Report of the Irish Prison Service Chaplains contains certain criticisms of the prison system it also rightly recognises the significant progress that is being made in improving the system.  The Report highlights and welcomes some of the major developments which have taken place in the period covered by the Report.  In particular, the Report welcomed the advances that are being made in enhancing the range of rehabilitative services within the prisons and the provision of additional staffing to support these activities.There are a number of other important issues raised in the Report to which the Deputy refers, and I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of these:Sentence ManagementThe Irish Prison Service is currently planning for the roll out of Integrated Sentence Management (ISM), which will be funded under the National Development Plan, starting in 2008 and delivered progressively over the lifetime of the Plan.  The end result will see a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.Sex Offenders ProgrammeWith regard to the Sex Offender Programme, there is no question of any sex offender who wishes to participate on this programme being denied a place due to the lack of availability.  The Irish Prison Service will provide as many programmes for these offenders as are required.  It should also be noted that in addition to the men currently undertaking that programme, circa sixty other sex offenders have participated during the last year in one-to-one work related to their offending.ReintegrationIn relation to the Report's comments on reintegration, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership with community based groups, has developed a number of projects supporting prisoner reintegration in recent years.  These projects have focused on the range of issues facing prisoners on their release such as homelessness, unemployment etc.EducationEducational services are now available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  During the academic year 2007/08, 220 whole-time-equivalent VEC teachers are the main providers of these education programmes.St. Patrick's InstitutionAs the Deputy will note, the Chaplains' Report commends the recent efforts by the prison management at St. Patrick's Institution to improve conditions there, including the improved educational facilities and the provision of separate accommodation and education units there for those under 18 years and those over 18 years.Drugs PolicyThe Chaplain's Report also welcomed positive developments in the area of drug treatment.  Significant additional resources have been dedicated to enhancing the range and quality of drug treatment services in the prison since the launch of the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy ‘Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons' in 2006.  This has included the appointment of additional Addiction Nurses, Psychologists and Prison Officers and the awarding of a contract for the provision of 24 Addiction Counsellors.  The range and quality of drug services in prisons has been significantly improved and the Irish Prison Service will continue with their phased implementation of the policy of investing in these services.

An initial evaluation based on the material submitted, was carried out by the Information Society Policy Unit of my Department and then by a Committee comprising relevant experts from other Departments and agencies.The information, provided in the application did not establish a sufficiently strong case to secure the funding sought, given the limited resources available and the other applications received.  A further call for proposals will issue shortly in respect of the 2008 allocation for eInclusion and in that context there may be scope to provide a further opportunity for an application of this nature.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Taskforce on Active Citizenship completed its work in March 2007 and presented a set of recommendations to Government on measures that could be taken to increase active citizenship and civic participation.The Government agreed in principle to the recommendations and is proceeding to implement them.  To achieve this, an Office of Active Citizenship has been established in my Department and is currently developing a plan to implement the recommendations, following consultations with relevant Government Departments.The Heads of Departments, in examining the implications of the Taskforce's recommendations, have identified how their existing strategies and programmes take account of the Taskforce recommendations.  These are being considered by the Office with a view to presenting an implementation plan to Government over the coming months.There has been a hugely positive response from both public and private stakeholders in pursuing the active citizenship agenda which I believe will ensure more vibrant, sustainable community life in the years to come.  In particular, the Office, which is chaired by Ms. Mary Davis, continues to consult with various business interests in order to encourage greater connectivity to the community through this sector.  Building on existing initiatives, there is a significant contribution this sector can make to communities nationwide.Consultations are also being held with the wider educational sector with particular regard to raising awareness of the potential for service learning and volunteering.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The projections, which were published in December 2004 and relate to the 2002 Census, provided from a (then) current perspective two contrasting scenarios to reflect the likely range of possible outcomes in respect of international migration.  No explicit assumptions were made in respect of expected growth in the economy.  Instead, two migration assumptions M1 and M2 were framed by the Expert Group in such a way as to give a likely range for migration over the projection period, having regard to recent experience across a range of factors such as the structure of the population and likely national and international trends in relevant areas.Issues that were taken into consideration in framing the two scenarios included:the capacity of our infrastructure to cope with continuing high population growth;reduced labour supply due to the decline in births in the 1980s and 1990s;demographic ‘pull' factors arising from a more rapidly aging population structure in other European countries;sharply decreased pool of Irish migrants living abroad.Updated projections based on the 2006 Census have been finalised and will be published shortly.

Final arrangements have yet to be made, but I can assure the Deputy that it will be completed during the lifetime of this Government.I am happy to inform the Deputy that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will coordinate with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.This Government is fully committed to creating vibrant rural areas nationwide with a strong agriculture and enterprise sector.  In previous Governments I have been privileged to lead, we have placed a new emphasis on the development of rural areas.  Under this Government, we have continued and strengthened this commitment up to 2012.

Its primary role is to manage two cross border European Union funded programmes, the PEACE programme and the Ireland/Northern Ireland/Scotland INTERREG programme.  The SEUPB reports to the North South Ministerial Council.I have been informed that the organisation referred to is in receipt of funding under the PEACE II Programme.The SEUPB has no function in relation to general Departmental funding.  However, there will be further EU funds available under the PEACE III Programme.  The total amount of funding available in the PEACE III programme is €333 million.  This amount is divided between the three priorities of the programme, Priority 1, Reconciling Communities, has been allocated €191 million, Priority 2, Contributing to a Shared Society, has been allocated €122 million and Priority 3, Technical Assistance, €20 million.  The SEUPB is the Managing Authority for the new programme and further details in relation to it and the processes to be followed in applying to the programme are available from the SEUPB website at www.seupb.org.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs Service currently deploys 12 detector dog teams at strategic locations throughout the country.  All these dogs were initially trained in the UK.  It normally takes between 8 and 12 weeks to train a detector dog.  This is followed by joint training of the officer and the dog together, which takes up to a further 9 weeks.  The final part of this training involves orientation and deployment in the actual working environments in the State where the dog will be used.  Continuation and refresher training is also provided on an ongoing basis.  The dogs are used to detect drugs, tobacco and cash.  Passive dogs are used as this allows for the screening of passengers as well as merchandise and baggage.In keeping with their commitment to the Government's National Drug Strategy, the Commissioners have considerably enhanced their drug detection capability in recent years on a number of fronts.  In respect of detector dog teams alone, the number of these has been increased from 6 in 1993 to 9 in 2003 and now stands at 12.  The Commissioners constantly monitor and review the effectiveness of resource deployment and allocate additional resources, where there is a need to do so.The Commissioners also believe in ensuring the detector dog teams maintain a high public visibility at the ports, airports, postal depots and freight forwarders' premises in which they routinely operate.  The Customs' detector dogs also assist an Garda Síochána, whenever requested to do so.

The conclusions of the study will be presented in the first instance for the consideration of Government and then brought to the Oireachtas Consultation Group on the Centenary of the Rising.The study will require several months and a timetable for any ensuing project would be assessed later.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I can confirm that there has been no change in the policy under which persons who have a proficiency in Irish are awarded credit in promotion competitions for such proficiency and no new circulars modifying the application of the policy have been issued by my Department.  However, the overall arrangements under which candidates are awarded credit for proficiency in Irish is currently under review in consultation with the unions represented at the civil service general council.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date. However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, has refused all such requests.Consequently, as the Deputy may be aware, the Finance Bill 2008 includes the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date.However, the Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative mechanisms that may be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	523	As the Deputy is aware, the data relating to the numbers paying tax at the higher rate, the standard rate and exempt were set out in my reply to her question on 26 February 2008.   An explanation as to why the data are presented in this way is contained in the 2007 Budget booklet, pages C.23 to C.28.As I indicate in my previous reply on 26 February 2008, what matters to earners is the amount of their earnings that they keep in their pockets.  For all income earners, whether single or married, the position is that their take home pay has increased very significantly in real terms over the last ten years.As indicated in An Agreed Programme for Government, the aim over the term of Office of this Government is to keep the overall tax burden low and implement further changes to enhance the reward for work while increasing the fairness of the tax system.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 203, inclusive, 206, 209, 211, 213 and 216 together.The position is that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, I would point out that the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on the nature of the good or service and not on the status of the consumer. In this instance, there is no provision in EU law that would permit the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer or sporting, voluntary, local or community based groups.In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.

The Collector-General would be prepared to explore any reasonable proposals that would bring about full compliance with the tax obligations. Such proposals may include a phased payment arrangement, but such an arrangement would include interest.  The specific proposals for phased payments in any individual case would depend on the overall circumstances, including the health of the business, and would be discussed with the taxpayer and/or his agent.

Her spouse is self-employed and therefore, as a chargeable person, is obliged to submit an annual tax return. Following receipt of a completed tax return, a notice of assessment is issued to the taxpayer's spouse and any tax overpaid by the taxpayer may then be refunded. The taxpayer was employed and paid tax in the years 2004, 2005 and 2007. However, completed tax returns for the years 2004 and 2005 are outstanding.  These have been previously requested from the taxpayer's spouse. A completed tax return for 2007 is also outstanding and is due to be filed by the taxpayer's spouse on or before 31 October 2008. On receipt of these outstanding tax returns, the taxpayer's entitlement to a tax refund can then be determined.

I wish to assure you that I am very aware of the situation for the families with children suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am aware also of their hopes regarding a proposed clinical trial led by the MDEX consortium in the UK. The funding of health research being carried out in the UK is not appropriate to the Good Friday Agreement, North South Ministerial Council or the INTERREG Programme, as referred to by the Deputy in his questions. The Department of Health and Children does not directly fund research and I have recommended that the researchers apply to the Health Research Board for joint funding of the proposed trial. However, the researchers would of course have to compete with all the other proposals being received by the Health Research Board.I understand that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland held the first information day on "Advances in the Care of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy" for families and doctors last Sunday 2nd March. I was pleased to be able to support Muscular Dystrophy Ireland by providing over €9,000 towards the costs associated with the information day.

Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.

Although "A Vision for Change" does not specifically mention gender based violence, it identifies violence as one of the risks that may lead to mental health problems.  The Report  recommends a mental health system that addresses the needs of the population through a focus on the requirements of the individual and that mental health promotion programmes should particularly focus on those interventions known to enhance protective factors and decrease risk factors for developing mental health problems.The Womens Health Council Report ‘Violence Against Women and Health', 2007 made recommendations in relation to: training of health professionals in dealing with violence against women, improved screening and counselling of women presenting at health services for violence against women, strengthening the advocacy role of the health services, and improved data collection.Implementation of these recommendations is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

I am aware that the installation of vending machines gives rise to a debate in the context of the supply of foodstuffs and beverages on healthy food choices.  In this context, I should add that the National Taskforce on Obesity, which reported in 2005,  recommended that the health sector in their strategic planning and delivery should advocate and lead a change in emphasis from the primacy of individual responsibility to environments that support healthy food choices and regular physical activity.  The provision of healthy choices must therefore be a key consideration where food is provided in hospitals or in other health facilities.My Department has asked the Health Service Executive to examine the issues raised by the Deputy and to reply directly to him.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I would like to assure the Deputy that tackling all Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.A National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our health system: Staphylococcus bacteraemia; Antibiotic consumption; Alcohol gel use; MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.The HSE intend to publish available data on the above for 2006 and 2007 in April this year and then quarterly thereafter.  The data will be listed by individual hospital and in due course also by each Local Health Office.  This will greatly assist in the monitoring of improvements in infection control.  It will in particular highlight recent trends in the key areas identified and represent a benchmark against which we can assess progress in the future and particularly when and where that progress is being achieved.Improvements on hygiene are critical to effective infection control.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our hospitals in 2007 against hygiene standards developed by the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.  HIQA published its report, the National Hygiene Services Quality Review, on 13th November 2007.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  Hospitals generally performed well on hygiene in the service delivery area.  Most hospitals achieved either extensive or exceptional compliance with the standard in the service delivery section of the report.  However, the results were poor on governance.  While the good hygiene practice of front line staff highlighted in the report is vital, real improvement in this whole are also depends heavily on good leadership and a system of governance.  HIQA is currently working with managers and clinicians to develop national standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  When completed these, along with the national hygiene standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to help reduce the spread of infection and improve the quality of our health care.The availability of isolation facilities is an important factor in the overall solution to the issue of reducing incidence of infection.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.  New environmental building guidelines have been prepared by the HSE to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments.  A process of consultation on the draft guidelines is currently on-going.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that such facilities are in line with best international practice including the provision of adequate numbers of single units.While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infections and to treat them promptly when they occur.

Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (Category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health services.In general, a person should be regarded as being ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the HSE that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year. A national of an EU country who is employed or self-employed in Ireland, is entitled to either full or limited eligibility regardless of the duration of his/her residence in Ireland. Therefore, nationals of Romania and Bulgaria who are legally working in Ireland are entitled to either full or limited eligibility and may apply for a medical card in the normal way.

In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, physiotherapy services over the last number of years.  A particular priority for this Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates.  Training places for physiotherapists have increased by 137.5% since 1997 (from 64 to 152).   My Department has worked closely with the HSE in the provision of clinical placements for these students; an essential component of the therapy degree programmes.I am aware that an issue has arisen whereby some physiotherapy graduates have had difficulty in obtaining employment.  My Department has been addressing this situation in a proactive manner over the last year with a view to ensuring that the various factors which contributed to it are addressed.  In this regard, the Department has chaired a working group with the HSE comprising the relevant stakeholders and has identified the contributing factors to this complex situation.  An Action Plan has been developed to address these matters and the situation is being closely monitored.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Therefore the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter in relation to waiting lists for access to physiotherapy services raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested that the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive investigate the matter and issue a reply directly to the Deputy.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	568	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Child Care Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which, together with the earlier Equal Opportunities Child care Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), are implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are Child Benefit and the Early Child care Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families including supports under the Community Child care Subvention Scheme 2008-2010 which has been introduced under the NCIP.  As far as I am aware, the Department of Education and Science does not at present have any proposal to administer pre-school services or fund pre-school teachers as part of the general education system.The Community Child Care Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced in January 2008 and has an allocation of €154.2 million over the next 3 years.  The Scheme provides an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally and complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the scheme, the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services is, in turn, reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.When I announced the framework for the Community Child Care Subvention Scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to my Office in October 2007 as part of the application process.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed last December and the following adjustments to the scheme were approved by the Government: the child care subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community child care services, were increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents; services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced child care fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place; where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year; special provisions will be provided for in the case of child care services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required; in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 was introduced; as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which could otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.The changes which have been introduced will ensure that the most affordable child care is available to families according to their means.  Put simply, the tiered fee structure is the most effective way of ensuring that the considerable and ongoing Government support for the community child care sector, will be targeted at those who need it most.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that, with an allocation of €154.2 million over a 3 year period for the Community Child care Subvention Scheme, the Government is continuing to offer very generous support to this important sector of Ireland's child care infrastructure.

Persons with full eligibility are entitled to general practitioner services, prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, child health services, home nursing and a maternity and infant care service.  Determination of an individual's eligibility status is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.Other services such as allied health professional services may be available to medical card holders but are not based on a statutory entitlement.  Medical card holders may also be entitled to free transport to school for children who live 3 miles or more from the nearest school, exemption from state examination fees in public second-level schools and financial help with buying school books.  They are also exempt from paying the health levy.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.  It is expected that proposals will be submitted to Government in the first half of 2008.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The introduction of a State funded, nationwide pre-school system for all children is a matter on which I have not had specific discussions with the Minister for Education and Science and, as far as I am aware, there are no proposals at present to introduce such a system.As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Child Care Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which will invest €575 million over 5 years.  Capital funding under the NCIP is available to support the building and refurbishment of preschools and grant aid is also available to support the operational costs of community-based preschools with a focus on disadvantage, under the recently introduced NCIP Community Child care Subvention Scheme.My Office was also responsible for the making of the revised Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 which came into effect in September 2007 with improved standards of regulation for this area.  The Government also supports parents with their child care costs through Child Benefit and the Early Child care Supplement which are universal payments to all parents.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office and it is expected to give rise to expenditure of some €500 million in 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The assessment of eligibility to medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the person and his/her dependants.Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed.  Since the beginning of 2005, the qualification guidelines have increased by a cumulative 29%.  Assessment is now based on a person's and, where relevant, his/her spouse's income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work.  In June 2006, there was a further increase in the qualification threshold for the GP visit card to 50% above that for a medical card.  Furthermore, under the assessment guidelines, applicants whose weekly incomes are derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the stated threshold, qualify for a medical card.The Programme for Government commits to the following: indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage; doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.My Department is currently carrying out a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards, which is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.  When that review is completed, my Department will consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.  The review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards will also give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need, with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The Health Service Executive (HSE) National Service Plan (NSP) for 2005 was approved by me as Minister on 16th March 2005, the NSP for 2006 was approved on 22nd December 2005; the NSP for 2007 was approved on the 7th February 2007 and the NSP 2008 was approved on 10th December 2007.  In addition, there was an addendum to the NSP in 2006 which was approved in July 2006, and an addendum to the 2008 NSP which was approved on  20th February 2008. These two addenda were requested from the HSE in relation to the provision of significant additional financial resources for the HSE as a result of the respective Budget Day announcements. Approval in all cases is conveyed by the issue of a letter of approval from the Minister to the Chairman of the Board of the HSE.Under Section 31 of the Health Act, 2004 the Executive must prepare and submit to the Minister its Service Plan for the coming year within 21 days of the publication by the Government of the Estimates for the financial year. The Service Plan must, amongst other things, indicate the type and volume of health and personal services to be provided by the Executive for the duration of the plan and within the financial resources allocated to it. Once the Plan is submitted to the Minister, it must be approved or a direction issued to the HSE to amend the Plan, within 21 days.  The Minister must also ensure that a copy of an approved National Service Plan is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days after the plan is approved by the Minister.Since the Health Act 2004 was enacted, significant improvements have been made to the format and content of the NSP in order that it more fully and comprehensively satisfies the requirements of the Act.  There is an absolute necessity for the HSE to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation in delivering, at minimum, the levels of service activity specified in its annual National Service Plan. Clearly, this means that the Voted allocations, approved employment levels and service activities — both within the HSE itself and in HSE funded agencies such as the major voluntary hospitals — all need to be planned and actively and prudently managed from the very start of the year.The Department has an agreed monitoring framework with the HSE and  receives detailed comprehensive monthly and quarterly reports from the HSE on all aspects of progression of the NSP.  There are quarterly ‘high level' meetings between the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, and their respective management teams, in order to discuss issues arising in relation to implementation and progression of the NSP.  In addition, there is ongoing liaison and dialogue between various sections within the Department and the corresponding directorates in the HSE.All of the approved National Service Plans referred to have provided both for the maintenance of previously existing levels of health and personal social services, and for the enhancement of those existing levels of service by various new service developments.

Early Intervention Services exist in many parts of the country. Some are run by the Health Service Executive and others are run by the non-statutory agencies. At present there are inconsistencies in approach and delivery of early services. The Health Service Executive is committed to redesigning these services in line with the transformation programme and best practice.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services. The Eligibility for Health and Personal Social Services Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.It is expected that proposals will be submitted to Government in the first half of 2008.Representatives of the Department of Health and Children, Department of Education and Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education meet on a monthly basis to address issues arising in relation to the implementation of the Disability Act, 2005 for children under 5 years, which commenced on 1 June last. The group is also planning for the roll out of Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act, 2004 to children between 5 and 18 years and to adults. Issues in relation to the timely and appropriate provision of health and education supports to children with a range of disabilities including autism are being considered in the context of these discussions.The recently-established Office for Disability and Mental Health will focus in particular on facilitating the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with special needs, by further developing these existing mechanisms for co-operation and co-ordination between the health and education sectors.The Deputy's question in relation to the national review of autism services relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

The Department of Finance has advised that VAT on AEDs cannot be removed or reduced as Irish VAT laws must comply with the requirements of EU VAT law. Under the VAT Directive, member states may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. Annex III does not include general medical equipment such as AEDs for general use.

Patients with eating disorders are also placed in St Patrick's Hospital and St John of God's when required.  In a limited number of cases, consultants make referrals to other specialised eating disorder private services in Dublin or the UK.The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled "A Vision for Change", which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.The report has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.

The purpose of the data warehousing and reporting tool is to improve the existing IBTS blood banking system computer system, Progesa in order to provide a better service to its donors and clients.   Under the terms of that agreement, the IBTS exported data on CD from its Progesa system.  The data was encrypted using a 256 bit key encryption, prior to export on a CD.The IBTS is very conscious of its obligations under the Data Protection Acts to take appropriate security measures against unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.  In this instance, the IBTS is confident that it has complied with these obligations by virtue of the robust security measures which have been taken by the Service and NYBC and considers that the risk of any person being in a position to bypass password controls and decrypt the data is extremely remote.  The IBTS informed the Data Protection Commissioner as quickly as possible of the details of the case and the Commissioner has been in regular contact with the IBTS on the matter.  The Commissioner has noted publicly that the IBTS had a legitimate reason to send the data out of the country, that it had taken its responsibilities to donors and clients seriously and that the information had been securely encrypted.The IBTS has written to each donor affected to reassure them and to advise them of the possibility, however remote, that their personal data might be accessed.  An information line has been set up for anyone with concerns.

Operational management and transformation management arrangements in the North East have now been linked in order to achieve full integration of the transformation programme with the management of operations.My Department understands that the HSE North East made a presentation recently on the North East Transformation Programme to meetings of two Committees of the Regional Health Forum — Dublin and North East.  The HSE advises that it emphasised a clear commitment that existing services in the region will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services.  It also emphasised that an indicative list of measures outlined in the presentation is a draft work in progress.The HSE has advised that it is not possible until the detailed planning phase is complete to be definitive as to what aspects of North East Transformation can be implemented during 2008/2009.  The indicative list which was included in the presentation is dependent on a range of factors including significant change management and changes to work practices.  The degree and pace of change will also be influenced by the extent to which resources can be freed up by the HSE for re-investment in transformation initiatives.Finally, the HSE has advised that no decisions have been taken on reducing services in the North East.  The HSE is facing a challenging year and is exploring, in the case of the North East, how best to deliver on service plan targets within the level of resources available.

The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	605	Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 to 301, inclusive, together.The launch of the National Recreation Policy last September highlighted Government's commitment to the development of youth cafés.As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth cafés in operation around the country. Funding for these existing initiatives such as the Base is provided through a number of bodies including local City/County Council and Health Service Executive. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs also operate a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.At this stage, my focus is to bring better coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying an appropriate model(s) for youth cafés for future developments. Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing cafés looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people. I requested the National Children's Advisory Council's advice on the development of a youth café model and research work has been commissioned by the Council in this regard.  I am anticipating the Council will be in a position to report to me by the end of May.  This work will guide government in ensuring that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth cafés which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Discussions are underway with my Cabinet colleagues regarding a youth café programme and appropriate funding mechanisms. I am considering which agency could best lead on the programme and how to ensure any funding which might be made available augments, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.The Base in Ballyfermot is receiving sponsorship from six bodies including Dublin City Council, the National Development Plan and the HSE. Of those agencies, HSE is the only current funder under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children. I have referred the specific question regarding funding of the Base to the HSE for direct reply.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 307 together.As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which replaced the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which was also administered by my Office.  I understand that the Group in question received capital funding totalling €1.16 million under the EOCP and, as a result, has recently entered their new building.The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) under the NCIP, was introduced by my Office in January of this year and has an allocation of €154.2 million over three years.  This Scheme will continue to support community-based childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Group in question has been approved under the CCSS for transitional funding for the period January-June 2008 of €37,375.  I understand that they received their first instalment of this grant on 22 February.Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In general, the parent profile of services, and the amount of subvention they will receive, are determined on the basis of completed parent declaration forms which are returned as part of the application process.  However, in the case of some specialist services, such as that operated by the Group in question, it is recognised that some additional arrangements may be necessary.  Officials from my Office have been in correspondence and discussions with the manager of the service in this regard and will continue to assist the Group in completing their assessment for funding for the period July-December 2008.  The Group will be informed of their grant aid as soon as it has been determined.Given the roles played by Pobal, the City and County Childcare Committees and the Health Service Executive in the assessment process for grant applicants under the EOCP and NCIP, it is not considered necessary at this point for officials from my office to visit the service to assess the appropriate level of grant aid under the CCSS.

More generally, the PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive.The Chief Executive Officer of the HSE, Professor Drumm, recently reiterated to Oireachtas members the importance he attaches to providing replies to Parliamentary Questions and affirmed his focus on improving the turnaround time for replies to the greatest possible extent.  In this context, on 8th November 2007 the Chief Executive Officer circulated a briefing document to Oireachtas members which informed them of his decision to introduce a time frame of 15 working days for replies from January 2008 and also outlined new accountability structures in that regard.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	619	Generic drugs are widely available in the Irish market, particularly in the hospital sector.  Use of a proprietary drug or a generic equivalent is a matter for the prescriber, in consultation with the patient. My Department supports the increased use of generics where this is appropriate and achievable in the Irish drugs market.A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) was negotiated by a HSE-led team, including representatives from my Department, in 2006.  One of the objectives of the IPHA agreement is to enhance the ability of patients to have a greater say in the prescribing process with a view to choosing, in consultation with the prescriber, the medicine that best meets their needs and delivers best value for money.  The agreement also provides for significant reductions in the price of patent-expired proprietary medicines.  These reductions (20% in March 2007 and a further 15% in January 2009) will, on full implementation, largely remove the current premium paid for these products over many branded and non-branded generic equivalents.  Based on expert advice from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, received prior to the negotiation of the IPHA agreement, it was concluded that a system of compulsory generic substitution in the pharmacy, as used in some other jurisdictions, would have significantly less benefit in the Irish community schemes than in other countries but could, given the relative size of the Irish market, have an adverse effect on continuity and security of supply for Irish patients.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive under the 2004 Health Act.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider this specific issue of consistency of use of generic as opposed to branded medicines throughout the health service, including the cost implications.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these aspects investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	620	Over 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) determined that we require a total of eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  In order to comply with the Standards, the HSE has directed fifteen hospitals with low case volumes to cease breast cancer services.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.  The HSE has designated Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Dublin North East, which includes County Louth.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.

In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The contingency plans include information notices in the newspapers and an information helpline, open from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday.  In response to a written request to all 1600 community pharmacy contractors from the HSE, to date one community pharmacy has confirmed its intention to withdraw services under the present pharmacy contract.  The HSE is keeping this situation under review at local level.The HSE has also assured me that it has plans in place to assist any patient who is unable to obtain their medication.  There are no changes planned to the operation of the GMS and community drugs schemes and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.

My Department supports the use of the Port Tunnel by any bus operator, whether it is Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann or a private operator.My Department informed Dublin Bus on 20 February that its proposal to re-route four of its existing Route 41X services via the Port Tunnel would give rise to competition with an existing licensed service.  Dublin Bus has accordingly been advised that should it wish to pursue the introduction of the proposed service changes on the 41X route so as to compete with the licensed service, the Company is required to make a request for Ministerial consent for approval of the service in accordance with section 25 of the Road Transport Act, 1958.  Alternatively, the Company may review their proposal in order to avoid conflict with the commercial licensed operator.The fact that my Department has issued a licence to a private operator in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932 does not automatically prevent the Department authorising Dublin Bus to operate similar type services along the route or along part of the route in question.

It is not, and never has been, in the control of the Shannon Airport Authority.The business plans for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports, which I have received from the DAA, provide that ARI will remain part of the DAA on the establishment of the three airports as independent entities.  This is a key assumption underpinning the overall financial viability of the DAA on separation.

The Report is available on the websites of both Departments.In relation to roads, one of the key aims of the regional and local road investment programme is to support the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy and more balanced regional development across the entire country.  In 2008, State grants totalling €58.688 million were allocated for regional and local roads to local authorities in the Mid West Region.  In relation to the national roads programme the implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The investment in roads is being complemented by substantial investment in public transport.  Work on the Ennis-Athenry section of the Western Rail Corridor is due for completion in early 2009, and will provide a much needed link between Limerick, Ennis and Galway.  The deployment of new inter-city rail cars will facilitate the future introduction of hourly peak and 2 hourly off peak services on the Limerick-Dublin line. Services on the Limerick-Nenagh line are also to be improved.Bus Éireann, helped by funding under Transport 21, is in the process of renewing its fleet through the purchase of 235 new buses for deployment throughout the country including in the Limerick/Shannon region.

These vessels were not tasked by the Irish Coast Guard but joined the search voluntarily.  The Department of Transport made no commitment to compensate boat owners for the fuel expended during the course of the search.  As a general rule vessels at sea are under an obligation to respond to a distress call at sea.  The Department of Transport does not normally compensate vessels such as lifeboats, community rescue boats or craft of opportunity for the fuel that they have used nor is it international practice to do so.

Ireland's strong support for the promotion and protection of human rights, our long tradition of participating in UN-mandated peace operations, our leading role internationally in disarmament and non-proliferation issues, our work in the area of conflict resolution and the work of Irish Aid on combating gender based violence reflect this commitment.Ireland participated in an event organised by the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations in New York, to mark the first International Day on 2 October 2007.I have asked my officials to liaise with the Indian Government, as the main sponsor of this event, regarding plans for 2 October 2008.

The promotion of gender equality is one of eight Millennium Development Goals agreed by Ireland and other members of the United Nations in 2000.  My Department is contributing directly to reaching this Goal through Irish Aid funding for programmes in developing countries to tackle gender-based violence, female genital mutilation and other human rights violations.The Young Social Innovators (YSI) programme in which Coláiste Bhríde is participating is a very valuable platform for showcasing projects such as this which raise awareness and understanding of development issues. In recognition of this, Irish Aid sponsors an award at the YSI event.A next step for the students of Coláiste Bhríde Carnew is to visit the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre which has recently opened on O'Connell Street in Dublin. The Centre offers an educational programme designed for transition year students which focuses on the Millennium Development Goals and Ireland's role in tackling global poverty and exclusion.A visit to the Centre would help set the research project in the context of the broader development effort and can provide ideas on how to carry forward their project work.I will make arrangements for the official responsible for this area of work to make contact with the group to discuss their findings and to allow them to learn more about Ireland's efforts in this important area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), adopted in the year 2000 as part of the commitments undertaken by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit, represent a measurable framework for development up to the year 2015.  The MDGs are at the heart of our development co-operation programme.  Irish Aid's focus on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people is wholly consistent with the attainment of the MDGs.The latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date.  Overall, there has been good progress on some targets, but the geographical disparities are quite striking. While there has been progress towards the Goals globally since 2000, largely due to advances in China and other Asian countries, Africa is lagging behind on most indicators. This is attributed to a combination of institutional weakness, conflict, and funding shortfalls.In recognition of the extent of the poverty in Africa, Ireland continues to focus over 80% of its bilateral country assistance on sub-Saharan Africa. Much of this assistance is devoted to areas which are essential to achieving the MDGs. These include combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases, building effective health and education systems and addressing natural and man-made emergencies. We work directly with local and national authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the UN and other international agencies and missionaries.  It is working effectively through all these channels, which is most likely to make a real contribution to achieving the MDGs.We are supportive of international initiatives which address the MDGs, such as the MDG Africa Steering Group convened by the UN Secretary General last September. This brought together high level representatives of the African Union, European Union, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, IMF and World Bank, which will meet regularly to examine how to strengthen Africa's efforts to meet the Goals. The Taoiseach has indicated his support for a meeting at Heads of Government level in September 2008 with the aim of intensifying MDG efforts in the period leading up to 2015.The MDGs have given the developed and developing world a clear set of benchmarks to enhance the wellbeing of the world's poorest, within a set timeframe. The commitment of the Government to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development funding, is a clear indication that Ireland will play its role in endeavouring to deliver on these benchmarks.

I am aware that the Mexican courts are currently considering the appeals of some of this group.I have not raised the matter of these convictions and ongoing appeals with the Mexican authorities.  However, Ireland, along with our European Union partners, monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and the fulfilment of their obligations under international law.While Mexico has taken significant steps in promoting respect for human rights, considerable challenges remain to be addressed, in particular at state level. With our EU partners, we will continue to engage in dialogue with the Mexican authorities at both federal and state level.

I issued immediate instructions to our Embassy in New Delhi to raise our concerns, shared also by our EU partners, with the Indian authorities.It is important that these events are fully investigated and addressed by the Indian authorities.  The EU has made clear the importance of law enforcement agencies taking responsibility in this matter and making sure that such violence does not happen again.  I welcome the fact that the Indian authorities have taken this matter seriously, and that senior Government officials have visited the Kandhamal area of Orissa and held talks with community leaders.Human rights, including the right to religious freedom and the rights of minorities, are an important part of our dialogue and discussion with the Indian authorities.  The issue of the treatment of the Christian minority in India has been the subject of regular contacts between the Irish Embassy, EU representatives in New Delhi, and the Government of India, most recently earlier this month. Representations have been made on specific issues relating to religious freedom and in the more general context of EU-India discussions on minorities under the auspices of regular EU-India discussions on human rights issues.

Policy and practice in this regard, including issues associated with the status of a person to whom such a document is issued, are handled by that Department.No new passport application has been received by the Passport Office in respect of the child in question.  It is therefore not possible to comment definitively on whether a passport would issue.  However, if it is the case as the Deputy describes that the adoption has not been approved by the Adoption Board, it would appear that the child may not be an Irish citizen.The Department would wish to help the parents and the child in every way possible. In this regard, our Ambassador in Romania has been asked to see if there is any way that the legal difficulties preventing approval of the child's adoption by the Adoption Board can be resolved at an early stage. Secondly, the Department has been in direct contact with the Romanian Embassy to see if they can be helpful. I have asked the Department to revert directly to the Deputy's Office once it has a clearer sense of a possible way forward.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I remain deeply concerned about the economic hardships and political repression which are affecting the ordinary people of Zimbabwe.Ireland and the EU have supported the process of dialogue between the Zimbabwean Government and the opposition, facilitated by South Africa under a mandate from the Southern African Development Community (SADC).  The talks have not formally concluded but, with the elections drawing nearer, there is no longer enough time to implement any agreement which might be arrived at.  Such an agreement would have to include tackling repressive security laws, curbs on freedom of assembly, restrictive media laws and state violence, in time to ensure that these elections take place in appropriate conditions.The European Union will continue to press for free and fair elections right up until 29 March.  I will be discussing the deeply worrying situation in Zimbabwe with my EU colleagues at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 March.We must also work closely with Zimbabwe's neighbours, in particular South Africa, who are in the best position to influence the situation.  In this regard, and given that the Zimbabwean authorities have stated (most recently in a meeting between a Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry official and an Irish Embassy official on 25 February) that neither the EU nor any EU Member States will be invited to observe the elections, monitoring by regional groups becomes even more important than ever.I understand that SADC has been invited to monitor the upcoming elections in Zimbabwe. For our part, we have proposed to our EU partners that the EU explore with SADC how it plans to respond to this invitation and to encourage such a monitoring mission. In pursuit of this, I have also asked our Embassy in Lusaka to raise this question directly with the Zambian Government, which is currently Chair of SADC.

It is participating in the recently launched Optimising Power @ Work, Staff Energy Awareness Campaign being led by the Office of Public Works. This campaign, which will begin in the Department this month, aims to achieve a minimum of 15% reduction in total annual carbon dioxide emissions through an intensive staff energy awareness initiative promoting efficiency in respect of all energy consuming processes.The Department's current policy is to use a number of energy saving devices such as energy efficient lights, powersave function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex (double-sided copying) facilities.It is also the policy of the Department to put measures in place for the prevention and reduction in the amount of waste generated and to maximise opportunities for the re-use and recycling of waste arising.  Contracts are in place for the collection and recycling of paper and cardboard packaging from my Department's main offices.In relation to redundant electronic IT equipment, the Department arranges for the reuse of suitable equipment and, where this is not possible, avails of the take back facilities under the WEEE Regulations for the dismantling and recycling of such equipment.Since the beginning of 2006, carbon emissions have been taken into account in vehicle purchases made by the Department. In order to take account of the wider availability of new technologies, the Department, at my request, is currently preparing a policy on the purchase of official vehicles, to ensure that environmental considerations are taken fully into account as official vehicles are replaced, which is normally done at four year intervals.I fully support the commitment in the current Programme for Government to ‘Require carbon offsetting of all official air travel in support of urban forests'. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will announce details of a scheme for use by all Government Departments and bodies under their aegis which will address this commitment. Once the details are announced, the new scheme will be appropriately implemented by the Department.

Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.  Through its network of 34 overseas offices, Enterprise Ireland assists client companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.I would suggest that the person concerned should, in the first instance, make direct contact with their local CEB and explore what level of assistance, if any, may be available to them.

In 2007, the Department of Education and Science provided to FÁS 11,133 places nationally for Phase 4 and Phase 6 in the Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Further Education.FÁS schedules apprentices on the longest waiting basis, based on home address to the nearest Institute of Technology or College of Further Education, depending on programme availability and capacity in the respective Institute of Technology and College of Further Education. The number of Apprentices who were scheduled to attend Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Further Education in Dublin for the Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training programmes in 2007, who had a home address outside of Dublin, was 1,579 of which 255 were from Munster.FÁS provides a training allowance to each apprentice attending a Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training programme and this is supplemented by the provision of an accommodation allowance for those required to secure accommodation for their attendance at their scheduled off–the-job training programme.  FÁS also provides to apprentices, on request, information on accommodation availability in the Dublin Region.

Two of the buildings occupied by my Department and its Offices have been selected to participate in this initiative and a consultant, appointed by the OPW, is working with the Department to try to achieve this target.  It is hoped to extend this initiative and to strive to achieve the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 15% in all of the buildings occupied by my Department and its Offices in the coming years.As regards the Agencies of my Department, the Deputy will appreciate that ensuring maximum energy efficiency and minimum carbon footprint in their daily operations is an operational issue for the Agencies concerned but the Deputy can rest assured that the Agencies have taken similar actions to those mentioned above over the past few years and will continue to do so.

Following that meeting, it was agreed that the various bodies represented on the Group would provide a synopsis of their interest, involvement or role in relation to Spike Island, their potential role in developing, supporting or operating the Island as a tourism project, and what form, if any, they consider that project might take.My Department subsequently prepared and circulated a comprehensive questionnaire to the relevant Departments and bodies to elicit this information and the Department is currently examining the replies received.  These contributions will form the basis of a report which the Group will then consider for agreement; a further meeting will be held if necessary.  It is expected that this process will be completed in the near future.Any recommendations or conclusions in a report of the Group in relation to possible future developments on the site will be for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to consider in the first instance.

Grants of €757,000 have been made available to the Arts Council in 2008 for touring, effectively doubling the Arts Council annual allocation for this initiative.  I hope to build further on this in the coming years as part of increasing access to arts.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	661	There are currently three buildings occupied by my Department, two of which are located in Dublin at Kildare Street and South Frederick Street where my Department is not the main tenant in either building.  This limits to some extent the action that can be taken directly by my Department to reduce its carbon footprint. The third is at Fossa in County Kerry, which accommodates an advance party of 70 staff in the context of decentralisation of my Department to Killarney.During 2007, an Energy Efficiency Committee was established in my Department in the context of the Partnership process to examine energy usage and raise awareness among staff of the need for energy efficiency. In conjunction with the Government's Power of One campaign, the committee organised a number of presentations for staff to outline tips on energy saving actions, both at work and in the home. An Efficiency Suggestions Scheme competition was also held, which invited staff members to make suggestions on making the Department more energy efficient.I was delighted to personally present the prizes for the best suggestions to staff in July last year. All suggestions submitted have been published and provided to staff in my Department.These initiatives resulted in notices being placed at electrical equipment and light switches in my Department to remind staff to switch off lights and equipment to save energy. In this context, staff are requested to switch off information technology and any electrical office equipment when not in use and particularly at the end of the working day. Furthermore, all personal computer monitor screens purchased by my Department in 2007 are flat-screen technology, which are far more energy efficient than the old Cathode Ray Tube monitors used.Where my Department is the only tenant in the building in Fossa, it has recently signed up to the Government electricity contract on a Green supply, which comes from renewable energy sources. My Department has also reduced the exterior lighting of the building to ensure that as soon as the building and car park has been vacated of staff, all the exterior lighting can be switched off, with just a single light over the front door remaining on all night for security purposes. Previously the full exterior lights had remained on throughout the night.There is a permanent video conferencing link between my Department's buildings in Kildare Street in Dublin and in Fossa, which facilitates meetings between staff located in the two buildings. This reduces the need for travel by the staff in my Department between both locations.It is also my Department's policy to promote the increased usage of recycled paper as much as possible and my Department has a system in place at its three locations to ensure that all used waste paper is issued for recycling.In the context of the implementation of decentralisation, construction is currently underway on a new headquarters in Killarney, which will be a "green" building, which will provide a pleasant working environment and yet be economical to run.  The design of the building, which has been carefully conceived in line with an exacting brief provided by the Office of Public Works, makes use of many environmentally friendly and energy saving features in line with best practice, nationally and internationally.The specific measures being taken by the agencies under the aegis of my Department to reduce their carbon footprint in 2007/2008 are a matter for the agencies themselves but I can assure the Deputy that they are conscious of the need to take action in this regard.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	666	The expenditure on rent supplement and number of recipients for the administrative areas, as listed by the Deputy, are shown in the following tabular statement.Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must satisfy a means test and be habitually resident in the State. The HSE must satisfy itself also that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need for which he or she cannot provide, that a bona fide tenancy arrangement exists between the applicant and the landlord and that the property being rented is suitable to his or her needs.In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person's accommodation needs, the Executive must establish the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have. As part of this process, the Executive may carry out a visit to the residential premises in question.This home visit may also be used to confirm the applicant's residence at the address. The HSE has confirmed that it is standard practice to visit all residential premises within the area outlined by the Deputy.The HSE may consider that a property is not suited to the applicant's needs if the accommodation does not comply with housing regulations. Enforcement of such regulations is a matter for Local Authorities rather than the Community Welfare Service of the HSE and Community Welfare Officers are not qualified to undertake this work.Payment of rent supplement may be withheld where the HSE is notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards. The HSE has confirmed that no such notifications have been received in respect of rent supplement tenancies within the administrative areas identified by the Deputy. Consequently, no rent supplement payment has been withheld for this reason in the areas in question.Health CentreNo. ClientsTotal Rent Supplement Paid€Benburb Street2051,107,479Botanic Avenue5042,409,754Cabra — Quarry Rd1,2565,974,014East Wall214,998Lisburn St6763,219,406Millmount Avenue4941,881,289North Strand1,1124,928,634Summerhill35167,421

New processes and procedures which are based on these provisions were put in place from that date to ensure that marriages which take place are legally valid.Section 46 of the Act requires that, save in exceptional circumstances, couples intending to marry in the State attend the office of the registrar in person to give notification of intention to marry at least three months in advance of the intended marriage date and to sign a declaration that there is no impediment to the marriage. This provision also gives the registrar authority to request evidence from each of the parties in relation to the verification of identity, current marital status, nationality etc. and the procedures in place provide for this. Notices of intention to marry may be published and are available for inspection at the registrar's office. The meeting between the registrar and the couple provides an opportunity for the registrar to elaborate on all the requirements for a marriage to be civilly recognised and to clarify any issues which may arise.Section 48 of the Act provides for the issue of a Marriage Registration Form ( MRF ) without which no marriage may be legally solemnised. In essence, this form constitutes the approval of the registrar to the marriage proceeding. An MRF will be issued only when the registrar is satisfied that all the statutory requirements relating to a valid marriage have been met. The MRF contains the details of the parties to the marriage, of the registered solemniser who will solemnise the marriage and of the witnesses and it must be given to the solemniser before the marriage ceremony.Section 51 of the Act sets out the manner in which a marriage must be solemnised. The solemniser must be a registered solemniser. The place in which the ceremony takes place must be open to the public and the solemniser must be satisfied that the parties to the marriage understand the nature of the ceremony and the declarations which they must make as part of the ceremony. These declarations are that there is no impediment to the marriage and that they accept each other as husband and wife. This section also provides for the use of an interpreter where one of the parties to the marriage, the solemniser or one of the witnesses does not have sufficient knowledge of the language of the ceremony.There is also legal provision for the making of an objection to the marriage proceeding, and this can be made at any time before the ceremony.Staff in all of the registration offices have been provided with detailed documentation concerning the application of the requirements of the new legislation and have been given comprehensive training on these.In view of the above the Registrar General is satisfied that the processes and procedures in place are sufficient to ensure that marriages are being solemnised in accordance with the law.

A first payment, including arrears, issued to him on 25 February 2008.The means assessment in this case is based on information supplied by the person concerned in relation to his earnings in 2006.  It is open to him to provide my Department with more recent evidence of his earnings or to appeal the deciding officer's decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office and a form for this purpose has been issued to him.Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	670	Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.The Southern Area of the Executive has advised that the person concerned has already received a number of exceptional needs payments in addition to a number of heating supplements. The person concerned was refused an ENP for clothing in January 2008, as it was deemed that evidence of an exceptional need had not been presented. The Executive has stated that the matter is currently under review with the Executive's Appeals Office and has advised that the person concerned will be notified of its decision in due course.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.The Health Service Executive has advised that the persons concerned are currently in receipt of a rent supplement of €598.13 per month and that the Executive's Appeals Office is to make a decision in relation to any arrears due. The persons concerned will be advised of the decision in due course.Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €13 a week towards accommodation costs as they are also required to contribute a portion of any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate.The assessment of additional income of participants on a training course, such as the community employment scheme, has always been a feature of the rent supplement scheme. A person participating on a community employment scheme can continue to receive rent supplement, subject to satisfying the standard means assessment.  Under improvements provided for in Budget 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75, is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.

If at any stage since starting work, a person has no contributions paid or credited for two full consecutive tax years, he or she will not have an entitlement to credited contributions until he or she returns to work and pays appropriate contributions for at least 26 weeks.My Department's records show that the person concerned had previously paid contributions in the 1999/2000 contribution year.  Since then she has only been employed from 6 December 2007 to 18 January 2008.  Accordingly, she is not entitled to sign for credited social insurance contributions.

This payment is means tested and in the case of separated persons also dependent on the recipient having sought maintenance from their former spouse.The weekly rate of payment is €197.80, with an additional €24 per qualified child. The payment can be made until a child is 18, or 22 if in full-time education.A claimant is entitled to have earnings up to €146.50 disregarded for the purposes of the payment with half the balance of any earnings up to €400 disregarded as means (this will increase to €425 in May 2008). In addition, a claimant can offset up to €95.23 received in maintenance per week against rent or mortgage payments. Thereafter, half of any balance of weekly maintenance is assessed as means.Parents earning more than this upper income limit may also be able to claim Family Income Supplement, which is a payment made to families at work on low income.Widows/ers under the age of 66 and without children can claim widow's non-contributory pension, which is paid at the same rate as OFP. This payment is also subject to a means test.

However, under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may apply for the exceptional needs payment.The scheme is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Under the scheme, an exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. Recipients of an exceptional needs payment would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.There is no automatic entitlement to Exceptional Needs Payment.

Since 2005 overall numbers in the Department have been reduced by 400 and another 500 staff have been redeployed to new schemes. The location of posts has to take account of business requirements in a changing environment.  Therefore this Department's staff levels in various locations has to be adjusted from time to time. There has been significant reductions in staff levels in the majority of this Department's Offices including local offices over the last 3 years. For example the Department's staff in Castlebar has reduced by over 50%.  This Department will continue to monitor the situation in Johnstown Castle to ensure that all staff have gainful employment and can contribute fully to the achievement of the Department's mission. To this end a number of functions have been transferred to Johnstown Castle in recent times including the Wildlife Administration Unit, the Beef Import Licensing Section and additional resources have been assigned to the administration of Forestry, On-Farm Investment and REPS schemes.The decentralisation programme as it relates to this Department involves the movement of posts from Dublin to Portlaoise; Cork city to Fermoy; the rationalisation of the Department's laboratories in Munster to Macroom; and the now completed move of the fisheries function to Clonakilty. No posts have or will move from Wexford to Portlaoise under the programme. Outside of the programme, posts may relocate within the Department in order to deliver operating efficiencies.

The proposals represented a move away from designation based on socio-economic factors, (declining rural population, low productivity and low farm incomes), to a methodology favouring physical characteristics, (soil type, poor climate, slope and altitude of land).  Agreement was not achieved because of the level of opposition from many Member States.  Accordingly, the Commission agreed to allow the current criteria stand until 2010, with proposals, for new criteria to be brought forward in 2008, for implementation from 2010 onwards.An evaluation of the Less Favoured Areas Measure in the  Member States was carried out on behalf of the Commission by the Institute for European Environmental Policy and published in November, 2006.  Bilateral meetings between the Commission and Member States, are taking place and following their conclusion the Commission intend to prepare and finalise a proposal for submission to the Council of Ministers. It is expected that this proposal will be made in May 2008 with a view to having it adopted by the Council prior to the end of this year.My officials and I will work very closely with the Commission and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers with a view to achieving the optimum outcome for Ireland.

The re-introduction of the ewe premium is one of several recommendations made in the Ernst and Young report to address issues in the sector. It is premature to draw definitive conclusions as to the merits of those recommendations. I will be guided by the discussions at the Council of Ministers and by the ongoing consideration within my Department as to the advantages and disadvantages of possible support actions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market. The Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group and the subsequent Implementation Group set the blueprint for the sector's future development. Most of the recommendations fall to be implemented by the industry itself but my Department and the state agencies under my aegis are also playing an active role.Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and there are signs of interest in it among applicants to date under that scheme.The plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Genetic Improvement Programme have been advanced.  The next stage of the process is to agree an interim structure and framework for a new breed improvement programme and extensive consultation with all stakeholders is planned in forthcoming months. My Department is taking the lead in arranging these consultations with the involvement of the farm bodies, pedigree breeders, Teagasc and ICBF. It is hoped that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 sheep breeding year.Transparency on pricing is a pre-requisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market. Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced. My Department is facilitating trials on this that are set to begin later this month.Teagasc are making a very positive contribution as well and have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007. Bord Bia is also playing a prominent part. A total of 4,683 farms have been registered to date and 2,501 farm audits have been carried out. In 2007 the Department made available €0.4m to support inspections under the scheme and this funding will be repeated again in 2008 and 2009.In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are very necessary. Bord Bia will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns marketing in selected European markets. The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.

One of the most significant initiatives was the installation in 2007 of a new wood-fired heating system in my Department's offices at Johnstown Castle, Wexford, as an alternative to fossil fuel.  This system provides all office and water heating.  Following a survey carried out by the Office of Public Works it has been decided to install biofuel heating systems in the following offices of my Department; Ballina AES Office, Cavan Regional Office, Castlebar Office, Ennis Local Office, Enniscorthy Local office, Longford Local office, Mullingar Local Office and Nenagh Local Office.  It is envisaged that the Office of Public Works will have these systems installed later this year.  Also, in recent months the electricity supply to the following Regional Offices has been switched to renewable energy sources; Cavan, Johnstown Castle, Maynooth  and Portlaoise.In addition, recycled paper/paper products accounts for approximately 25% of expenditure on office supplies in my Department.  A large percentage of the additional spend would be in respect of printer paper.  The printer paper currently used in my Department, though not recycled, is produced from renewable forest sources.  The supplier has indicated that a new recycled paper of a higher quality that may overcome the machinery reliability issues is now available.  This product will be tested by my Department in the near future.Other measures in place include:The use of automotive diesel with 5% biodiesel blend in the farm road vehicles at Abbottstown and Backweston farms,The use of video-conferencing between the various office locations,The promotion of on-line services,The provision of an e-working facility whereby staff may work away from their ‘home' office, where suitable, in a Departmental office nearer to their home,The replacement of Cathode-Ray Tube monitors with flat-screen monitors and the introduction of energy-efficient PCs/Servers, which have power-management features,The disposal/recycling of all ICT related hardware equipment in an environmentally friendly manner, andA daily bus service from Wexford Town, which brings staff to and from work in Johnstown Castle.My Department is also of course involved in the development and promotion of a number of green energy projects.  Measures taken by agencies under the aegis of my Department to reduce their carbon footprint are operational matters for the agencies themselves.

The SPHE curriculum is mandatory up to Junior Certificate Level in which substance use is one of 10 modules taught.The senior cycle Curriculum Framework for SPHE has been agreed by Council.  However, Council was of the view that as the implementation of such a framework would present many challenges for schools and the education system, it should, when issued to the DES, be accompanied by comprehensive advice on how the framework should be implemented in schools.All post-primary schools are invited to inservice training in SPHE each spring and autumn on a regional basis.  A selection of SPHE topics are offered to teachers, including substance use education.  Health Promotion Officers and Regional Development Officers along with experts in specific areas, such as substance use education are involved in the delivery of this inservice.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) SPHE course committee has finalised a Framework SPHE curriculum for Senior Cycle students at post-primary level, and is now in the process of working with a small group of schools looking at how the framework could best be implemented at ground level before finalising advice for the DES on the implementation of the Framework. Both the Framework and the advice on implementation should be approved by Council by June and will subsequently issue to the DES.  The evidence available to me from the national SPHE Support Service informs me that the substance misuse education prevention programmes being implemented as an integral part of the SPHE curricula is in line with best international practice.

Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced to date. A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC), representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as of my Department, has been progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further coherent implementation of the Act.  The work of this sub-committee is continuing.Significant progress has been made since 2006 in the roll out of the Act at local level.  A structure for the resourcing of VECs to carry out the functions set out for them under the Youth Work Act, 2001 was agreed between my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association (on behalf of the 33 VECs) in July 2006.  This structure provided for the appointment of a number of Youth Officers (21.5 posts) to be shared by 25 VECs and outlined the salary scale and functions of the posts.  In addition, existing posts in the remaining eight VECs were re-designated as Youth Officer posts.  I will determine further sections of the Act for implementation, having regard to the advice of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, as the necessary procedures are finalised and as resources permit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 and 401 together.Final data are not yet available on the number of pupils leaving or entering schools for the 2007/2008 school-year.  Data on the numbers of pupils leaving National Schools and entering aided Second Level schools in 2005 and 2006 are contained in the following table.Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which has being implemented in 873 schools comprising 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.  This represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach.  This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3–18 year olds in this country.The key principle of early intervention, to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early, is a major component of DEIS, with a continuing emphasis being placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second-level, by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the School Completion Programme in this area.The School Completion Programme was established to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.  In line with current thinking, the Programme favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process.  It entails targeting individual young people, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in educational access, participation and outcomes.  A key component of the School Completion Programme (SCP) is developing strong links between primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme is a key intervention to improve the educational outcomes of children from disadvantaged areas by promoting active cooperation between their parents and teachers and encouraging community involvement. Through their work with parents, HSCL officers seek to raise parents' awareness of the need to encourage their children to work hard at school and to help parents to improve their own capacities to enhance their children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills.Progression from primary to second-level is recognised as a crucial transition period in a child's education.  Initiatives such as Familiarisation Days and week-long transfer programmes for new entrants to second level have been shown to have very positive results in helping children to make a smooth transition to their new school.  The strengthening of such programmes is being prioritised under DEIS.200720062005Number of pupils who went to a publicly aided Second Level School in the StateFinal data not yet available51,25051,943Source: Census of Primary Schools, Statistics Section.Notes1 The year refers to the full year immediately preceding the primary census date.

It is, therefore, primarily a matter for each school to devise guidelines around the types of food that is available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and welfare of the pupils.  I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents' associations and I would encourage others to do so also.In relation schools/colleges provided under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model my Department has to date entered into three separate contracts.  The three contracts cover the 5 Pilot PPP Schools, the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music.In the contracts agreed for the 5 Pilot Schools while the Operator is responsible for the vending machines the location, content and availability of vending machines were agreed through discussion between the Operator and the School Authorities concerned.  The contract stipulate that, if catering and/or vending is provided, the PPP Operator must pay a guaranteed income to the authority regardless of the level of net income received from these services.The Minister and or the Management Authority of the school can also request the PPP Operator to withdraw products from sale.  Where products are withdrawn the contract  provides for the level of guaranteed income to be revised.  The contract does not, however, require that a level of compensation be paid to the PPP Operator.  In the Cork School of Music and in Bundles 1 and 2 the presence of the vending machines and their content is entirely a matter for the school authority.

The requisite qualifications for filling Learning Support/Resource Teaching posts and Resource Teaching posts are outlined in section 6 of my Department's circular Sp Ed 02/05, a copy of which has issued to all schools.With regard to the development of teacher skills, the Teacher Education Section of my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) in September 2003.  The service consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings.  These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.  The SESS provides comprehensive in-service training and support in the following areas:In-School SupportIndividual Professional Development (Face-to-face and through online media)Group Professional Development InitiativesTelephone Helpline and E-mail SupportIn addition, Teacher Education Section (TES) funds accreditated courses for teachers to develop their knowledge and skills with regard to Special Educational Needs and learning support.  These courses include:Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education, which is available through seven institutions throughout the country and Masters qualification in Special Educational Needs (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra)Graduate Certificate in the education of pupils with ASD (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) Certificate/Diploma in Education (Special/Inclusive Education) which is delivered online on a collaborative basis by the Institute of Child Education and Psychology and St Patrick's College Drumcondra.In relation to Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), I wish to advise the Deputy that the TES also funds SNA Certificate courses in Mary Immaculate College, St Angela's College and Church of Ireland College of Education.  The TES also fund introductory courses for SNAs in Education Centres throughout the country.In 2007, over 17,000 training places were provided by the SESS for teachers wishing to avail of continuing professional development in Special Educational Needs and 430 places were provided on accredited courses for teachers of children with Special Educational Needs.  In addition, the Teaching Council was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession at primary and post-primary levels, to promote the professional development of teachers and to regulate standards in the profession.As the Deputy can see, significant investment has been made in the area of teacher training and upskilling in recent years and I am confident that those helping children with special educational needs have the opportunity to develop their skills in this area where necessary.

This circular is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act,1998 assigns each Board of Management and Principal Teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools.  Principals should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours.  In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the Rules for National Schools and Section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school activities.  Accordingly, the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision remains.While my Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of different age pupils, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of the pupil.  This duty, in the case of very young pupils, might include an obligation to ensure that such pupils do not leave the classroom without appropriate supervision.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I assume the Deputy is referring to the Small Schools Scheme — also known as the devolved scheme — under which schools have been offered funding to build a small number of extra permanent classrooms. As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has prioritised improvements in school buildings with unprecedented levels of investment and improved delivery mechanisms. The Small Schools Scheme did not exist at all until we introduced it in 2003. Between 2003 and 2007, nearly 400 schools were approved for funding under this scheme. As I have made clear in my speech on Budget 2008 and on many occasions since, with so many small projects completed in recent years, the focus of the school building programme this year will be primarily — but not exclusively — on larger projects. In that context, the Small Schools Scheme will not be on the same scale this year as in 2007. Decisions regarding the allocation of funding in respect of the scheme in 2008 will be taken in due course. The approximately €600 million being provided for the school building programme this year represents a 9% increase on the school's capital allocation in Budget 2007.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	717	As the Deputy may be aware, the vast majority of support for childcare, including pre-school education, is not provided by my Department, but is now provided by the Office of the Minister for Children under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme.Investment of €575 million under the NCIP aims to create an additional 50,000 places. 10,000 of these places will be for pre-school children.My Department's main interventions in Early Years have been targeted towards children who experience disadvantage or who have special needs.  This will continue to be a priority for my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	718	During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems. An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects in addition to investment in site purchases; the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, science and technology initiatives, contingency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment including improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. My Department also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects.The budget for 2007 was the first year of the rollout of the new NDP 2007-2013 which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school building infrastructure over the coming years to ensure that school places are available where needed. This investment will be the largest in the history of the State and will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas and the upgrade of existing accommodation.  Construction in 2007 alone involved over 1500 building projects which will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils.The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.The particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also showing the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.On 1 February, I announced a list of schools which are due to go to construction in 2008. It is also my intention to make a further announcement after Easter to allow a further batch of schools to commence construction and to update progress on the new schools planned for September 2008 delivery in developing areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis. In addition, there are in the region of 2,100 children with autism who are receiving additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in mainstream schools.My Department is currently funding a number of ABA pilot schemes which was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. These centres currently cater for approximately 240 children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	720	As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice,  encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.I can inform the Deputy that during 2006/07 my Department, through NEPS, funded some 4,416 psychological assessments under the SCPA, 3,645 of which related to pupils in primary schools and 771 in post-primary. In this period NEPS psychologists undertook casework in respect of some 8,183 named pupils, including cases under the Reasonable Accommodation for Certificate Examinations (RACE) scheme on behalf of the State Examinations Commission. Of this total 4,301 cases related to primary pupils and 3,882 to post-primary pupils.  In addition it is estimated that NEPS psychologists gave consultations, advice and assistance to teachers and school authorities in respect of an additional 5,000 un-named pupils, although this figure is not disaggregated by level of school.Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and during 2008 this complement will increase to 169. In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews in this regard have recently been completed and regional panels are currently being formed from which recruits will be drawn for appointment to priority regions. As I have previously stated, and in line with Government commitments under the T2016 Agreement, it is further my intention to increase NEPS psychologist personnel to 200 during 2009.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	722	In 2002 my Department approved the provision of an additional 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy in University College  Cork, National University of Ireland, Galway and University Limerick in addition to 25 places on an existing course in Trinity College Dublin.  As a result there has been a significant increase in the numbers of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from universities in recent years.  Some 92 Therapists graduated 2007 compared to 21 in 2004.It is understood from the Higher Education Authority that 109 places are currently offered annually on Speech and Language Therapy courses compared to 25 places in 2002.The following table details the number of graduates from 2002/03 to 2006/07.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis.The Deputy will be aware that the pilot programme to which she refers was established in the absence of this network of special classes that is now in our schools and will not be expanded. We are determined instead to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education that is now being made available in schools throughout the country.The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism.I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed and my Department officials have met with the IAA on several occasions to progress this matter. Capital funding for centres will also be included in the discussions. While these discussions are ongoing, my Department will not fund any expansion in the number of children attending the centres. Special schools cater for children up until they are 18 years of age.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	728	The Deputy will be aware that the education of children with special educational needs is a key policy priority for the Government. Much has already been achieved in this area in terms of delivering additional teaching and care supports. There have been significant developments in special education since 1998 involving enhanced levels of provision as well as new structural and legislative frameworks for the delivery of services to pupils with special educational needs.There are now over 8,800 teachers at primary and post-primary schools working directly with children with SEN, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,700 in 1998. In addition, significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of special needs assistants (SNAs) in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs. There are currently in excess of 9,800 SNAs in primary, post-primary and special schools supporting pupils with special care needs compared with approximately 300 in 1998.Additional teaching supports are allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs. It must also be acknowledged that, during the necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004, the Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs.As the Deputy will be aware, Primary and Second-Level schools have a responsibility to provide a broad, balanced and appropriate curriculum for all students. Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is now part of the curriculum for all pupils in primary schools. It provides specific opportunities to enable the child to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships, and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.SPHE has been compulsory in the junior cycle of second-level schools since September 2003. It provides students with a unique opportunity to develop the skills and competence to learn about themselves and to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.Modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well-being, influences on decision-making, and relationships and sexuality education. In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies which can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help. SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.The implementation of the SPHE curriculum by schools is a very important strand of Government policy in addressing a range of social and health issues covered by a wide range of policies/strategies, including the National Drugs Strategy, the National Suicide Prevention Strategy and the report of the National Task Force on Obesity.Work on the development of a curriculum for SPHE in Senior Cycle is now at an advanced stage and the Department looks forward to receiving the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's (NCCA) recommendations in the matter. Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.All post-primary schools receive ex-quota hours from my Department for the provision of a guidance and counselling service to students. The service is delivered in the majority of schools by guidance counsellors who are qualified to provide counselling support to students.Schools can also use additional resources provided by my Department under various initiatives to buy in the services of a qualified counsellor/psychotherapist if they consider this necessary to meet students' needs. For example, schools participating in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS), the School Completion Programme and the Guidance Enhancement Initiative (GEI) can, and do, use some of the resources received under these initiatives to buy in counselling services.My Department also provides funding to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC) for a programme of professional supervision for its members. In its first year, 75% of guidance counsellors participated in this programme which is operated through education centres on a national basis. Approximately 60 qualified counsellors provide support and advice on a range of counselling and mental health issues to the guidance counsellors who are participating in the programme. In addition, my Department provides funding to each of the sixteen branches of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to support the provision of continuous professional development for the members of each branch.Through the Education Equality Initiative the Department has funded Schizophrenia Ireland to design and develop training materials for educators and students who self-experience mental illness; to implement awareness training programmes for staff in further education colleges; to set up support structures for people with self experience who aspire to attend Further Education courses and to research good practice in Ireland and abroad. Third Level Learning support services provided to students with mental health difficulties include one-to-one specialist tuition and subject specific tuition. One-to-one specialist tuition provides students with organisation, communication and learning skills to cope with the demands of social, personal and academic integration into Higher Education. Additional subject specific tuition may be provided to compensate for lectures missed due to absences, hospital appointments, effects of medication etc.I assure the Deputy that further improvements in supports for young people are a priority and that recommendations in ‘A Vision for Change' are being considered in that context.

An application for major capital works is being progressed to extend the school to cater for this development.Appointment of a design team is the first step in the architectural planning of a major capital school building project, accordingly, I correctly stated on the 14th of February last that the proposed project is in the early stages of architectural planning.The process to appoint a Design Team for the proposed building project commenced in October 2007 and the Pre Qualification Stage is complete.  Issue of Award Stage documentation will take place in the near future.  The process to appoint the Project Supervisor at Design Process (PSDP) is completed.When the Design Team is appointed, the progression of the project through the various stages of architectural planning will be progressed in the context of my Department's multi annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	732	The project to which the Deputy refers received funding as an exceptional matter and on a once-off basis in 2007 under the Fund for the Development of Targeted Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk.In assessing applications for funding, my Department gives consideration to interventions already in place and supported by my Department in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resource. My Department currently supports 30 schools (6 post primary and 24 primary schools) in 6 School Completion Projects under DEIS, the Action Plan for Social Inclusion in this area. The 6 School Completion Projects receive over €1.5 million in total annually.  In addition, a variety of other interventions in place these schools under DEIS such as reduced class sizes, appointment of administrative principals on lower enrolments, Home School Community Liaison, a range of literacy/numeracy initiatives, Free Book Grant Scheme, Meal provision and additional financial resources. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to support a separate initiative in an area which provides a similar service to the same target group.As a condition of funding provided in 2007, the project has agreed to collaborate with the School Completion Programme in the area with a view to integrating their model in order to avoid duplication and to provide better coordination of services. An evaluation will be undertaken this year, with a view to determining how best to achieve this.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	733	Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible Students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses in the State. The Free Fees Initiative does not extend to postgraduate study in Ireland, however if a candidate qualifies for the means-tested maintenance grant he/she may have their fees paid up to the maximum fee limit. The maximum fee limit in respect of the 2007/2008 academic year is €6,110.The assessment of means under my Department's Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes is based on gross income from all sources, with specified social welfare and health service executive payments being excluded from the calculation.Under the schemes reckonable income includes income from: Employment/Pensions; Self Employment/Farming; Rent and income from Land/Property; Deposit/Investment Accounts; Maintenance Arrangements; Gifts/Inheritances and Disposal of Assets and Rights; Social Welfare /Health Service Executive payments in certain circumstances.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	737	Article 42.2 of the Constitution confers a constitutional right on parents to provide for the religious, moral, intellectual, social and physical education of children in their own homes or in private schools or in schools established or recognised by the State.The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 provides a major reformulation of the law in regard to all matters connected with school attendance and children's welfare in education. It provided for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board, a core function of which is to ensure that each child ‘‘attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education". Under section 14 of the Education (Welfare) Act, the NEWB is required to maintain a register of children receiving education in places other than a recognised school and this would extend to situations where parents are educating their children at home.A key aspect of the Education (Welfare) Act is that children receiving education in places other than recognised schools must be registered with the National Educational Welfare Board. Parents who choose to have their child educated in a place other than a recognised school must register with the Board, and the Board in turn must be satisfied that the child is receiving ‘‘a certain minimum education.''A Working Group of the Inspectorate of my Department has drawn up Guidelines for the Assessment of Education in Places Other Than Recognised Schools.A certain minimum education should: be suited to the age, ability, aptitude and personality of the child; be responsive to the child's individual needs, should take cognisance of the areas of learning that are of interest to the child, and should ensure that his/her personal potential is enhanced and not suppressed; address the immediate and prospective needs of the child, in the context of the cultural, economic and social environment; provide a reasonably balanced range of learning experiences, so that no one aspect of the child's learning is emphasised to the exclusion of others; develop the personal and social skills of the child and prepare him/her for the responsibilities of citizenship; contribute to the moral development of the child; ensure the development of basic skills (as outlined below) so as to prepare the child to participate in society and everyday life; provide opportunities for the child to develop his/her intellectual capacities and understanding.A parent must apply to the NEWB to have his or her child registered and the application must be made in writing and set out the place where the child is receiving the education and must comply with requirements that may be set out in any Regulations made by the Minister for Education and Science or that may be developed by the NEWB with the Minister's approval at any time.The act provides that, initially, the National Educational Welfare Board will carry out, in consultation with the parent who made the application, an assessment of: (a) the education that is being provided, or that it is proposed will be provided, to the child; (b) the materials used, or that it is proposed will be used, in the provision of such education; and (c) the time spent, or that is proposed will be spent, in the provision of such education.The purpose of this assessment is to determine whether the child is receiving, or will receive, a certain minimum education.Our Constitution recognises the family as the primary educator of the child and defines duties and responsibilities for parents and the State in the education of children. Drawing on these provisions, on legislation, and on case law, the Guidelines for the Assessment of Education in Places Other Than Recognised Schools provide a working definition of ‘‘a certain minimum education'' and guidance on how this may be assessed, given best educational practice and the nature of educational provision in the home and other settings.In relation to the specific question raised concerning the number of private schools that were assessed or who contacted the NEWB in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in Dublin south east. I am informed by the NEWB that the data available are in respect of Dublin South and cover the years from 2004 to 2008, inclusive. The total requests for assessments amounted to 21 i.e. 3, 16, 1 and 1 respectively for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.  The total number of private schools that contacted the Board for this region during the same timeframe was 26 i.e. 22, 1, 0 and 3 for each year respectively. The variance can be explained in that completed applications are awaited for three of these contacts and the remaining two are awaiting assessment at this time.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 443 together.The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resources to schools to support children with special educational needs. The SENO is also a focal point of contact for parents and schools and their role includes identifying appropriate school placements.Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie or by telephone at 046 9486400.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the matter of the enrolment of a pupil in a school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	740	While the specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available, the two recent investment priorities under the ICT in Schools Programme have been the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme.Schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants in excess of €23m have since issued to schools.The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government /IBEC — TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of €30m.Grants have also been provided to some 500 post-primary schools to enable them to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level, with effect from September 2007.Disadvantaged schools are benefiting from the ICT Grant scheme for DEIS Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.ICT funding has also been provided under the school building programme in connection with designated school building projects and primary schools can purchase ICT equipment from the monies received under the Minor Works Grant Scheme.While the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably, I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience of our students. The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools ICT Strategy, which will be underpinned by the investment of €252m as provided for in the National Development Plan 2007-2013. I appointed a Strategy Planning Group to advise me on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment over the period of the NDP. Among the issues which the new strategy will address are the upgrading and renewal of hardware, the provision of software and digital content for learning, teacher professional development, curriculum development, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools and technical maintenance and support requirements.  I have received the report of the Strategy Planning Group and I will shortly be publishing the report, together with my implementation plan.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. Progress on the project will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	742	Because of the difficulty in sourcing a green field site the Department decided to investigate the possibility of utilising the Rossa College site to facilitate the proposed building project. To this end a feasibility study of the site and building was commissioned in order to determine how best to provide for the long-term accommodation needs of the proposed school.  However, because of the opposition from the Trustees of the proposed new Community School to the Rossa College site, this option is no longer being pursued. The Department will continue to work to identify a suitable site for this project and will keep the Trustees informed of progress in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	743	As the Deputy may be aware, the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. Since then, over 3,000 projects in primary and post-primary schools costing in excess of €300 million have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. The emphasis will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects. There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the building programme this year.The question of reintroducing the Summer Works Scheme will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2009 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	744	The development of the proposed building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	745	My Department does not regulate the provision of private colleges. Indeed, in the context of a lifelong approach to learning, it would not be feasible to confine all provision of education and training to providers which are nationally accredited.  However, in Ireland we do have a national framework of qualifications which enables providers in public, private, workplace or community settings to offer recognised awards in further or higher education, in compliance with the processes set out by the Further Education and Training Awards Council or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. Such providers must agree their quality assurance arrangements with the relevant awards council, and satisfy the council that the awards are of an appropriate standard, the necessary supports are in place for learners and the assessment arrangements are fair and consistent. There are also procedures under which international or professional bodies may seek to have their programmes aligned with or included in the national framework of qualifications in Ireland, if they wish to do so.  My Department is also bound by the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications to give appropriate recognition to nationally accredited awards from other jurisdictions. In addition to this, the Department maintains an Internationalisation Register containing programmes which are approved for the purpose of access to work by students who are citizens from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Only programmes which have been quality assured and/or lead to recognised qualifications are included on the Register.  Both the Internationalisation Register and a list of approved higher education providers are maintained on the Department's website.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy is not included on the Internationalisation Register, and does not currently offer programmes recognised by FETAC or HETAC under the national framework of qualifications. It is understood that an application has been made by the organisation to HETAC, and this is being examined at present. Internationally, many countries are grappling with how best to maintain an appropriate balance between ensuring that opportunities for ongoing learning in a variety of settings are encouraged, and that learners are not misled regarding the status or recognition attached to institutions and their awards. The Department is in consultation with the awards councils and the National Qualifications Authority as to how best such issues may be addressed. Learners are advised to check the recognition of their award before paying fees or beginning a programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	747	Since its commencement in 1998, there has been significant investment generally in the ICT in Schools Programme, in providing computers to schools, professional development ICT courses for teachers, improving the availability of digital content, integrating ICT into the curriculum and in supporting schools to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning. The recent priorities under the Programme have been the development of schools' internal networking facilities and the provision of broadband connectivity for schools, which my Department has pursued in partnership with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation within IBEC. Other recent developments include the introduction of the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level which were introduced this year with associated investment to schools to upgrade their facilities. Disadvantaged schools are also benefiting from the ICT Grant scheme for DEIS Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.  My Department does not have details of the number of post-primary schools with dedicated classrooms; however, there has been considerable progress since the Programme commenced. The number of computers in schools has increased substantially. In this regard, the latest available Census undertaken by the NCTE in 2005, found that at post-primary level, there was one computer for every 7 students.   While the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably, I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience for our young people. Our Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools ICT Strategy. This strategy will be underpinned by the investment of €252m in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.

Boards of Management must make every effort, including advertising in a national newspaper, to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for appointment to a temporary or permanent post.In relation to plans to increase the numbers of qualified science teachers, the Deputy may be aware that the Teaching Council's database of registered teachers will be able to provide a range of different information on the numbers of registered teachers in various disciplines and on their qualifications. This information will provide valuable input into my Department's examination of issues around supply and demand for teachers of various subjects, and we will make plans accordingly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	749	As part of the multi-annual school building programme my Department has invested heavily in modernising school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of many school building projects at post-primary level. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences. My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories. In the 2006/2007 applications schools were asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration could be given to approving these projects. Over 60 schools were approved for funding in 2006/2007 under the Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.

It is not unusual for the teacher support services operated by my Department to collaborate from time to time with outside organisations on imaginative initiatives which make available quality and relevant resources which enhance teaching and learning.Should a similar request arise in future, my Department will consider the distribution of materials with regard to curriculum relevance and budgetary issues.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	751	Two copies of the Judging Dev book were sent to all post primary schools in the country. Acknowledgements of receipt of the book were not requested and have not been received, although feedback from teachers attending in service in History has been positive. The book was packaged by staff in my Department and distributed through the Department's normal postal service.

The progression of all major projects to tender and construction, including this project, will be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of my Department's Multi Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I am aware of the joint communication from the patron bodies to An Taoiseach in relation to funding pressures on schools. I would like to assure the Deputy that it is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil. As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008. This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.I agree that increases in primary capitation must be a priority and that is why we are committed to doubling it by 2012. This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment I delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008. I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.

The progression of all school building projects will be considered in this context.I announced recently a list of schools which are due to go to construction in 2008. I intend to make further announcements regarding projects that will be proceeding to construction during the course of the year as the school building programme is rolled out. The next announcement will occur after Easter.

Since that pilot project took place, energy-saving enhancements to the building have been carried out, including the replacement of windows and it is planned to increase the insulation in 2008, which it is hoped will improve the overall energy efficiency of the building.This year, all of my Department's main offices in Dublin and Galway, and the Civil Defence Board's Offices in Roscrea, will be involved in the OPW's Energy Conservation Initiative in State Buildings, which aims to reduce CO2 emissions in all targeted state buildings by 15%.  We hope to achieve this reduction through raising staff awareness of the potential savings that can be made by changing our habits and behaviours to reduce our energy consumption to the benefit of all.

It may interest the Deputy to know that in the last few weeks, 8 of the direct provision accommodation centres contracted to the RIA received the EIQA Quality Mark.  The Deputy will recognise the extent of this achievement and the work required to reach and maintain, on a continuous basis, the standards required under this national quality award.  Furthermore, the terms and conditions set out in Memoranda of Agreement with accommodation providers encompass extensive and vigorous legislative and other quality standards which must be adhered to.In relation to costs, the RIA monitors all costs associated with its accommodation portfolio to ensure the best value for money while maintaining a high standard of service.  The RIA is always mindful of the need to spend taxpayers' money in the most appropriate way in fulfilling the State's obligations set out by the UNHCR (Geneva Convention).  The RIA is satisfied that it consistently achieves quality and value for money through the checks and balances which ensure quality of service, combined with the value for money reflected in the competitive price achieved by the RIA over a number of years in its operation of the direct provision system.

The person in question was notified by letter recently.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	758	I have been advised by my officials that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was first received in the Citizenship section of my Department on 14 March 2007. However, as there was an error on the statutory declaration, the form was returned to the person in question on 6 April 2007 so that it could be amended.I understand that the letter was delivered to the wrong address as a result of which the person in question was unable to return the amended form until September 2007. I wish to reassure both the Deputy and individual that processing of his application will not be delayed and that the application will be dealt with as if it had been received in March 2007.Officials in the Citizenship section are currently processing applications received in mid 2005 and have approximately 10,500 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned. These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in or around September 2009.I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.

The concern was based on newspaper reports on how the Directive might be transposed. Shortly afterwards, that person was on a delegation of telephony operators and internet service providers that was addressed by a Departmental representative on plans for the transposition of the Directive.I would like to emphasise that the date for transposition of the Directive has passed. My plans for transposition are at an advanced stage but no final decisions have yet been taken on aspects of the Directive where we have some flexibility. Through our obligations under the Treaty establishing the European Communmity, we are bound to transpose the Directive along with the other 26 Member States of the European Union and the members of the European Economic Area.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I propose to take Questions Nos. 465 to 467, inclusive, together.One of the strategic goals set out in the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy 2007-2009 is to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  One of the actions identified in the Garda Policing Plan 2008 in support of this goal is targeted intelligence-led operations against offending young drivers.I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of initiatives to target the activities of young male drivers are being undertaken.  Specific areas identified as places where young drivers congregate are targeted. As a result, uniform members of An Garda Síochána, supported by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel, establish checkpoints and enforce in a highly visible manner the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.These initiatives have resulted in detections being made for a wide range of road traffic offences, including offences relating to dangerous driving, careless driving, no silencer fitted, L plates not displayed, identification plates not conforming with legislation, road tax offences, insurance and driving licence offences, speeding offences, dangerously defective vehicles and modified vehicles. Offences detected are dealt with by way  of prosecution, fixed charge notice or, where appropriate, through the Juvenile Diversion Programme. In  2006 and 2007 over 100 offenders were charged before the local district courts.In addition to these intelligence-led operations, all uniform members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing the relevant legislative provisions. Regular mobile patrols take place and roving checkpoints are conducted in areas where young drivers tend to congregate.In addition websites are monitored so as to establish  where  such anti-social activities are taking place with a view to providing an appropriate response. Garda road safety awareness programmes are conducted in schools, third level colleges, factories, workplaces and other facilities, with the aim of educating road users of the obligations on all road users under the Road Traffic Acts and to promote road safety among the target group.The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 set out the legislative basis for prosecution due to excessive noise levels of vehicles. Current permissible sound levels are set by EU Directive.I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are currently reviewing the suitability of various sound meters which will meet the specifications for sound measuring devices set out in Directive 92/97/EEC with a view to improving the collection of the technical evidence necessary for the prosecution of drivers whose vehicles produce excessive levels of noise.Any changes to road traffic legislation, including the introduction of new penalties, is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport.

The Immigration Operations Division of my Department issued an acknowledgement of this application and request for documentation on 26 February 2008.Applications of this kind, in fairness to all other applicants, are dealt with in strict chronological order and currently take up to twelve months to process.   It should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.

This application was refused as the person concerned did not meet the criteria of the scheme.Judgments of the Supreme Court on matters related to the IBC/05 Scheme  were delivered on 20th December, 2007.  My Department is currently considering those judgments, and the person concerned will be written to shortly in this regard

Due to the location where the incident occurred the collision is also being investigated by the Railway Safety Commission.Local Garda management is aware of the concerns referred to by the Deputy. These matters have been discussed with the family of the deceased. A Garda liaison sergeant has been appointed to liaise with the family.

Local Garda Management report that one Garda has transferred out of Carrick-On-Suir Garda Station.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí is due to take place on 13 March next.  In that regard, the needs of Carrick-on-Suir Garda Station will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

The Department of Foreign Affairs provides this assistance through its network of Embassies and consulates.   I understand that in the particular case referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs has in fact provided extensive assistance to the next of kin.Insofar as the question of funding legal services is concerned, the position is that neither the Criminal nor Civil Legal Aid Scheme provides for representation for the next of kin of victims during the course of a criminal investigation or prosecution.  Furthermore, neither provides for representation to Irish nationals involved in legal proceedings taking place wholly outside of the State.  While I have great sympathy for the family in question, any such service under the Civil or Criminal Legal Aid schemes would require the introduction of new legislation.

The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.I would also like to refer the Deputy to a service for TDs and Senators concerning the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  This service, which is operated by the Property Registration Authority, is available all year round.I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the Property Registration Authority for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.

I am further informed that local Garda management is aware of issues raised by local residents regarding the premises in question.  The premises has a public dance licence and the area in which it is located receives particular attention from Garda mobile and foot patrols.The Garda authorities continue to liaise with local residents and any complaint made will be acted upon at the annual licensing courts or when an application is received for special exemptions.  This option is also available to residents in the area.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

They have not been commenced due to an ongoing process of consultation with shooting interest groups and An Garda Síochána regarding their implementation. Section 40 relates to reloading and has not been commenced due to Departmental concerns regarding its implementation.
Sections 101(10), 101(12)(c), 102, 103(1)(d), 103(4)(d), 107, 108(4), 109, 111, 112 are enabling provisions for electronic monitoring and there are no immediate plans to introduce this.

The Act requires that where appointments are made on a recommendation of the Board notice of that fact shall be published in Iris Oifigiúil.The provisions of section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 — dealing with the submission of names to the Minister by the JAAB — do not apply where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint to judicial office a person who is already a judge of the High Court, Circuit Court, District Court or who is eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court or the High Court by virtue of their membership of a specified international court.  Persons so appointed are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the above list.  The appointment of a judge of the High Court as Chairperson of the Commission to inquire into Child Abuse was on the basis directly of a nomination by the Government.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in September 2006.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned.  Each case is considered in the context of its own individual circumstances and merits; and statistics are not maintained as to the duration of the consideration  process in respect of each application, as no two applications are the same.The numbers granted Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and the numbers in respect of whom Deportation Orders were signed over the past 30 months are set out in the table below:Numbers Granted Leave to Remain***Numbers in respect of whom Deportation Orders have been signed

The number of asylum seekers in RIA accommodation can change on a day to day basis.  At 31 December 2007, 6,625 asylum seekers were being accommodated.  In 2007, the total amount paid by the RIA in respect of board and accommodation was €79.084 million.Based on these figures, it is possible to estimate a mean average cost of board and accommodation of €11,937 per asylum seeker per year.  This figure covers accommodation in direct provision centres as well as a small number of self-catering facilities.  It does not include pre-school costs, costs in relation to a number of utility services in some State-owned centres, transportation costs in respect of dispersal of asylum seekers, payments to the Health Service Executive in respect of separated children seeking asylum and some miscellaneous payments.The rate of the Weekly Supplementary Welfare Payment to Asylum Seekers is €19.10 in respect of adults and €9.60 in respect of each individual child per week.  In relation to the cost of medical and other services, the latest information available is for 2006 and is detailed in the following paragraphs.The Department of Health and Children reports expenditure of €9.09m in the areas of General Practitioner services and drugs, medical screening and maternity services.  According to that Department, no distinction is made in relation to costs incurred in the provision of maternity and medical screening services to asylum seekers and other non-Irish nationals.The Department of Education and Science reports expenditure of €48.14m in the provision of additional resources to primary and secondary schools attended by non-national children with significant English-language difficulties.  The details supplied make no distinction between the children of asylum seekers and those of other non-nationals.The Department of Social and Family Affairs reports expenditure of €68.01m in respect of the provision of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Rent Supplement, exceptional needs payments, Child Benefit and Direct Provision.  With regard to the figures supplied by that Department concerning supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplement and exceptional needs payment, while the vast bulk of the expenditure relates to asylum seekers, there may be some expenditure attributable to other persons (e.g. former asylum seekers and persons granted refugee status).  In addition to the allowances mentioned, a number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other allowances such as unemployment assistance, disability, and one parent family allowances.The Office of Public Works reports expenditure of €0.41m in 2006 under the general heading of construction and maintenance of properties.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office reports expenditure of €2.01m incurred through payments made to Counsel defending asylum proceedings.  My Department incurred expenditure of €7.73m in respect of the provision of refugee legal services and €52.21m, representing the total cost of running the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, which includes services across the asylum and immigration areas.

The length of time taken to process asylum applications differs depending on whether an applicant is dealt with under prioritised arrangements or not.  With effect from the 25 January 2005, new arrangements for the speedier processing of applications from certain countries were implemented.  These arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Croatia and South Africa.  They also applied to Romania and Bulgaria prior to their accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.The Office of the Refugee Applications CommissionerIn terms of the average timescales to process Prioritised cases at first instance, an interview date is usually scheduled within 9-12 working days from the date of the initial application.  These applications are normally finalised within a further 5-8 working days, giving an average processing time of 17-20 working days from the date of application.  In the case of Non-prioritised cases, an interview date is usually scheduled approximately 16-18 weeks from the date of the initial application.  These applications are normally finalised within a further 4-5 weeks, giving a total processing time of 20 -23 weeks from the date of application.Some cases will take significantly longer to complete for example due to medical reasons, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  Some cases are also more complex than others with applicants coming from over 90 different countries.  ORAC continues to schedule applicants for interview on the date of application unless there are medical or other compelling reasons.The Refugee Applications Commissioner continues to keep the procedure for processing applications for refugee status in that Office under ongoing review with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation to be made, without compromising on applicants rights to a fair and balanced examination of their case.The Refugee Appeals TribunalThe average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Substantive appeals is 21 weeks.  The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Accelerated appeals (appeals on papers only) is 8 weeks.  The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete appeals for Prioritised cases is 9 weeks.While many appeals are completed in a shorter time span than above, many factors such as adjournments, postponements, judicial reviews and requests by legal representatives for access to previous Tribunal decisions can impede the Tribunal from completing cases earlier.  High quality, consistent and fair decision making in all cases continues to be a high priority in the Tribunal.Improvements in Processing TimescalesThe Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner has made significant progress in the processing of asylum applications since the creation of the office in November 2000.  In November 2000, when the ORAC was established, there were over 9,400 applications awaiting decision at first instance.  As at the 31st January 2008, there were 1,272 outstanding applications awaiting a recommendation by ORAC.  Of these, only 171 cases were on hands over 6 months.The RAT has also made significant progress in the processing of asylum applications since the creation of the office in November 2000.  Prior to the establishment of the RAT, substantive appeals took on average 36 weeks to complete.  As already indicated, the average processing timescale for substantive cases is 21 weeks and 9 weeks for prioritised cases.As at the 31st January 2008, there were 3,221 appeals outstanding in the Tribunal.  Of these 3,221 outstanding appeals, 2,007 were on hands over six months.  A large volume of the appeals outstanding more than 6 months in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is due to the delay in processing appeals pending the granting of access to Tribunal Decisions following the Supreme Court judgement (in the Atanasov case) on the matter.  Following the judgement the RAT set up a comprehensive data bank of previous decisions of the Tribunal, suitably redacted, which is readily available for access by legal representatives of applicants.  This data bank, along with other measures being applied by RAT, will be of considerable assistance in clearing the current backlog of cases.

The RIA provides full direct provision accommodation in the majority of its accommodation centres but has a limited supply of ‘self-catering' accommodation such as that provided at Station House apartments, Ballaghaderreen.The person referred to applied for asylum on 8 April, 2004.  She is one of a family of four, comprising 2 parents and 2 children.  She was provided with accommodation at Station House apartments in October, 2006 along with her eldest child.  Her husband joined her at a later date and their youngest child was born while at her current accommodation.I am informed that the RIA received a transfer request from this family on 5 February, 2008.  The transfer request raises a specific issue in respect of school access which the RIA is investigating as part of its overall consideration of the case.  Additional correspondence associated with the request refers to the necessity to share facilities, such as a kitchen and bathroom, with other residents in the centre.  The sharing of such facilities is a normal feature of much of the self-catering accommodation available to RIA.A considered response will issue directly to the person concerned in due course but it should be noted that any transfer to alternative self-catering accommodation would also involve the sharing of facilities.  Moreover, RIA has a very limited supply of such self-catering accommodation and, if the request is to be facilitated at all, it may be in a position to offer only normal direct provision accommodation to this family.  This would involve the family living in full-board accommodation with no access to a kitchen and a return to direct provision allowance payments.

The person concerned and her three children arrived in the State on 31 May 2005 and applied for asylum on 8 June 2005.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 May 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  In relation to Subsidiary Protection, my Department's records show that, to date, no application for Subsidiary Protection, in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations (S.I. No. 518 of 2006), has been received from or on behalf of the person concerned.

This priority has been incorporated into the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 by the Garda Commissioner who has set a target for its development later this year.  Officials of my Department are engaged with both the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate on preparatory work in this regard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The 2008 Policing Priorities for the Garda Síochána, which I set earlier this year under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, provide for enhanced activity by the Garda Drugs Unit and by gardaí generally focusing in particular on places where drug dealing and the use of illicit drugs is likely.  The Garda has been targeting places of this kind and it intends to intensify that activity.  Its efforts in this regard are underpinned by its extensive search powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.  Section 23 of the 1977 Act allows a member of the Garda Síochána with reasonable cause to suspect that a person is in possession of a controlled drug, to search without warrant that person, and any vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which he suspects that such drugs may be found.  Section 27 of the same Act empowers a member of the Garda who has reasonable grounds for suspicion to apply to a District Court judge or a peace commissioner for a warrant to enter particular premises and search them.  Section 8 of the 1996 Act makes provision for a Garda superintendent to issue such a search warrant in cases of urgency.  The search powers referred to above are in addition to the general powers in relation to search warrants which are set out in section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, as amended by section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  I am aware that any significant extension of Garda search powers beyond those already available gives rise to consideration of highly sensitive issues, including ones of constitutional importance.  In this regard I am thinking, for example, of Article 40.3 (personal rights) and 40.5 (inviolability of a dwelling) of the Constitution.  I am therefore approaching the commitment in the Government Programme with those considerations in mind.  My aim is that any new powers will be capable of withstanding Constitutional scrutiny.  As the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved I am unable to say at this stage when proposals will be available.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	797	My Department has been engaged in extensive correspondence over the last number of years in relation to the question of Irish citizenship for the three individuals concerned and the broader issue of Irish citizenship for Argentinian nationals of Irish descent.  The great-grandchildren of people born in Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship by registering in the Foreign Births Register provided either of their parents had at the time of their birth acquired Irish citizenship through registration in the Foreign Births Register.  There is one exception to that rule.  If one parent had registered in the Foreign Births Register prior to 31 December 1986, their child can register if the parent had not registered at the time of that person's birth.  If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation.  Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956-2004.  The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements including requirements in relation to residency.  However, I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances — for example, where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law.   The three people referred to in the Deputy's question lodged applications for naturalisation in 2002.  Having considered all of the information available at that time, the three applications were refused.  It is, of course, open to the individuals to apply again for naturalisation at any time in the future.  Any such applications will be considered in the context of the legislation in force at that time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	798	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's question was received in the Citizenship section of my Department in August 2007.  Officials in that section are processing applications received in mid-2005 and have approximately 14,200 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned.  These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the first half of 2010.  I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.  I share the Deputy's concerns that the existing processing time of 30 months for applications for certificates of naturalisation is excessive but this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of such applications received in the last number of years.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  The procedures involved in the processing of applications have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.  I have recently allocated additional resources to the Citizenship section of my Department so that several categories of applicant can be dealt with more expeditiously than at present.  These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and applications made on behalf of minors.

This is borne out by the large number of successful prosecutions annually for simple possession of controlled drugs and by the significant seizures of cannabis made by the Garda authorities, €11.72 million (provisional figures) so far this year.  Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 provides that possession of a controlled drug (which includes cannabis and cannabis resin) is a criminal offence.  Section 27 of the 1977 Act as amended by section 6 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 sets out the maximum penalties for this offence and in doing so draws a distinction between cannabis and cannabis resin and any other controlled drugs.  Section 27(1) sets out a tiered system of penalties where the relevant controlled drug is cannabis or cannabis resin and the court is satisfied that the person was in possession of the controlled drug for his or her personal use.  The system of penalties is as follows:Summary convictionConviction on indictmentFirst offenceFine not exceeding €380.92 (£300)Fine not exceeding €634.87 (£500)Second offenceFine not exceeding €507.90  (£400)Fine not exceeding €1,269.74 (£1,000)Third or subsequent offenceFine not exceeding €1,269.74 (£1,000) and / or  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 monthsFine  and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 yearsI will draw the Deputy's comments to the attention of  my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, who has primary responsibility for the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.

To facilitate this, the Garda authorities have introduced policy and practices which reflect best international practice for the management and use of intelligence sources.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to comment on the specifics of the operation of the arrangements for managing intelligence sources.  To do otherwise could potentially adversely affect ongoing and future Garda operations.  I can confirm, however, that in dealing with persons who willingly assist the Garda Síochána in the investigation of criminal activity, the Garda authorities operate strictly within the parameters of the law.  In this regard, where an offence is disclosed, every person without exception is subject to investigation, and it is then a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether proceedings should be commenced.

While I have no proposal to raise this age limit, a claim to have it extended to 63 for superintendents and chief superintendents has been lodged with the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Council.  The official side will of course discuss this claim and its implications, including its implications for career development and progression within the Force and the favourable early retirement terms currently available to all members.

Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 18 August 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted and a Garda response embraces intelligence-led operations primarily undertaken by An Garda Siochana specialised units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drug Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition information relating to these groupings is disseminated on a regular basis to Europol at The Hague.An Garda Síochána maintains liaison with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe, and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish criminals living abroad. This ongoing liaison has led to a number of successful joint operations, targeting attempted importations of drugs and firearms, resulting in a number of significant arrests here and in other Jurisdictions. Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available, law enforcement agencies in other Jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, to prevent and detect such criminality. To facilitate cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, An Garda Síochána has posted Liaison Officers to a number of centres throughout Europe.Where information exists that a person who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction is living abroad, and where the particular legal requirements apply, extradition is sought or application is made for a European Arrest Warrant.Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crime.  A member of An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.Ireland is a party to various International Conventions which provide for assistance in criminal matters between jurisdictions. An Garda Síochána send and receive requests for assistance via the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Requests for Assistance may also be dealt with on the basis of reciprocity where certain jurisdictions may not be a party to specific conventions.

Where information exists that a person, who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction, is living abroad and where the particular legal requirements apply, surrender of the person from the relevant Member State of the European Union or extradition from the relevant country are sought in accordance with the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant 2003 as amended or Part II of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended.Currently there are 63 active requests for surrender in accordance with the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 as amended.  Since the coming into operation of this Act on 1 January 2004, 63 persons have been surrendered to Ireland on foot of outgoing European Arrest Warrants.There are also 4 ongoing extradition requests in accordance with Part II of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended.  In addition to the above there are 8 outstanding extradition requests to the United Kingdom under Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended.  Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended has been repealed and there have been no Part III requests to the United Kingdom since 2003.

In the case of non-scheduled offences, such persons can be returned for trial to the SCC upon direction of the DPP.  The SCC has already been used in a number of serious non-paramilitary cases.  Issues relating to the operation of the SCC in such circumstances are kept under review.

The responsibilities of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform include ensuring adequate funding for all parts of the criminal justice system, including the courts. In this regard, I am pleased to say that €107 million is provided for the Courts Service in 2008, an increase of 5% on 2007.Since its establishment, the Service has been extremely successful in transforming the courts system in this State. It is continuing the major programme of work to provide modern 21st century court buildings to all parts of the country.  The allocation for Capital works on courthouses this year stands at nearly €30 million.A new state-of-the-art Criminal Courts Complex in Dublin is being constructed in Parkgate Street and is due for completion in 2010.  The building involves the transfer of all Dublin criminal courts and administrative offices from three jurisdictions — District, Circuit and Central — to the new facility and will concentrate all central Dublin criminal business in one serviced location with 22 new courtrooms.  This will also mean that the Four Courts will be ‘freed' up for civil business.  This development will reduce delays across all the court lists and transform the facilities available to court users, including jury panels and victims.Last year, courthouse building and refurbishment projects were completed in Tullamore, Bray, Fermoy, Belmullet and in Dolphin House (Dublin). This year, I am advised that projects will be completed in Ardee, Thurles, Clones, Blanchardstown and Gorey. Work will commence in 2008 in Kilkenny, Monaghan, Mullingar, Swinford, Manorhamilton, Wexford, Kilmallock, Killaloe, Youghal and Virginia.

This compares with a figure of 2,723 persons in the prison system on 20 May, 1996 of whom 536 (almost 20%) were on temporary release.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the reason for the significant fall in the percentage of prisoners on temporary release between 1996 and 2008 is because this Government has provided some 1,200 additional prison spaces since 1997.  Having said that there will always be a small percentage of prisoners on temporary release at any given time.Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be reduced by planned reintegration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made on temporary release applications.Prisoners are considered for temporary release in various circumstances, for example, release under the direct supervision of the Probation Service; to employment or training programmes; on compassionate release because of ill health or family related circumstances; or for reintegration purposes because they are nearing the end of their sentence.In relation to the Deputy's request for details of the nature of the offence in respect of each person on temporary release, the compilation of such statistics would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and expense to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, as already stated, the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made on temporary release applications.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	811	I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that An Garda Siochana, in accordance with the priorities determined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pursuant to Section 20 of the Garda Siochana Act, 2005/07, is committed to targeting organised criminal groups engaged in serious crime and those who facilitate the activities of these groupings.The Garda Siochana Policing Plan 2008 sets out strategic goals which include a commitment to significantly reduce the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in the trafficking of illegal drugs, guns and immigrants into and within the State. Witness intimidation and the laundering of money are integral parts of these Organised Criminal Groups activities and will be targeted as part of the overall strategy against these groups.Where information comes into the possession of An Garda Síochána indicating the involvement of criminals in the type of activity suggested in the question it is subject to thorough investigation.  Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crime.  A member of An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.In November 2005 the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation was set up to combat the growth of Organised Crime and in particular armed criminal groups.  This Unit has been made permanent since January 2008 and has 70 members working proactively targeting the various criminal groups.The Unit will continue to work closely with other specialist units, including the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Special Detective Unit / Emergency Response Unit, in targeting those suspected of involvement in organised criminal activity. The Organised Crime Unit has identified and profiled suspects associated with the main criminal gangs. Where there is evidence of this type of criminal activity the matter is fully investigated and an Investigation File is submitted to the Law Enforcement Officers.A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently with firearms recovered and drugs seized resulting in a number of people, from these organised groups, being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.The intimidation of witnesses is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 41 specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda Síochána, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The offence applies to the intimidation of witnesses, jurors or potential jurors or any member of these persons' families.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.Since 1997, the Garda Síochána has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by complementary legislative provisions in Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 40 makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.The Garda Síochána rigorously and conscientiously enforces the provisions relating to witness intimidation and protection contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  In particular, where the possibility of intimidation of witnesses may be an issue, the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has the discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.  Any such incident would also be the subject of a thorough investigation by the Garda Síochána with a view to seeking directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí is due to take place on 13 March next.  In that regard, the needs of Garda Stations throughout County Kildare will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations and Divisions throughout the country.The opening hours for each station in the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division are as set out in the table hereunder:StationMon-FriSatSunNaas24hr24hr24hrCelbridge10am-6pm, 7pm-9pm10am-6pm, 7pm-9pm12md-2pmClane10am-1pm10am-1pm12md-2pmKill10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmMaynooth10am-1pm, 2pm-6pm, 7pm-9pm10am-1pm12md-2pmKildare24hr24hr24hrRobertstown10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmKilcullen10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmMonasterevin10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmNewbridge24hr24hr24hrRathangan10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmCarbury10am-1pm10am-1pm10am-1pmCarlow24hr24hr24hrLeighlinbridge10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pmBallon10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pmMyshall10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pmMuinebheag10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pmAthy9am-10pm9am-10pm9am-10pmCastledermot10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pm10am-1pm, 6pm-7.30pmBaltinglass24hr24hr24hrBlessington10am-1pm10am-1pm11am-1pmDunlavin3pm-5pm3pm-5pmClosedHollywood8pm-10pm8pm-10pmClosedDonard11am-1pm11am-1pmClosedShillelagh11am-1pm11am-1pmClosedTinahely3pm-5pm3pm-5pmClosedHacketstown11am-1pm11am-1pmClosedRathvilly3pm-5pm3pm-5pmClosedBallymore Eustace2pm-4pm2pm-4pmClosedTullow10am-1pm10am-1pm11am-1pmBallytoreMon,Wed, Frid: 7pm-9pm, Tue: 3pm-5pm7pm-9pmClosedOutside of these hours, the call diversion system and Public Access Call Box (P.A.C.B) are in operation and linked to the District Headquarters. Opening hours of non 24 hour Garda Stations are dependent on manpower availability on a daily basis.An increase in the opening hours of these Stations would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.I recently approved the 2008 Garda Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner's proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is a plan to establish a new Garda Division in Kildare. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda Síochána to implement these planned changes for various Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.

An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.An Garda Síochána utilises intelligence-led operations to target organised crime gangs.  All available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units to target particular groups.  Organised Crime is being targeted on a number of fronts, involving Gardaí overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of criminal activities. Specialist units from National Support Services are also assisting in these operations and deal with the different aspects of this type of criminal activity. A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently with firearms recovered and drugs seized resulting in a number of people, from these organised groups, being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.In November 2005 the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation was set up to combat Organised Crime and in particular armed criminal groups.  This Unit now comprises of 70 members working proactively targeting the various criminal groups throughout the city. In January of this year the Commissioner announced the establishment of this unit on permanent basis. At present an evaluation of the unit structure and its remit is being undertaken.The Unit will continue to work closely with other specialist units, including the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Special Detective Unit / Emergency Response Unit, in targeting those suspected of involvement in organised criminal activity. The Organised Crime Unit has identified and profiled suspects associated with the main criminal groups. Where there is evidence of this type of criminal activity the matter is fully investigated and an Investigation File is submitted to the Law Officers.Operation ‘Anvil' commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 and was expanded regionally during 2006. It is an intelligence-led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity, through extensive additional overt patrolling, static checkpoints, by uniform mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols, in conjunction with other, covert, operations.The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is also closely involved in Operation ‘Anvil', particularly within the DMR. This operation has also successfully targeted a number of criminal gangs involved in gun crime.  The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target assets accumulated by criminals, in order to seize such assets and to deprive the criminals of the profits of their criminal activity. The Garda National Drugs Unit liaises closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau to target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.

This project aims to conserve energy in State Buildings and has as its objective a 15% reduction of CO2 emissions in all of the targeted State Buildings.  The aim of the programme is to engage staff in all offices through a series of lectures, seminars and a poster campaign.  It is intended that regular reports will be circulated to all staff to update them on the latest initiatives under the plan and on energy use and savings achieved during the preceding period.In advance of this central initiative, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Services (INIS) Division of my Department, whose offices are in Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, have already introduced a voluntary energy saving initiative which began in July 2007.  The initiative has achieved substantial energy savings and has in fact been identified by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) as an example of organisation which has made unique energy savings.

This includes consideration of provisions in relation to the outward condition of private rented accommodation.  The level of penalties for offences in relation to the standards regulations will be kept under review; changes in that regard would involve amendment of primary legislation.In September 2006, a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation was announced, involving a range of measures including improved regulation, enforcement, funding and information.  Good progress is being made with this Programme. The number of inspections reported in 2006 was 9,835, which represented an increase of 36% on the 2004 figure of 7,232. The number of dwellings not meeting regulatory requirements fell by 19% over the same period, even though there was a significant increase in the number of inspections. It is not possible to calculate accurately the trend in the rate of inspections relative to the total number of rented units because definitive statistics for the total number of private rented dwellings in 2004 and 2006 are not available. Information is not available as to the number of inspections that may have been undertaken as a result of complaints by tenants, although a report published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007 points out that most local authorities receive very few complaints.Further information in relation to enforcement of the regulations relating to private rented housing, as reported by local authorities, is published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  Returns for 2007 have not yet been received from all local authorities, but those received to date indicate that there is likely to be further improvement in enforcement performance.The key element in ensuring good standards of local authority housing is the performance of local authorities in relation to maintenance and, where necessary, improvement of their housing stock. These are matters in respect of which local authorities have a significant degree of devolved responsibility and which are subject to oversight by the elected members of each individual authority.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	822	I propose to take Questions Nos. 541 to 543, inclusive, together.The provision of a fire service in a fire authority's functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of the individual fire authority under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.The Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the setting of general policy and the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme.In 2005, the Department approved an application from Kilkenny County Council to construct a replacement fire station in Castlecomer.  I understand the current position is that tenders in respect of this project have recently been submitted to Kilkenny County Council and are being assessed by the fire authority. When this assessment is completed, the council will submit a recommendation on the tender competition to the Department for approval.Applications for funding have been made to the Department for the construction of a replacement station at Urlingford and a two bay station in Graiguenamanagh.I understand the Department has recently written to Kilkenny County Council requesting it to rank these applications in order of priority.  The Department has also requested that the fire authority prepare and submit a capital appraisal in respect of both projects in line with the Department of Finance's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector.  Upon receipt of the additional documentation sought by the Department and an indication of the council's priorities, the projects will be considered in the context of future capital programmes.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	823	I propose to take Questions Nos. 544 and 545 together.The development plans of the relevant local authorities provide the primary land use protection policies for the Liffey Valley. In addition, parts of the Valley are already covered by special designations.  The area between Chapelizod and Lucan is protected by a Special Area Amenity Order, and part of the valley is designated as a proposed Natural Heritage Area.As indicated in the reply to Question No. 1357 of 30 January 2008, it is an objective of South Dublin County Council's current Development Plan to investigate the feasibility of extending the Special Amenity Area Order to further lands, including part or all of St Edmundsbury and Woodville lands. The extent and location of the land to be covered by any such Order would be affected by the measures required to give effect to the recommendation of the Affordable Homes Partnership to use lands at St Edmundsbury and Woodville for affordable housing.   In that regard, the County Council has progressed a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Development Plan variation recommendation, on foot of which I understand the matter is currently the subject of further discussions between the Partnership and the landowner concerned.The making available of additional lands for affordable housing is a matter of priority for the Government.  In that context, guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 were issued in August 2006 in support of the "Call for Lands" process.  The advancing of individual sites within the process is a matter for the Partnership, the promoters of individual proposals and the relevant local authority.Equally, the protection of the Liffey Valley which is a major amenity for the people of Dublin and the extension of the SAAO are objectives which I share.On the broader question of the provision of a national park in the Liffey Valley, the practice to date has been that only State lands are included in National Parks.  I will be considering this in relation to overall policy for National Parks as it applies throughout the country and I am eager to hear views on this matter from interested parties.

The programme involves not just the provision of central heating, but where necessary, measures to ensure the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  Since the programme's introduction in 2004, my Department has provided grants worth €94 million for the installation of central heating in some 19,600 local authority houses, with another €30 million available this year for a further 5,000 installations.Furthermore, in order to address fuel poverty among older people living in private houses in the Dublin area, my Department is currently operating a pilot scheme which provides for the installation of a central heating system, associated insulation works and energy advice.  The scheme involves up to 150 households in Ballyfermot, Whitehall and Crumlin, and is administered by Dublin City Council within the framework of the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.  My Department is also undertaking an independent evaluation of the benefits accruing from the pilot scheme and the associated impacts on the quality of life of older persons whose homes are properly heated and insulated.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	830	Record levels of case intake over successive years 2004 — 2006 and the assumption of significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 challenged An Bord Pleanála's ability to achieve its statutory objective. According to the Board's annual report for 2006, the 18-week statutory objective was met in 52% of all cases, compared to 78% in 2005.However, in recognition of the key role the Board plays in delivery of key local and national infrastructure and of the demands arising from sustained record levels of appeals over the recent years, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bringing the total complement to 172.As a result, I expect to see a significant improvement in the Board's performance levels in relation to its statutory objective targets during 2008.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission which will take responsibility for a range of electoral matters including the functions currently exercised by the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending; the Electoral Commission will also examine the issue of financing of the political system. In this regard, a procurement process is underway for the carrying out of preliminary research on issues arising in relation to the establishment of the Electoral Commission.In accordance with the Programme for Government, my Department will be publishing a Green Paper on local government reform shortly. The Green Paper will examine a number of issues with the objective of making local government more transparent and responsive, and will set out options for reform in advance of a subsequent White Paper.  One of the issues which the Green Paper will address is the question of expenditure limits at local elections.  There are currently no such limits, although expenditure, as well as donations over a €635 threshold, must be disclosed.

Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No.2) Regulations, 2007, a local authority is required to notify the Agency whenever a boil-water notice is issued in respect of a public water supply.   Details of such notifications may be obtained from the Agency.Information in relation to drinking water supplies generally is published by the Agency on an annual basis.  The Agency's most recent report "The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Years 2006-2007", and reports for previous years, are available in the Oireachtas Library.

In addition, a significant range of drinking water supply improvements are being implemented under the Rural Water Programme which is also funded by the Department. Responsibility for the operation of the Rural Water Programme has been devolved to county councils from whom information in relation to activity in their functional areas may be obtained.I have no proposals to privatise public water supplies. Section 31(12) of the Water Services Act, 2007, explicitly prohibits the transfer of water services assets to the private sector.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	843	Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter lies with local authorities, who are required to take all practicable measures for the prevention, control and disposal of litter in their functional areas.  My Department is in regular contact with local authorities in this regard.The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) provides annual information in relation to litter levels and causative factors, which enables ongoing monitoring of the situation by my Department.  The trends emerging from the NLPMS are generally positive and show a modest but steady reduction in litter levels; 60% of all areas surveyed in 2006 were either litter-free or slightly littered.A survey of the composition of litter on rural roads in six local authorities, carried out for the NLPMS in 2006, identified packaging items as the most significant component of litter in these areas.  My Department is currently in discussions with the ‘food on the go' sector aimed at negotiating a voluntary agreement to combat the incidence of food related litter of this kind.The National Roads Authority has no specific function in regard to litter management.

In that context, the housing authorities concerned have been requested to plan a social housing supply programme for that period on the basis of an indicative budget of €70m to €75m.My Department is due to meet the housing authorities concerned today, 4 March 2008, to discuss their Housing Action Plan and final allocations for 2008 will issue to individual housing authorities as soon as possible thereafter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	846	I propose to take Questions Nos. 569, 570 and 572 together.Legislation governing the regulation of management companies is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment being involved in relation to any company law aspects.As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I have overall responsibility for the legislative and policy framework governing the taking in charge of estates.  I have no function in relation to the taking in charge of particular estates as this is a matter for the relevant planning authority concerned.  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, requires planning authorities to commence taking in charge procedures in relation to residential developments, finished or unfinished, where certain conditions have been met.In addition to the legislative framework, and as set out in the reply to Question No. 19 of 27 February 2008, my Department has also issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on the taking in charge of estates in the form of circular letter PD 1/08.  Each planning authority is being asked to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008, on the basis of the framework, and wider housing and planning guidance, as set out in the annex to the circular.The circular letter also states that priority must continue to be given to resolving those estates that been left unfinished / not taken in charge for the longest period.

However, in discharging these responsibilities, authorities should have regard to the report — Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement — published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to such complaint procedures and inspection regimes.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	849	In accordance with its Environmental Policy Statement, my Department is fully committed to the conservation and effective management of our consumption of resources, including energy, waste, paper, equipment and other consumables.  This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001, in respect of our Headquarters in the Custom House.Through the OPW, my Department has a contract in place with Energia since October 2006 for the supply of electricity from renewable sources to the Department's main offices.  My Department has undertaken a number of energy consumption measures including installation of a Building Energy Management System in the Custom House enabling more efficient heating management, use of energy efficient lights, a powersave function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex facilities.  Under these measures total energy consumption in the Custom House has decreased by 6% between 2005 and 2007.  In collaboration with the OPW, my Department has set high environmental specifications for its proposed decentralised offices in the South East.  My Department is among the first Departments to participate in the recently launched OPW Optimising Power @ Work, Staff Energy Awareness Campaign.  This campaign, which will begin in the Department in early March, aims at achieving a minimum 15% reduction in total annual carbon dioxide emissions.  My Department has also participated in the Power of One and One Small Step campaigns.In line with the Programme for Government commitment on carbon offsetting official air travel, I am developing, and hope shortly to announce details of, a scheme for use by all Government Departments and bodies under their aegis.  I have, in the meantime, made separate arrangements to offset the air travel related to my attendance at the Ministerial segment of the ongoing meetings of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.Other measures taken in my Department to reduce emissions include promotion of public transport through implementation of a tax efficient Travel Pass Scheme, and the entire vehicle fleet of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is capable of running on biodiesel.  Arrangements are being put in place for the supply of biodiesel to the National Parks.  Furthermore, a proposal to utilise electric vehicles and bicycles in the National Parks is under consideration.  On the wider issue of nature conservation the rehabilitation of boglands, preservation of woodlands, and planned tree planting at NPWS sites is instrumental in reducing the national carbon footprint.Day to day operation of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the Agencies themselves.

We must fulfil our obligations under the Habitats Directive, namely to maintain or restore fish stocks to favourable conservation status.The cessation of mixed stock fishing for salmon was introduced for conservation reasons.  It is no longer tenable to indiscriminately harvest fish destined for rivers which are failing to meet their conservation limits.  For this reason the harvest of fish has been confined to the stocks of those rivers identified by the scientific advice as having a surplus.  The rivers meeting their Conservation Limit and for which a surplus of fish was identified for harvest in 2008, were specified in the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations published in 2007.The Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2007 also provide for the establishment of Fishery District Committees, which are representative of both commercial and recreational stakeholders, with whom the Chief Executive Officer of the Regional Fisheries Board will consult in allocating the opportunity to harvest the identified surplus in each river.Last year, and on foot of the cessation of mixed stock fishing for wild salmon, the Government put in place a €25m Salmon Hardship Scheme aimed at providing a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced based on their recent catch history.The management of the fishery in those rivers where a surplus has been identified and the question of how best to exploit that surplus is under active consideration by the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the relevant regional fisheries boards.  I expect to receive proposals in this regard from the CEOs in the near future, which I will consider in consultation with relevant scientific and other expertise.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas in County Mayo, and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.The first phase of the National Broadband Scheme procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008 and that implementation of services will commence as soon as possible thereafter.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.Service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre, standard telephone cable and mobile in Carrickmacross.  My Department operates a dedicated website, www.broadband.gov.ie where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.Subscriber numbers are collected by ComReg on a national rather than regional basis.  Ireland was ranked fifth cheapest for broadband, that is, for using a monthly rental ADSL basket, in the EU15 and is below the EU average.  Prices have fallen as more providers with varying offers via different technologies have entered the market.

The then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, committed €3.71m or 90% grant aid and Fingal County Council committed the remaining 10%, or €0.37m.  The total grant paid to date is €3.35m.  Construction commenced in these towns in February 2007 and was certified complete in November 2007.  All the networks are now available to service providers to provide high-speed access to end users in the towns referred to by the Deputy.

The elements of this review, aimed at significantly reducing carbon emissions, have already been agreed between my Department and the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The project involves re-commissioning and upgrading of Building Management Systems, reducing base energy loads, installing additional energy controls, reducing energy demands in high use areas, reducing solar gain in areas under significant glass cover.  OPW are assessing, as a priority, the feasibility of employing passive energy solutions on behalf of the Department.In addition, my Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works in implementing a wider energy conservation initiative aimed at enhancing energy efficiency in selected managed buildings. The OPW's programme, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 15%, includes my Department's buildings at Adelaide Road and Beggars Bush. This programme will run in parallel with the specific energy efficiency plan being put in place for the Adelaide Road complex.  The approach adopted will be to primarily focus on the changing of attitudes, behaviour and habits that requires a balanced approach to energy conservation tasks.A senior Official of my Department has met with the representative of the OPW appointed facilities management team and, given our energy brief, I am happy to inform the House that my Department wholeheartedly supports the OPW initiative and will be among the first Public Bodies to avail of the lectures/seminar element of the programme and to get the OPW programme up and running. The lectures are due to start in my Department this week.In addition, my Officials met recently with representatives of the OPW in relation to the finalisation of the specification for my Department's new headquarters building in Cavan to be provided under the Government's decentralisation programme. The issue of making the new building as energy efficient as possible in terms of promoting passive energy solutions and use of renewable energy and the promotion of energy efficiency in general was high on the list of priorities at these discussions.  State Agencies have access to OPW's expertise and to its energy efficiency programme, however the issue of energy efficiency for State Agencies is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies themselves in which I have no function.
