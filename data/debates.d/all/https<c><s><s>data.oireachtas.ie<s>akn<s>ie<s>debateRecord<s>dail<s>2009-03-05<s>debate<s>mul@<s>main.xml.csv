#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on the Deputies in the order in which their matters were submitted to the Ceann Comhairle's office.  I call Deputy Bannon.  As láthair.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Give him a chance.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I call Deputy Finian McGrath.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Will I wait for Deputy Bannon or proceed?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will move on if Deputy Finian McGrath is not available.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to support the ICTU's social solidarity pact as a way to resolve our economic crisis and to ensure that the burden is shared fairly across society where we prioritise the protection of people's jobs, pensions and homes, get the unemployed back to work and ensure that the weakest are protected.  That is an option for the Government.  It wants solutions.  It should examine that as a solution.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Government to recognise the enormous work carried out by carers and to proceed with the national carer's strategy as soon as possible.  The decision to abandon drafting that strategy is short-sighted and shameful.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I call Deputy Bannon.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to our economic welfare posed by the Taoiseach's admission that unemployment figures could exceed 450,000 before the end of the year and the lack of provision by the Government to get the workforce back into employment or training.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is hard enough to get Deputy Bannon to work.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 32.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Order of Business is No. 12, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal that section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 shall continue in force for the period ending on 8 March 2010 —  back from committee; No. 13, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for the transfer of command of the Irish contingent currently serving in Chad with EUFOR TCHAD-RCA to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT —  back from committee; No. 14, motion re appointment of chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission; and No. 1, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 [Seanad] —  Second Stage.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 12 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 13 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 35 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share their time, which shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes in each case; the proceedings on No. 14 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speeches of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes in each case.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12 without debate agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal regarding No. 14 agreed?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is not agreed.  I want to record the Labour Party's objection to the way in which this item is being taken.  The proposal concerns the appointment of a chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  The procedure for this appointment is that a nomination is made by the Government, approval is required by the Oireachtas and the appointment is made by the President.  There is a rationale to doing it that way.  The rationale is that the appointment of this office, and similar type offices, should have all-party agreement across the Oireachtas.The Government has not consulted the Labour Party about this appointment.  We are being presented with a decision of Government.  I want to be clear that I do not have any particular objection to the nominee being made by the Government but this is not the first time the Government has done that type of business in this way.  When the appointment was being made to the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Government decided to replace former Labour Minister, Liam Kavanagh, with former Fianna Fáil Minister, Michael Smith, without any prior consultation.  Similarly, when the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General was being made, even though the Labour Party had flagged in advance that we wanted to be consulted about the appointment, no consultation took place.  We now have this procedure again where no consultation has taken place.Day in and day out people inside the House and outside it tell us we should all get together and agree issues but when it comes to agreeing issues——
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	14	We hear the Deputy call for resignations the whole time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	15	——there must be a willingness on the part of the Government to consult about the matters that are required by law to be agreed by us across the House.  I am not objecting to the particular appointment today but I put down a marker that the next time the Government deals with an appointment like this one in this way, the Labour Party will oppose the appointment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I welcome the fact that the leader of the Labour Party has welcomed Mr. Gallagher's appointment as chairman of the commission.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	17	He did not say that.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	18	He has no particular objection and I take it there is unanimous confidence in the House for the proposed appointment, as a matter of practice, and that is welcome in the context of the important work the commission has to do.I understand from his statement that Deputy Gilmore has some constitutional objection to the manner in which the Government has proceeded.  The position is that the appointment of members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is dealt with in sections 65 and 66 of the Garda Síochána Acts 2005-07.  The President makes the appointment based on the nomination of the Government, subject to the passage of resolutions by the Dáil and Seanad recommending the appointment.The Government makes the nomination but it is subject to a resolution of the House.  There is no constitutional convention or legal obligation on the Government requiring it to consult with Opposition leaders.  It is a matter of prudence and wisdom for the Government of the day to decide whether to make that consultation.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Minister is travelling a very barren furrow.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	20	It is a divine right to rule territory.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	21	There is no question of that.  This is a matter of legislative practice.  There is no question of the Government claiming any prerogative other than following legislation.  I will draw Deputy Gilmore's comments to the attention of the Taoiseach and Government.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Is the proposal to deal with No. 14 agreed?  Agreed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20444	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I understand we will have a new Finance Bill and a new Social Welfare Bill.  I thank the Minister for the briefing we received on the state of the tax affairs and spending projections.  What are the ground rules for the debate we are entering into?  Will we see a new approach to Dáil evaluation, whereby the House would be presented with the options under consideration in each Department and the impact of the different options so there can be a mature debate in the House on the best way to tackle this problem?  Will we have the same situation we have seen in the past, where the Government produces a pre-cooked passage offered to the Dáil on a take it or leave it basis on one day, which will be 1 April?  What will happen?Will we have a genuine opportunity to engage with options so the House can look at different options and see what is best suited to this challenge or will we return to the old situation?  Let us be honest.  People have said the Opposition should participate and put forward its proposals.  There is no point in putting forward proposals if the Government will use them as sticks to beat the Opposition and not put its options on the table as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Hear, hear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20444	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	25	If there is to be engagement it must be from both sides.  The Government has all of the information on the options available, which was not released to us yesterday in any shape or form.  That information needs to be on the table so there can be a genuine exchange on what are the best options for the future.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	26	If they have any.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I take it this matter is being raised on the Order of Business in the context of any proposed announcement the Government may make in early April.  The Government is, of course, willing to supply Opposition parties with any information they wish to have if they want to inform themselves as to the options they believe are desirable.  I have already offered to have any options put forward by them costed in the Department to assist them in consideration——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Allow the Minister to respond.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Ultimately the Government, as I made clear yesterday, will make decisions in this area because it is obliged to and is responsible to the House for doing so.  Recommendations for decisions in this area must be made with the approval of Government.  The Government has told Opposition parties that if they wish to participate in this process they are welcome to do so.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20444	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I want clarification.  My question was very clear.  I asked if we would see a new process and if the Dáil would be engaged in looking at a set of options and reaching a mature decision as to what is best for the country or if the Government would come in on 1 April and say, "We have made our decision and the Opposition can like it or lump it".  That is the question.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	31	There is no need to ask about the procedure.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	32	They do not have a clue what they are doing.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	33	We will of course make whatever decisions are required in the national interest.  We welcome the assistance of the Opposition in putting forward any proposals it wishes to.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Does the Government have any?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Allow the Minister for Finance to continue.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	36	If it does not wish to put forward proposals and have them costed then clearly the Government will have to make a decision in any event.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Deputy Gilmore has been called.  Allow him to ask his question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	38	It will be like the appointment of the chairman of the Garda Ombudsman Commission.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Government is throwing shapes but there is no substance.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The Minister will attend the House and tell us again that it is the Government's constitutional responsibility to decide and we can take it or leave it.I want to raise some matters with the Minister.  There is a long-standing practice and procedure in the House whereby any Member can make a personal statement to the House about a matter which is in the public domain and about which they wish to make some statement of clarification.  Yesterday, following the conclusion of Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach made a statement which amounted to a personal statement on behalf of the Tánaiste and which purported to clarify certain remarks the Tánaiste made in the course of a radio interview and which were the subject of comment in the House.  I have a number of questions arising from that statement.Did the Taoiseach seek the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to make such a statement?  There is a requirement in the House that when a personal statement is made, permission is sought from the Ceann Comhairle and the form of the statement is agreed with him.  I want to know if that permission was sought.  Is it permissible for another Member of the House to make a personal statement on behalf of the Member concerned?  In this case, the Taoiseach was effectively making a personal statement on behalf of the Tánaiste and I want to know if that was in order.The Taoiseach has made a statement to the House on behalf of the Tánaiste and has put on the record of the House a version of the statement and responses made by the Tánaiste in the radio interview concerned which do not correspond to the transcript of the radio interview I read.  Will the Tánaiste attend the House and make a personal statement in connection with the interview?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	41	It is not appropriate to raise that matter on the Order of Business.  However, by way of general explanation, a personal explanation can only be made on the initiation of the individual concerned.  That is the normal procedure.  If somebody wishes to make a personal statement, they advise the Ceann Comhairle accordingly and time is allocated to do that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I have not finished.  The statement made by the Taoiseach yesterday does not correspond to the procedure outlined by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the House.  If the Tánaiste wants to make a statement clarifying what she said on the radio, which the House would welcome——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	43	It is not appropriate to raise the matter now.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	44	——she should make that personal statement herself and not have the Taoiseach make it on her behalf.A request has been made by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for additional powers to prosecute white collar and corporate crime.  It was reported in the Sunday newspapers that the director sought such additional powers to overcome the difficulty of what is called the "evidential burden" in company law cases.  We know this office is greatly engaged at present in investigating certain matters in the banks.  I understand the director has written to the Tánaiste——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Is legislation promised in this area?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	46	——seeking additional legislation to strengthen his powers.  The response from the Department, according to the report, is that it will be several months before it responds to the request.  Given the urgency of the matters the Director of Corporate Enforcement is investigating, I expected a more urgent response to this request than to say it will take a number of months to examine it.  Will Mr. Appleby's request for additional powers, particularly relating to issues to do with evidence, be addressed urgently by the Government?  Will appropriate legislation be brought forward?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Is legislation promised?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	48	No legislation is promised but, clearly, any request by Mr. Appleby will be entertained with expedition by the appropriate Minister and the Government.  It is important that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has the amplitude of powers it requires to restore the damaged reputation of the banking sector abroad.I am a little concerned at the contrast the Deputy drew between the approach the Government took to the appointment of the Garda Ombudsman, Mr. Gallagher who is a distinguished public servant and we did not believe his appointment was in any way exceptionable, and the approach we are taking to the grave position in our public finances where we will certainly put at the Deputy's disposal all the options involved and we will cost any proposals he may wish to bring forward in that regard.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Given that the HSE is spending millions of euro on public relations groups to promote its own propaganda, when will the health information Bill be delivered so that we can obtain truthful and proper information?In light of the severe economic circumstances faced by some people who are using unfortunate ways to address them, when will the mental health (amendment) Bill be introduced?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The mental health (amendment) Bill will be published later this year.With regard to the health information Bill, a wide ranging public consultation exercise, using a detailed discussion document prepared in the Department, was initiated in June 2008.  Many submissions were received, including several as late as October of that year.  The authors were then invited to participate in a major feature on the Bill at the annual health care society conference on 19 November last.  A structured and facilitated focus group took place on 20 January this year in Dublin.  This was a useful event and the Department will summarise the points raised at the focus group on its website shortly.  That level of consultation is essential, given the complex and sensitive nature of the Bill.  The Department is working towards finalising the heads of the legislation, which are expected in April.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	53	On legislation, a referendum commission was established by law to provide information to the public on the Lisbon treaty last summer and it produced its report recently, in which it complained strongly that it had only three weeks to conduct research and provide a draft of a leaflet for distribution to the citizenry.  It stated that it needed in the region of five months to do its business properly.  I am not sure whether the Minister can indicate the date the second referendum on the treaty will take place but, no matter when it is held, it is time to think about establishing the new referendum commission by law, as is required.  What plans has the Government in that respect?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	54	There is no proposal relating to a referendum commission.  No date has been fixed by the Government for the referendum but the establishment of the commission requires the publication of a Bill to amend the Constitution.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I ask this question in the context of the report by the outgoing commission in which it stated the new commission should be established by law at least five months in advance of a referendum so that it can conduct its business properly and disseminate information.  That was a major problem during the last referendum.

Will the Minister publish the document and lay it in the Oireachtas Library so that it would at least be available to Members?  The document is prepared and completed.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has promised us legislation on the control and regulation of local elections since the last general election.  He published the Bill yesterday but it is proposed to take it in the House next week using a guillotine on all Stages.  That will not give Opposition Members the normal 14 days between publication and the reading of Second Stage to peruse the legislation.  A guillotine has been proposed, which is unacceptable.

I refer to a number of Bills, including an amendment to section 4 of the Competition Act, the recognition of the right to organise and so on.  The listed number of labour law Bills is essential.  Taking my colleague, Deputy Costello's point, if the commission is eventually to prepare for a consultation on matters relating to the Lisbon treaty debate, the legislation should be in place.According to the social partners and confirmed by the Government at the beginning of their last meeting, this package of reform legislation and labour law was still in place.  Which Bill will be introduced first and when?  How much of the package will be completed during the current Dáil session?

I also referred to legislation on the recognition of the right to organise.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves:(i) the placing of the contingent of the Permanent Defence Force serving in Chad with the UN-authorised EU-led force, known as EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, under the authority of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1861 (2009) of 14 January, 2009;(ii) the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1861 (2009) of 14 January, 2009; and(iii) the continued deployment of personnel with EUFOR TCHAD/RCA during the handover period and pending the completion of the withdrawal of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.In commending the motion to the House, I wish to outline briefly its background and provide some brief information on the reason the Government decided to respond positively to the UN's request to Ireland to consider putting the Irish troops currently deployed in Chad under the command of the United Nations after 15 March 2009.Members will recall that the deployment of Defence Forces personnel with the current UN-mandated EU-led force in Chad was the subject of a lengthy debate in Dáil Éireann in November 2007.  The mandate for this EU-led mission will expire on 15 March 2009.  The Government has decided, on foot of a new UN Security Council resolution establishing a new "Blue Hat" force in Chad and the Central African Republic, to rehat our current contingent in Chad and to seek the approval of Dáil Éireann to this end.  The motion before the House was debated in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 18 February 2009.Pursuant to the Government decision on 10 February 2009, authorising arrangements for the transfer of command of the Irish contingent to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT, the motion has been placed on the Order Paper for Dáil Éireann.I will briefly outline the background to MINURCAT and the reason the Government decided to respond positively to the UN request for the "blue hatting" of the Defence Forces contingent currently serving in Chad.  The current EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic was established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 of 25 September 2007.  Following Government and Dáil approval, a contingent of some 400 Defence Forces personnel was deployed with this EU force in Chad.Following a formal request from the United Nations in October 2008, the Government approved, in principle, participation by the Defence Forces in the UN follow-on mission, MINURCAT, with a contingent similar in size and nature to its existing contribution to EUFOR.  On 14 January 2009, the Security Council unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1861 (2009), authorising the deployment of a military component of MINURCAT to follow on from the EUFOR mission at the end of its mandate.  The Security Council decided that MINURCAT shall include a maximum of 300 police officers, 25 military liaison officers, 5,200 military personnel, and an appropriate number of civilian personnel to carry out its tasks.On 10 February 2009, the Government formally approved the placing of the Irish contingent of the Permanent Defence Force currently serving with EUFOR in Chad under the authority of MINURCAT.  This approval was granted on the basis of the recently passed UN Security Council resolution, the ongoing commitment of a number of EU member states and confirmation that France plans to continue to provide the necessary logistics support to the UN Mission.The Defence Forces currently deploy a mechanised or wheeled infantry battalion in Goz Beida, south-eastern Chad, consisting of two mechanised manoeuvre companies, a battalion support group, as well as a battalion headquarters, a national support element and a national intelligence cell, which comprises approximately 400 personnel in total.  An additional 23 personnel serve in the force headquarters in Abeche and N'Djamena and 18 personnel in the operational headquarters in Paris.  Ireland is the second largest contributor to the mission.  The nature of the Irish battalion duties includes, inter alia, short and long-range patrolling, situational awareness and the provision of an overall security and deterrent presence within its area of operations.  To date, the Defence Forces have made a key contribution to the EU’s largest multinational deployment under European security and defence policy.  This was a major bridging operation and invaluable experience has been gained by the Defence Forces over the past 18 months from planning through execution to the imminent handover to the UN.  Major logistical and operational challenges were met in deploying to, and operating in, the heart of Africa.The current Chad deployment has validated the effectiveness of the planning processes and procurement procedures of the defence organisation, both civil and military.  Recently procured equipment such as armoured personnel carriers, APCs, weapons systems, field accommodation, etc. have been tested and have proven their value, acting as key enablers in contributing to the ongoing success of the Defence Forces' participation in this mission.  Through their performance in the EU-led mission, the Defence Forces have enhanced their reputation as a professional and impartial military force as they now prepare to re-hat under a Chapter VII UN mission with MINURCAT.If deployment to MINURCAT is approved, it is anticipated that the Defence Forces will deploy similar numbers of personnel between the camp in Goz Beida and the headquarters elements in Abeche and N'Djamena.  Certain personnel will continue to serve in EUFOR during the handover to MINURCAT and the completion of the withdrawal of EUFOR.  Thereafter, the EUFOR operational headquarters in Paris will be closed and the personnel withdrawn.  The Finnish Parliament approved, on 26 February 2009, the ongoing participation of Finnish troops in the UN crisis management operation in Chad and the Central African Republic and plans to deploy 80 troops.  The Finnish detachment will move from Abeche to the southern part of the Goz Beida operational area, to work together with the Irish battalion and replace the Netherlands armed scout platoon, which will withdraw from theatre on 15 March 2009.  The proposed commitment by the Defence Forces to MINURCAT will be for an initial period of one year.  Subject to the renewal of the mandate, a satisfactory review of the mission and available resources, the Minister for Defence would propose, subject to Government approval, to extend the Defence Forces participation on a year to year basis thereafter.  Contingent personnel will be rotated on a four-monthly basis similar to current EUFOR deployments.The expected contributors to the military component of MINURCAT will include Albania, Austria, Croatia, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway, Poland, Russia, Togo and Uruguay.  The UN has appointed an Irish officer, Brigadier General Gerald Aherne, as deputy force commander and he was deployed to theatre earlier this week.  Ireland also has secured the post of chief operations officer.The EUFOR TCHAD-RCA mission has progressed most satisfactorily.  Despite the challenges that have faced the mission, a solid foundation has been laid, which will help prepare the way to build future successes.  In recent updates, EUFOR's operation commander, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, has stated that the EUFOR mission is having a positive effect in creating a safe and secure environment for refugees, for displaced persons and for the wider population.  That said, the main threat to the local populations, which is being countered by the Defence Forces, arises from criminality, banditry and lawlessness.  There has been a noticeable decline in incidents of banditry in the Irish-led multinational battalion south's area of operations during January 2009 compared to December 2008.  A significant redeployment of Chadian forces in the general area has added to the security in the area, and assisted the reduction of banditry against the local population.  The three international and non-governmental organisations that withdrew from the area during October 2008, Medecins Sans Frontières, Action Against Hunger and the International Committee of the Red Cross, have returned their permanent presence to the area during the last week of January 2009.MINURCAT is expected to have a wider deployment than EUFOR in eastern Chad.  When the UN force is fully deployed and is able to provide the intended level of security, it is expected that the security situation at local level will improve, particularly from the criminality and banditry perspective.  The UN follow-on force will act under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that the force is authorised to take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operations in eastern Chad to fulfil its mandate.Ireland currently pays all its own costs arising from its participation in EUFOR TCHAD-RCA, together with a contribution to the common costs of the mission.  As the proposed follow-on force will be a UN-led operation, the UN will meet some of the costs of Ireland's participation in the mission.  It is estimated that UN reimbursement to the Exchequer will be in the region of approximately €8.5 million per annum, while the related cost to the Defence Vote amounts to approximately €16.2 million.  The expected reimbursement in 2009 will be €3.7 million.If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle bears with me, I have almost concluded.  To summarise, therefore, the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad clearly will continue to warrant an international presence beyond March 2009.  The commitment of troops currently deployed to EUFOR to the UN follow-on force is critical to avoid a security vacuum and ensure that civilians and UN personnel at risk continue to be protected.  MINURCAT is crucial to the overall effort to bring stability and hope to the region.  Having made a significant investment in providing safety, security and reassurance to the local population under the EU-led mission, and given Ireland's strong support for the UN, we have an obligation to ensure the success of the UN's efforts.  A positive response to the UN request would be consistent with Ireland's commitment to UN peacekeeping, particularly in Africa.Before I commend the motion to the House, I would like to express my appreciation, and that of the Government, for the work of Lieutenant General Pat Nash as operation commander.  Together with his staff, he has been unstinting in his efforts to ensure the success of the mission since his appointment.  The post of operation commander is a highly prestigious position within the overall mission and this was the first time that Ireland or any other smaller member state within the European Union has been offered such a senior role within an EU-led peace support operation.  It is a recognition of the standing of the Defends Forces in the field of peace support operations generally.  Lieutenant General Nash's role is to manage the overall military operation and to provide the military interface between the operation, MINURCAT, the EU and the UN.  All Members will agree that he has undertaken this role with distinction since his appointment in October 2007.  I wish Lieutenant General Nash every success in his retirement in the coming months and I commend the motion to the House.

As the Minister of State noted, it is important that the force is being led by an Irish man who is internationally renowned for his military competence and capacity.  It is important for Members to reflect on what the Irish troops are doing in Chad and what sort of place that country is.  Like the Minister of State, I do not usually speak on defence matters but my research on Chad indicates it is a particularly inhospitable place.  It has an estimated population of almost 11 million people and has a life expectancy for males and females of 46 and 48, respectively.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I visited Uganda some years ago and in many ways its profile is similar to that of Chad.  It is a very poor country with many serious problems, medical and otherwise.  Some 5% of the population is HIV positive, equating to approximately 200,000 people.  More than 250,000 people from neighbouring countries have sought refuge in Chad.  Its difficult geographical terrain has led to it being described as the "dead heart of Africa".  With a largely desert climate, it is an inhospitable place in which to live and an extremely difficult environment in which to pursue agricultural activities.  In addition, there are the serious political problems in Chad and the countries surrounding it.  That is why our troops are there.The purpose of this motion is to effect the transfer of command of the mission to the United Nations.  This motion offers an opportunity for us to reflect on the importance of our Army and on the great contribution it makes as a peacekeeping force.  In this regard, it offers a contrast to other armies we see on the news every day, many of which are carrying out appalling atrocities in countries where they should never have been in the first place.  The people of Chad need the contribution of our Army.  Its activity there takes place under the imprimatur of the United Nations.  This is a humanitarian mission and it is necessary and worthy.However, it is also highly risky —  the most dangerous mission ever undertaken by the Army.  Full protection must be seen to be in place and remain in place for the duration of the mission.  That is the task and duty of this House and the United Nations.  If proper protection, facilities and back-up are in place, the risks to our troops will not be entirely removed but will certainly be minimised.   ensure every step is taken and that no corners are cut in ensuring all the necessary facilities and back-up are in place.  However, if the situation deteriorates, the force could find itself in a very dangerous environment, caught between warring rebels, a Government against which human rights accusations have been levelled and a mass of refugees from Darfur.  It is an exceptionally risky mission.  This House and this nation are extremely proud of the exceptional Irish men who undertake this dangerous mission.I draw the Minister of State's attention to an article in The Irish Times today by Captain James Cahill from Barna, County Galway.  It is a wonderful piece of writing which brings home in a personal way what is going on in Chad and the knowledge, back-up, preparation and commitment involved.  The Defence Forces and the Department of Defence should encourage participation by way of website, letters and so on.  We should get behind these personnel as much as possible.Many people think of Chad as a faraway, unhappy land in which battles take place over issues of which we know nothing in towns whose names we cannot even pronounce.  Captain Cahill's article makes clear for us the reality of peacekeeping in a troubled regions.  He stated:I'm leading my troops into the African desert with rebels and bandits known to operate in the area.  It's a strange feeling, a mixture of adrenaline, fear, excitement and self-doubt.  Have I done everything I can to get my troops ready for this?  Will they follow me?  This is it, this is Chad.This descriptive passage communicates how the leaders of our soldiers feel about this mission, their commitment to their job and the commitment of the Department and Government to our endeavours in this troubled place.  Captain Cahill speaks of the soldiers' preparations for their deployment in Chad:Given that the political, cultural, medical, operational and environmental conditions are so different to home, we had endless briefings covering cultural awareness, the political situation in Chad, our mission and most importantly for soldiers our rules of engagement, when, how and if we can open fire in a hostile situation.He goes on to describe the reactions of local people to the Irish troops:On our hand-over patrols we visited a lot of villages and refugee camps in our area of operation.  One of the first things that became apparent to me was that nobody is lying at the side of the road starving to death as is the case in other parts of the continent.  Instead you are met with unsure glances which quickly turn to waves and smiles when they recognise friendly faces.  This to me highlighted the unease in the country at the moment and was a real eye-opener.We must support our soldiers in their activities.  In these difficult days for our country, it is great to see men of such calibre putting their lives on the line to bring peace to a war-town area which may be heading into even greater uncertainty.  This is surely an inspiration for young people.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that everything possible is being done to ensure there is continuing support for the troops?  That is one of the key points on which I have been asked to seek assurance.  I have also been asked to raise the issue of the arrest warrant issued against the President of Sudan for crimes against humanity.  What are the immediate issues to consider in terms of the impact on the Chad-Sudan-Central African Republic region?How do we ensure our troops are safe in this environment?  In particular, they must be able to react instantly if refugees begin fleeing from Sudan.  We must have assurances that the hand-over process will not weaken the position of our soldiers and place them at risk.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will provide those assurances.  Our troops in Chad must have full support and back-up.  No risks must be taken in this regard.  Their mission is crucial to the stability of the region and to the safety of the refugees from Darfur.Ireland has made an enormous commitment to foreign aid.  In particular, Irish Aid is doing a wonderful job in Africa.  Members who have gone there were extremely impressed by the professionalism, commitment and dedication of those involved.  It is a completely different world, peopled by practical idealists who get the job done while believing in service and something beyond themselves.  The mission in Chad reflects all these good qualities in the Army.  I welcome and fully support the motion while asking the Minister of State to provide the assurances I have sought.

Ar ndóigh, tá dea-scéalta ag teastáil go géar sna laethanta atá againn faoi láthair.  In these gloomy and uncertain times of unprecedented economic recession, it is uplifting to debate a positive motion such as this.  The EUFOR TCHAD-RCA mission, which is now coming to a close, has been under the overall command of Lieutenant General Pat Nash, who has done a great job.  I add my congratulations to those offered by the Minister of State and Deputy O'Dowd.The operation encompasses Chad and the Central African Republic.  The region has improved in terms of safety and security for refugees, displaced persons and the population in general.  Deputy O'Dowd referred to the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court against the Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, with regard to criminal activities of great concern to the court.  The Chinese authorities have sought the suspension of the case against the Sudanese President.  The licences of between six and ten NGOs operating in Darfur have been revoked and this is a serious matter.  One of the NGOs affected is Oxfam, which works with 600,000 people in north Sudan, of whom 400,000 are in Darfur.  The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has noted that this is a serious setback to the lifesaving operations in Darfur and has urged the Government of Sudan to restore the NGOs to operational status.  We all echo his call.The concern we have is the effect this may have on further refugees coming from Darfur and the consequences for the area in terms of the operation of Irish troops.  I visited Abeche and N'Djamena in Chad but I did not get as far as Goz Beida.  To see our troops perform a task at least as well as anywhere else in the world is uplifting.  Terrain is hostile, hot and barren.  Uncertainty exists because of bandits and militia groups.  Have there been recent security reports on the possible consequences of developments in Sudan with regard to the action taken by the International Criminal Court?  I visited one of the refugee camps and got the feeling that while the Irish troops have improved the situation a great deal many of the refugees would not have a great inclination to return home for a long time.  Even though they are not very good, the conditions under the EUFOR mission, which will continue under the blue hatted mission, are better than conditions in Sudan.When this motion was being considered by the committee, I asked the Minister how long he would expect the Irish commitment to continue beyond this year.  The indication was that it would be about a maximum of another year when the year under the UN mandate has expired.  We are doing a very good job there and I raise this concern and seek an update on security because of the possibility of short-term developments putting our Irish troops at greater risk.  I would like the matter clarified.This was the biggest mission by the EUFOR under the operational command of Lieutenant-General Nash and it was a success.  There were major problems to begin with, such as the logistics of setting up camp in an area 2,000 miles from the sea, and this was a major undertaking.  It was discharged very well.  The UN base was under construction when I visited the area and I am sure progress has been made on this.  The fact that Lieutenant-General Nash oversaw this mission from its inception through to its conclusion and the fact that it has been successful makes me very proud as an Irish person and a Member of this House.I understand that hospital care is provided by Italians in Chad.  Will this continue?  Will there be a change in the medical personnel we will deal with?  The rainy season will begin in three months' time and this has the effect of slowing everything down.  The Labour Party gives full support to this motion.

Is oth liom nach bhfuil an tAire anseo.  Níor thuig mé go raibh a phost chomh gnóthach sin.  Ar aon chaoi, tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl sa Dáil, mar go bhfuil muid ag glacadh cinnidh 400 saighdiúr a chur chuig réigiún dáinséarach ina bhfuil cogadh ar siúl in aice leis, Chad.  I welcome the fact that Ireland is once again reverting to the UN mandate, the blue-hatted missions, as indicated by the deployment of over 400 soldiers.  This is where we should have been; EU military missions are contrary to our supposed military neutrality.  Our experimentation with EU battle groups should be brought to an end, with our defence forces committed only to UN blue-hatted peacekeeping missions.  This would be an endorsement of the primacy of the UN model and would allow the UN to operate effectively if we could encourage other countries to do likewise.In this time of recession it makes economic sense for Ireland to revert to such missions.  The mission in Chad has cost us over €60 million to date, none of which is recoupable, as it would be if it was a UN-led mission.  Over 50% of costs of the new mission will be recoupable.  It is a sign of the esteem in which Ireland is held when operating in UN-led missions that, of the 14 countries committing to this mission, Brigadier-General Gerald Aherne has been appointed deputy force commander and an Irish officer will take up the position of chief operations officer.  I wish the new mission well and hope this is a sign the Minister is recommitting to UN led missions only.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I thank the House for its recognition of the importance of Ireland's and the Defence Forces' contribution to international peace and security.  I am particularly grateful for the kind words and compliments from Deputies regarding the manner in which the Defence Forces have discharged themselves in these missions.  The debate reflects the high regard in which the Defence Forces are held internationally as peacekeepers and the warm regard with which the Irish people hold our Defence Forces, recognising the important role they play in the communities served both here and abroad.I assure the House that the decision to go to Chad and remain on there was not taken lightly.  In considering any mission, our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount importance.  However, all missions involve some element of risk.I will try to address, as best and as briefly as I can, the questions which were raised.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy O'Dowd's comments on the diary which Lieutenant Cahill has been writing in The Irish Times, and is worth circulating.  I recommend to the Department that it find ways to ensure we engage through websites, blogs etc. with our troops.  That is probably already happening.The humanitarian position in Chad is very difficult.  The world development indicators place Chad at 170 from 179 countries and the humanitarian situation in the country has continued to deteriorate.  As a result of EUFOR creating a safe and secure environment, the number of refugees, and particularly the number of internally displaced persons in the country, has increased and the ability of host communities to cope has decreased.  Deputy O'Shea has seen this at first hand.  There are 290,000 refugees and 180,000 internally displaced persons in eastern Chad.Since the beginning of 2007, Ireland has provided more than €11 million in funding for humanitarian relief projects in Chad and these projects are undertaken by UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF, UNHCR and NGOs, including Concern.  I was asked if the Minister is satisfied that the safety of troops is being protected.  The Minister has been assured that Irish troops have all the necessary supports to do their job and protection of the force is always paramount.  The Defence Forces have displayed a full range of force protection assets, and these will also be deployed in the MINURCAT mission.  I understand the forces have become very competent in the areas of protection and have the appropriate equipment.The duration of the deployment is a maximum of three years, with a report going to Government at the end of this year.  The extension of the mission is contingent on the renewal of the mandate.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	109	That will have to be decided by Government.On the issue of medical facilities to be provided, as well as a level two hospital in Abeche, there will be a level one facility with each battalion with a capacity to support a minimum of two locations.  There will also be a level one-plus medical facility with the company group in Boro and access to a level two facility in N'Djamena.  Norway will replace Italy in providing medical care when the mission re-hats on 15 March.There were a number of questions regarding the International Criminal Court as pertaining to the events in Darfur.  Ireland fully supports the International Criminal Court's fundamental role in the promotion of international justice and the fight against impunity.  Those responsible for the abuse of human rights in Darfur must face the consequences of their actions, as this is necessary both for the sake of common justice and to deter further acts of this kind.We were all shocked to hear that the Sudanese authorities have decided to expel approximately ten NGOs engaged in essential humanitarian work in Darfur, and this is yet another signal of the Sudanese Government's appalling disregard for human life in Darfur.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is in contact with Irish NGOs which work in Sudan and is monitoring the position closely.  So far the programmes of the Irish NGOs have not been directly affected but the working environment is clearly becoming more difficult.I understand that some of the NGOs expelled from Sudan are in receipt of Irish Aid funding and the Department of Foreign Affairs will follow up with the organisations concerned.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has issued a statement of his position in that regard.I commend the individual members of the Permanent Defence Force who have served and continue to serve on overseas missions, as I commend their families and loved ones.  Ireland's substantial contribution to the international peace effort depends on the ongoing commitment of Defence Forces personnel to serve overseas in difficult and dangerous circumstances.  Their commitment, service and loyalty to the tradition of the Defence Forces and overseas services contributes extensively to the high regard in which Ireland is held within the international communities.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I move:That Dáil Éireann, noting that the Government on 3 February 2009 nominated Mr. Dermot Gallagher for appointment by the President to be a member of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and to be its Chairperson, recommends, pursuant to section 65(1)(b) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, that he be appointed by the President to be a member and to be Chairperson of the Commission.The Government at its meeting of 3 February decided to nominate Mr. Dermot Gallagher for appointment by the President as chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  A vacancy in the position of the chairperson arose following the untimely death of Judge Kevin Haugh.On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I place on the record my appreciation of the work done by Judge Haugh as the first chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  He devoted his considerable talents and much energy to its establishment and was assiduous in his concern that the commission should operate to the highest standards.  In addition to his formidable intellect, he was possessed of a warm personality and great good humour that won him many friends at the Bar and beyond.  I would also like to express, once again, my condolences to his family and many friends on their loss.The motion which comes before this House today arises from the operation of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  This is a piece of legislation which has thoroughly reformed the institutional landscape of policing in Ireland.  As Deputies will be aware, the Garda Commissioner has been given greater autonomy in the management of the Garda Síochána.Along with greater autonomy the Act has provided for greater accountability.  For example, as Accounting Officer, the Garda Commissioner is directly answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and has come before that committee on many occasions since the passing of the legislation.  He has also taken over responsibility for the employment of the civilian staff of the Garda Síochána from my Department.  The Act also provided for the Garda Inspectorate, which acts as a driver of efficiency and effectiveness for the Garda Síochána as it benchmarks the performance of the force against comparable police services and international best practice.One of the most significant and most important changes instituted by the 2005 Act was the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which replaced its forerunner, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  I put on record my thanks to the members of the board over the years, and all the staff who served there, for the commendable work they did.  The replacement of the board is in no way a reflection of the quality of its efforts and it is rather a recognition of the weaknesses in the legislation under which it operated.As the body charged with handling complaints against members of the Garda Síochána the ombudsman commission is empowered to independently investigate complaints against Garda members.  It has also been conferred by the Act with policing powers of arrest and detention.  The commission's role and values are summed up in the words contained in its official logo —  inquiry, independence, impartiality.The ombudsman commission has been in operation since May 2007 and has received just over 5,000 complaints to date, 3,539 of which have been finalised.  I know that there is a lot of interest in the work of the ombudsman commission and, in particular, in certain cases it has dealt with, as well as other cases it is currently pursuing.  As the commission is a fully independent body, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific facts or other elements of any particular case handled by the commission.With regard to staffing matters, there are 98 sanctioned posts in the ombudsman commission, not including the three commissioners, along with four seconded Garda superintendents.  The ombudsman commission has invested heavily in the training and development of its staff.  In that area it has worked extensively with the University of Portsmouth and the King's Inns in developing state-of-the-art training for its investigative staff, in particular.The ombudsman commission's budget allocation for 2009 is more than €11 million.  This represents a significant investment on the part of the State in the commission and it also reflects the importance of the functions that are involved.Arising from the experience of its initial period of operation, the ombudsman commission has brought forward a number of proposals for amendments to the provisions of the 2005 Act governing the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.  The proposals made by the ombudsman commission are still under discussion with the commission and with the Garda Síochána.  The issues concerned involve considerable complexity not only from a legislative standpoint but also from an operational one.  They require careful consideration by all parties concerned.  However, work has been done towards preparing the necessary statutory amendments.  I hope that any outstanding issues will be resolved quickly and that I will shortly be in a position to bring proposed legislative changes to Government.The appointment of members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is dealt with by sections 65 and 66 of the 2005 Act.  There is a specific formality about the appointment provisions which marks the importance of the commission and its independence.  In that context it should be noted that the Act requires the President to make the appointments.  Aside from members of the Government and the Judiciary, a very limited number of public appointments are made by the President.While a person is nominated for appointment as a member of the commission by the Government, it is a requirement that any such appointment must be approved by the Oireachtas in the form of the passage of resolutions by the Dáil and the Seanad recommending the appointment.  This is the purpose of the resolution which is before the House today.The first members of the commission, the late Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh, Ms. Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady, were appointed for a six year term with effect from 12 December 2005.  There was unanimous support in both Houses for these appointments.  I sincerely hope that this will also be the case in respect of Mr. Gallagher.The tasks of the chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission are wide-ranging and demanding.  They include overseeing the investigation of complaints of misbehaviour on the part of members of the Garda Síochána; the exercise of policing powers by the commission; management of a large caseload; and supervision of the operation of the relevant provisions of the Garda Síochána Act.  These, and the other challenges of the office, require a chairperson of excellent judgment and decision-making, proven management skills and the ability to lead a team of fellow commissioners, investigators and administrative staff.In Mr. Dermot Gallagher the Government has nominated a public servant who has served this country with great distinction for many years as a senior diplomat and in other fields of public administration.  In that regard the Government is fully satisfied that Mr. Gallagher has the necessary capacity and qualifications to make an excellent chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  Members of the House will be aware Mr. Gallagher recently retired as Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He previously served as Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach.  At Secretary General level, which is the very highest post in the Civil Service, he managed the work of two Departments at the heart of Government with broad and complex remits.  Mr. Gallagher is one of Ireland's most distinguished public servants.  In particular, he played a central role in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I saw at first hand the diligence, acumen, judgment and leadership skills that I have no doubt he will be in a position to bring to bear as chairman of the ombudsman commission.Section 66(6) of the Garda Act provides that a person appointed to fill a vacancy following the death of a member of the ombudsman commission shall hold office for the remainder of the term of office of the replaced member.  Therefore, the new appointee will only serve until 2011.Given the importance of the post and the limited duration of the appointment, the Government decided that the position should be filled without delay.  It should also be noted that the nomination process adopted in the case of Mr. Gallagher is very much the same as that which was followed when the first members of the commission were nominated by the Government in 2005.In addition, I would like to mention another aspect of the terms of the appointment.  Unfortunately, there has been some speculation in regard to the remuneration for this appointment.  In that regard, I want the House to note that Mr. Gallagher has offered to take on the position at an annual salary of €90,000.  This will result in a saving of €153,000 per annum.The role of any police force is extremely challenging.  At its core is the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order.  This role frequently brings gardaí into contact with members of the public in what are often difficult circumstances.  To carry out their tasks gardaí are given extensive powers, including powers of arrest and detention.  These powers, although used in challenging and often dangerous circumstances, must be exercised in a lawful and proportional manner.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has been established to investigate complaints of misbehaviour by members of the public on the part of gardaí.  It too has a very demanding role.The highly skilled and dedicated staff of the commission require a chairperson equal to the challenges of the brief.  The Government considered carefully the question of whom to nominate to the post of chairperson.  In Mr. Dermot Gallagher we are satisfied that we have found a public servant with an outstanding record of achievement who clearly has with the intellectual capacity, expertise and personal dedication to lead the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  I am therefore very happy to recommend the adoption of this resolution to the House.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I join the Minister in extending my condolences and those of the Fine Gael Party to the family of the late Mr. Justice Haugh, the former chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, his passing in January being the reason we are approving this appointment this afternoon.  Mr. Justice Haugh had a distinguished career, the final phase of which involved his chairmanship of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  He made an excellent contribution to the establishment of the commission in its early stages.  I also take this opportunity to commend his work ethic and his commitment to the post.  He leaves a fine legacy behind in the many areas of justice in which he participated during the course of his lifetime.The late Mr. Justice Haugh is to be replaced by Mr. Dermot Gallagher, a man with an outstanding record as a diplomat and a public servant in his country.  He served with distinction in San Francisco, at the UN in New York, in London, Nigeria and Brussels.  His pivotal role in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement has being well documented.  We are fortunate that he remains willing to serve and I congratulate the Minister on the appointment.However, the appointment of Mr. Dermot Gallagher represents both a triumph and a failure for the Government.  Securing the appointment of a person of Mr. Gallagher's status and stature is a most positive achievement.  However, the process in which this appointment is taking place is unsatisfactory.  The Minister has been a Minister in government for the past 11 years or more and during that time he has seen his party, Fianna Fáil, earn a well deserved reputation for cronyism.  Friends of the party were appointed to all manner of State boards, prison visiting committees and film classification panels with no regard for their qualifications or aptitude in the relevant area.  Ministers behaved like provincial dictators dispensing patronage on a regular and continuing basis.  The only thing that mattered was the colour green of the Fianna Fáil Party membership card.We are still left in the league of perhaps some tin-pot South American dictatorships or some of the less democratic African regimes.  However, the majority of modern democracies have moved from such medieval practices.  Regrettably, cronyism is alive and well in Ireland under Fianna Fáil.   We only need consider the recent banking and financial scandal to see the labyrinth and network of cronies with fingers in the pies of banks and property development all leading back to the tent at the Galway Races.  It is time that changed.It is important that we bring this country into line with best practice and accountability.  My party, Fine Gael, recently suggested that the Dáil be something more than a rubber-stamp, if an appointment comes before the House at all, which generally it does not.  The only reason it does in this case is that the Ombudsman Act 2005, as the Minister rightly said, requires a positive resolution of the House to approve or ratify this appointment.  We should do things differently.The Fine Gael proposal is that the practice of placing persons on State boards, whose sole qualification is political allegiance, will end.  The suitability of appointments must be vetted by the appropriate Oireachtas committee.Fine Gael recently published the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2008, the purpose of which is to provide a measure of accountability and Oireachtas oversight into the appointment of persons to the boards of statutory agencies and public bodies.  The Bill makes provision for the placing before Dáil Éireann of the names and qualifications of ministerial nominees to statutory agencies and public bodies.  One can exercise a degree of oversight in respect of not only the names and qualifications, but also the aptitude and suitability of the person.  The Bill provides for the appearance before the relevant Oireachtas committee of proposed nominees for appointment to the position of chief executive and board chairperson of statutory agencies and public bodies.  It provides for confirmation by way of resolution of Dáil Éireann of nominees to the position of chief executive and board chairperson of statutory agencies.  It provides that the names of other board members of statutory agencies and nominations to other public bodies shall be laid before the appropriate Oireachtas committee 21 days prior to their nomination taking effect.  In doing so the Bill provides a safeguard to ensure that only the most qualified and suitable available candidates are appointed to the position of board chairman and chief executive resulting in greater confidence in the management of statutory agencies.In introducing the Bill, we are seeking to bring a higher level of standard to high places.  The Bill would play a key role in introducing transparency to the appointments process.  It would go some way towards restoring people's faith in politics and I appeal to Ministers to be more open-minded about the Bill than they have been about other worthy Private Members' Bills in the past.By appointing Mr. Dermot Gallagher and then asking this House to rubberstamp the decision, Fianna Fáil has lumped in a distinguished civil servant with the rest of its cronies.  It has prompted civil rights agencies to question the absence of an open and transparent recruitment process, which is a shame.  Mr. Gallagher should have been given the opportunity to come before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about his suitability for this post, a task that all Government appointees to State agencies and boards should be subject to.  Failing to introduce a transparent and accountable appointment procedure by allowing the Oireachtas a real say in appointments does little for the reputation of the Government, casts an unfair shadow over appointees of the stature of Mr. Gallagher, angers the public and leads to Ireland scoring very poorly in corruption indices carries out by international bodies such as Transparency International.  Only this week we have seen a report from that body.It is high time that we brought our practices up to date and into line with other democracies.  It is regrettable from Mr. Gallagher's perspective that he did not have the opportunity to subject himself to questions and scrutiny on appropriateness because I believe he would have done really well.  I do not believe anybody in this House could have anything but the highest regard for one of the State's most outstanding public servants.Since its establishment in May 2007 the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has been very busy.  It has received more than 3,000 complaints from the public and in excess of 300 referrals from Garda headquarters.  Some 34 files have been sent to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.As a constituency Deputy, I am sometimes approached by members of the public who feel they have a case involving their dealings with the Garda that merits and requires investigation.  Having an organisation with a statutory remit to investigate such claims makes perfect sense, both from the point of view of the complainant and the individual being complained about.  On its introduction we welcomed the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 that gave rise to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  I am very concerned about proposals to limit the remit of the commission to major cases only.  I heard the Minister make reference to this again this morning.  On the one hand, I can see why the commission would believe that its time would be better spent on the big issues.  On the other hand, issues that may be minor for the commission can be a major cause of concern for the complainant.  It is essential that justice is not only done but is seen to be done and, accordingly, I would urge both the commission and the Minister to ensure that the commission continues to operate a broad remit.  If a lack of resources is an issue, the Minister should examine that issue.It is two years since the body was established.  I would like the Minister to brief the House on how he considers the commission is operating, if it is being held back in any way whether by reason of legislation or resources, and what can be done to help the commission to carry out its functions in the most effective and efficient way possible.  How often, for example, is the Minister briefed on the work of the commission?It is essential that complaints, particularly those of a very serious nature, are investigated in a thorough manner.  Nothing less will do in the context of restoring public faith in the Garda Síochána in the light of recent damaging developments such as those confirmed by the findings of the Morris tribunal, the likes of which must never be allowed to happen again.  It is essential that lessons be learned from Donegal and that all the recommendations of the Morris tribunal be carried through to the letter.In spite of good progress on the findings of the Morris tribunal and corresponding legislative and structural change to the operation and management of the Garda Síochána, concerns still remain.  In particular, recent reports have alleged that there are issues of mismanagement, bullying, unacceptable behaviour and unlawful practices at Garda stations in County Cavan.  I would hope these are subjected to appropriate scrutiny and dealt with in a thorough manner.  There is also concern at the recent Galway taxi case which again goes to the heart of the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the citizens.Efficiency is key in that allegations must be investigated and dealt with appropriately as soon as possibly to restore the faith of the citizen in the structures of the State and in particular the Garda Síochána.  Nothing less is required for the honour and reputation of the Garda, the vast majority of whose members have served with dignity and distinction since the foundation of the State.  Nothing less is required for the citizens of the country and for democracy to flourish and prosper here.I am particularly concerned at the recent case involving the alleged drug dealer and Garda informant, Mr. Kieran Boylan, which should be vigorously and efficiently investigated and, if appropriate, matters should be referred to the appropriate authorities.  I understand that the commission is engaged in a public interest inquiry in this matter, but there needs to be a timeframe and the report needs to be advanced urgently.It is not lightly that I mention the name of any citizen in this House.  It has been alleged that Mr. Boylan, a drug trafficker, had a relationship with the Garda that facilitated collusion and resulted in Boylan being shielded from drugs charges by a small group of gardaí in this city.  It is alleged that while working with the Garda, Mr. Boylan was trafficking drugs into this jurisdiction with the knowledge of certain members of the Garda who appear to have turned a blind eye and did all in their power to keep him out of prison.  Questions must be answered in respect of why charges against Mr. Boylan for importing heroin and cocaine worth an estimated €1.7 million, seized at a truckers' yard in Ardee, County Louth in the Minister's constituency in October 2005, were dropped and a nolle prosequi entered.  It is alleged the reason is that Mr. Boylan threatened to reveal details of his relationship with members of the force, which would cause embarrassment.  Moreover, it has been reported that when people discovered drugs on Mr. Boylan’s premises in 2004 and reported the matter to the Garda in confidence, they were subsequently threatened by Mr. Boylan and his associates, and the Garda appears to have failed to act on the information in an appropriate or any manner at all.The breach of trust that would result in a confidential report to the Garda by members of the public being ignored and then the person complained about being told about it and threatening those who were carrying out their civic duties is a gross breach of trust and must be investigated.  Internal Garda inquiries are no longer satisfactory in matters as serious as that involving Mr. Kieran Boylan.  It is essential that the commission carries out this investigation with great care and efficiency but within a specific and definite timeframe.  Nothing less is required at this delicate moment in the history of the Garda Síochána.I acknowledge the Office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  I salute those involved for their work to date.  I urge the commission to retain its broad remit, to speak out if resources are holding it back and to play its part in maintaining public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  I congratulate Mr. Dermot Gallagher on his appointment and wish him and his colleagues well in their important task ahead.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I am glad to see Mr. Dermot Gallagher appointed to this important job.  As the Minister said, he is a distinguished civil servant.  I can say that while agreeing with everything Deputy Flanagan has said about the manner in which we make these appointments.  It is unforgivable that the Minister did not even bother to observe the courtesies of consulting the Opposition before presenting this to the House and presenting Mr. Gallagher for appointment to the President.That is the way the Minister does business and the way the Government does business, except when it is in a hole in the economy of its own making so deep we are talking about international rescue and it wants the co-operation of the Opposition.  It does not want the co-operation of the Opposition, however, when it comes to making important public appointments like this.  I do not want to retrace everything Deputy Flanagan has said but it is time we changed the system in this regard if we intend to maintain public confidence.I say that while welcoming Mr. Gallagher to this important job.  I am aware of the service he has done the State up to now and it is typical of the man that he would take a much lower level of remuneration for this job, an aspect of the appointment that has attracted a lot of attention outside the House.  I do not want to say more about it, except that I am glad he is in the job.I agree with the Minister in the remarks he made about the late Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh and the courtesy and imagination he applied to the job before his premature death.  It is a hugely important job.  All one has to do is read the Morris tribunal reports in respect of what went on in Donegal to know that.  However, I am more concerned about the more minor transgressions and allegations of more minor misbehaviour that one gets from time to time.We know, notwithstanding the eminent and dedicated people who served on the Garda Complaints Board, that it did not work and that gardaí investigating gardaí does not work and does not any longer have public confidence.  This is despite the fact the population generally has always been, quite properly, supportive of the Garda Síochána and recognises the role it has played in our society since the foundation of the State.  It is in the best interests of gardaí themselves that law-abiding citizens would feel that where allegations of misbehaviour are made against individual members of the Garda, they are independently and without fear or favour investigated.  While they could not say that up to now, we now have the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.There was a good deal of argument in the House about the nature and so on of the commission, particularly with regard to whether it ought to be a single commissioner rather than a triumvirate and a whole lot of issues that, for good or ill, have been decided.  Now, we need to be able to examine the efficacy of the functioning of this body that threw open its doors in May 2007.Notwithstanding that, no reports have yet been put up on the website and there is only a single report relating to the fatal accident in which a young man, Derek O'Toole, was killed in Lucan by a car driven by an off-duty garda.  The only report on the website states that the commission is not investigating that matter for reasons the late Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh set out in a number of items of correspondence with me.I do not want to draw any conclusions or for any conclusions to be inferred from what I am saying about the tragic circumstances in which young Derek O'Toole lost his life.  I am very concerned about the fact a newspaper immediately put abroad the word that he was known to the gardaí.  He was not known to the gardaí and while this was subsequently established, it was leaked by a garda.  This was the aspect examined by the commission and it did indeed believe it had identified the garda.  However, the manner in which the PULSE system is operated did not enable it to say it was this particular garda because he could say others were logging on to the same system and it may not be him.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.  I am somewhat concerned that at this stage we do not have reports on which we can yet measure the performance of this very important body.I agree with what Deputy Flanagan has said about the exclusion of minor cases, which would be entirely wrong.  I do not know what the Minister said about this matter as I cannot find it in his script —  I must apologise for not being in the House when he spoke, as I was at another meeting.  The exclusion of minor cases would be wrong, and while there is minor and minor, I would be worried about this for the reasons already outlined.The most controversial case on the desk of the new chairperson of the tribunal is the case of international drugs trafficker Kieran Boylan, his relations with members of the Garda Síochána and the related question of why a nolle prosequi was entered by the DPP in the matter of Boylan having been caught in possession of €1.7 million worth of cocaine and heroin.  Boylan had already been convicted and imprisoned in the UK and in Ireland, albeit for a surprisingly short sentence, for serious drug offences.  He is a major importer of drugs into this country.  While on bail, he was caught red-handed in Ardee, in the Minister’s constituency, with cocaine and heroin valued at €1.7 million.  Incredibly, the charges related to this seizure were struck out and only re-entered after members of this House raised the issue.  However, that was not the only amazing development.  On 31 July 2008, on the last day of the courts session before the summer recess, although not listed for mention and without notice, a nolle prosequi was entered on behalf of the DPP.  Questioned by the judge, the senior counsel for the DPP stated only that “it is a matter for very, very careful consideration at a high level”.Drugs have ravaged some of our communities, destroyed the lives of young people, caused the murder of innocent civilians and, of course, provoked a spate of gangland killings that are still under way.  How could the prospects of putting behind bars such a serious drugs dealer, importer and criminal be undermined by a decision at a very "high level"?  The only reasonable inference is that Boylan was saved from prison by the intervention of corrupt gardaí or that he was protected because he is a Garda informant.Mr. Justice Morris dealt with this issue of informants after the Donegal nightmare.  The key requirement of the new informant system that he recommended would have required that all informants would be registered compulsorily and that a full assessment of the suitability of the informant would be undertaken by crime and security branch; there would be provision for oversight and periodic independent audits of the operation of the informant handling procedure; and so on.  That could not have happened in this case and it raises questions about whether such a critical recommendation of Morris has actually been implemented.Since the DPP has announced that in certain circumstances he may be willing to provide public information in certain cases where he declined to prosecute, there appear to be compelling reasons why he should explain his decision in the Boylan case.  As I understood the "Prime Time" programme, the inference is that Boylan is not a registered informant but has a relationship with individual gardaí and because of this the criminal prosecution system moved to protect him.  I do not rule out the possibility of an explanation but most law-abiding citizens will have great difficulty envisaging what greater good could possibly justify the surreptitious entry of a nolle prosequi in the circumstances described.The findings of the Garda Ombudsman Commission in this case will be a benchmark against which that body will be judged by law-abiding citizens for the future.  If there is an explanation why a man importing poison and death should be exempt from the criminal justice system we should be told what it is.

It is seldom one has an allegation as serious as the importation of €1.7 million worth of drugs.  Most of the allegations that come to our clinics in respect of misbehaviour among individual members of the Garda Síochána concern far more minor matters.  It is in the best interests of the Garda Síochána and of retaining the confidence of the public that such relatively minor but important allegations are capable of being investigated by the Commission.  I would be concerned if we were to narrow the scope of that.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this when he responds.I was quite impressed by my meetings with the Commission, and with the calibre of the people working for it.  I would have thought it well staffed.  The Government cannot be criticised for not making the resources available —  it  has done that, in my view.  If Government has concerns about trivial, mischievous or vexatious cases, it should be possible to strip those out without taking away the obligation to investigate more routine allegations that are, nonetheless, serious matters from the point of view of the public having confidence in the Garda Síochána.  That is what this is about.Deputy Flanagan referred in passing to the Galway taxi case.  That is the kind of case that does such damage to the standing of the Garda Síochána, more than all the major eruptions we have seen in recent years.  This case deserves not to be shut down on a technicality but merits full examination and recommendations to be made by the Ombudsman Commission.  Whatever the technicality is, I hope the Minister will cause it to be put right because this type of case must be dispiriting for good policemen and policewomen.  For Gardaí coming out of Templemore fully committed to doing their best to discharge a very difficult job in the public interest, that type of incident does serious damage.  I hope the Minister will take up that point in his reply to the debate and tell us that he will protect the case, whatever the nature of the technical deficiency that shut it down.I wish Mr. Dermot Gallagher every success in his appointment as chairman.  He takes on a very important role.  I wish the Commission, an important reform, every success.  I wish to see more reports beginning to flow from the Commission as soon as possible.

Bhuail mé leis an iar Bhreitheamh Kevin Haugh cúpla uair maidir leis an Garda Ombudsman Commission.  Bhí cuma air go raibh sé dírithe ar an phost sin agus is trua go bhfuil sé imithe ar shlí na fírinne.Mar sin féin, caithfidh mé dul i gcoinne an rúin seo.  Ní locht ar bith é seo ar charachtar nó ar an obair atá déanta ag Dermot Gallagher thar na mblianta.  Bhuail mé leis cúpla uair san am sin, go háirithe nuair a bhí plé á dhéanamh againn ar Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta agus ina dhiaidh sin.  Duine lách é, a chur chuig na hoibre a bhí os a chomhair agus a d'oibrigh go maith linn.  Ach mar sin féin, is cóir cur i gcoinne an chinnidh seo de bharr an bhealach ar roghnaíodh é.  Nílim i gcoinne an duine, ach i gcoinne an phróisis roghnaithe.  Ní raibh sé ceart ná cóir, go háirithe nuair a cuirtear san áireamh cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá an post seo.  Táimidne sa Stát seo ag iarraidh a chur i gcion ar an phobal go bhfuil neamhspleáchas i gceist leis an gcoimisiún agus go seasann sé ann féin agus gur é an duine is fearr don phost a bheadh roghnaithe.The primary purpose of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the position of its chair are vital.  I remember arguing with a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, the need for a single ombudsman rather than a commission.  Obviously the position of chair involves a particular job of work.  Its purpose may be to investigate individual complaints against individual members of the Garda Síochána but there is a further objective, given the failure over the years of the Garda Complaints Board which had lost the confidence of the public.  Members of this House should look at the contributions in the debate when the Garda Ombudsman Commission was being established.Its ultimate objective is to restore public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  That is part of its role, not its sole duty.  For the Ombudsman Commission to achieve that, the public must have confidence in that very body.  It must be, and be seen to be, totally independent.   For that reason, I question whether a very recently retired, high-level Civil Servant could ever command the optimum confidence of the public in a role as an independent scrutiniser of other servants of the State.  As I stated earlier, this is not to offer opposition to the person in question but to ask if there should be a cooling off period between appointments, whether of a judge, a retired judge or a person in a position such as Mr. Gallagher held.  If there were such a cooling off period perhaps we would be in a better position today.Concerning the process of selection followed recently, I concur with the statement by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, whose director reacted to the announcement by stating, "It is very disappointing that the Government has chosen to fill this post with a retired public servant without the open and transparent recruitment process which should accompany any appointment to a body charged with the independent scrutiny of the conduct of agents of the State."In the Six Counties appointments such as this must involve the transparent, open and merit-based recruitment process and be subject to prior scrutiny by a panel that is independent of the relevant Department.  Last week I asked the Minister by way of a parliamentary question whether he agreed that similar principles should underpin key appointment processes in this State.  The Minister in his reply flatly rejected my proposal and showed himself to be out of touch from prevailing public opinions and in denial as to the systems that give rise to them.Whether fairly in some instances, or unfairly in others, the public associates many Government appointments with cronyism and jobs for the boys.  Countless e-mails, letters and telephone calls to my office are testament to that.  The source of this suspicion is systemic and must be addressed.This appointment cannot be divorced from the wider context of economic recession.  If the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is to restore confidence in the Garda, the public must have confidence in it.  The majority of people looking at this appointment, against their own background of loss of jobs and income cuts, will see it as the appointment of a high earner who on recently retiring from his position as a civil servant, received a fairly large sum and an annual pension of €120,000.  He had also been given the job of chair of the governing body of UCD and is now being appointed as chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission with a nice salary.  Even though he has indicated acceptance of a reduced level of remuneration of €90,000, this, on top of the other income, is a nice earner.  In my own area, the early focus project in the Mater Dei primary school in Basin Lane, is surviving on less than that and is currently under threat.  The slight reduction in remuneration does nothing, in my view, to restore confidence.The scarcity of resources and performance to date of the ombudsman commission has not created public confidence in the body.  It is to be hoped that as it moves forward this year, it will deliver what the public expects.  People are still waiting to see the commission flexing its muscles properly.  Suspicion about the appointment of the commission's members is something it cannot afford.The Garda Inspectorate and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission need to examine the case referred to in the House, namely, the Boylan case, which concerns a blatant and high profile informer who was allowed carry on his trade.  The Garda Síochána Inspectorate, Kathleen O'Toole's office, should be asked to examine the practice of the non-prosecution of drug dealers or other criminals and using them as informers and allowing them to continue operating with impunity.  This is the public perception.  Far too often, cases have collapsed on a technicality and the public view is that these are created technicalities to allow informers to carry on their trade, given that these people are caught in the act, caught red-handed and yet the next day they are back on the streets carrying on the same trade in full public view.There is an aspect of public confidence which needs to be addressed and restored.  Those caught red-handed should be brought before the courts and convicted and not escape on technicalities.  We need to address the ineffectiveness of the prosecuting gardaí to ensure they have the resources and the wherewithal to properly prepare cases.  We need to address the high-profile cases such as the Boylan case and other scandals.  It is a big job of work for the Garda ombudsman commission.  I have confidence in the appointment of Mr. Gallagher because he has the ability to do the job, but I will oppose the motion on the basis of the selection procedure involved.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I thank the members of the Opposition, in particular the spokespersons for Fine Gael and the Labour Party, for their approval of the nomination of Mr. Dermot Gallagher.  In reply to Deputy Ó Snodaigh and the other two Deputies opposite, the criticism that has been made of the appointment selection is ironic.  What more transparent appointment can be made than the nomination coming before the Oireachtas which is representative of the people?  The appointment is debated in the House and Members have the opportunity to express their opinions on it.  I do not accept the criticism of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in that respect.Deputies expressed the view that Government should have consulted but we followed the letter and the spirit of the law with regard to the Act passed by the Oireachtas in 2005 which stipulated the appointment would be a Government nomination and a three-stage process, including the passing of resolutions in both Houses and appointment by the President.  In my view, the Government has behaved correctly in accordance with the legislation.I refer to some of the high-profile cases which Members have raised.  This is an independent commission and for that reason it should be left to independently examine the issues referred to it.  There has been publicity about some cases in recent times.  The Boylan case was the subject of a recent "Primetime Investigates" programme.  I asked for and received an interim report from the Garda Commissioner on that case and this interim report was passed on to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  An internal Garda inquiry is ongoing and the ombudsman commission has indicated it has opened a public interest investigation on that case.  Two inquiries are ongoing, in particular the independent inquiry of the Garda ombudsman commission, and therefore it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue of the handling of informants.  He is correct in saying that as a result of the earlier reports of the Morris tribunal, a full review of the existing policy and practices was carried out and as a result of that review a new code of practice was drawn up which encompassed best police standards in the management and use of informants and this was put in place in the force in 2006.With regard to the recent case in Galway, it is inappropriate for me to comment on the specific case.  However, in the context of the legislation, and reviewing the result in that case, we are happy there is not a problem with the legislation.The commission in its February 2008 report referred to required legislative changes.  The main changes proposed included a leaseback provision whereby the commission could refer cases involving allegations of less serious criminal offences back to the Garda for investigation.I hear what Members are saying.  That is one of the reasons we have taken our time as regards the potential changes in any legislation.  Deputy Charles Flanagan asked how many times I had met the Commissioner.  I met him many times on the proposed changes, as well as the Garda Commissioner.  I strongly believe that self-regulation is not good, whether in my own or in other professions.  If an independent body is set up, it should be allowed to do its work independently.  However, a strong case has been made on the issue of minor cases and there has been a response from the Garda to that whole issue of leaseback.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to what is or what is not a minor case.  Everyone who makes a complaint believes that his or her concern constitutes a major complaint.  A judgment call must be made in this and there must be balance.I would tend to err on the side of leaving as much discretion as possible to the independent body, as set up.  At the same time, however, given that it has been inundated with a significant number of cases in its first couple of years in operation, we need to see things settling down to determine how that will pan out.  Given that it has already dealt with some 3,500 cases out of the more than 5,000 it has on its books, it is clear that it is still grappling with some 1,500, which is a substantial number.  I thank Deputy Rabbitte and accept his confirmation that the Government has allocated the necessary resources, which we believe we have, in these straitened times.The Commission has asked for other changes in the legislation.  It is only fair and proper that a balance is achieved in any proposals we bring forward.  I will listen and be amenable to suggestions from the Opposition because the House should not divide on this.

If we set up something independently to look at a profession, it is best to allow it to operate without restriction, but there are issues concerning the complexity and volume of work that needs to be addressed.  Even if we were to double or treble the resources of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, I do not know if we could still deal with the bulk of relatively minor cases.I thank Members of the House for the confidence they will place in Mr. Dermot Gallagher.  He is one of the best possible candidates that could have been chosen for this job.  I wish the Ombudsman Commission well in the future.  It is a pity that Deputy Ó Snodaigh cannot support this nomination.  It would be preferable if it was unanimous in the House.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."Notwithstanding the magnitude of the domestic and international recession and the resulting first priority of Government to stabilise the public finances, we must continue to plan for the future.  In a housing context, this preparation involves, among other issues, the provision of a modern and appropriate legislative framework to allow local authorities to carry out their functions as housing authorities.  Central to that work is a requirement to provide authorities with the tools to assess the need for housing in a fair and transparent manner, to plan how that need can best be met; and ultimately deliver and manage housing stock in a sustainable, efficient and cost effective manner.Housing is an issue that affects everyone and is critical to the wellbeing of the economy.  In these turbulent days, we are all only too familiar with the issues arising in the housing sector —  not least the human dimension of the steep downturn we are experiencing. This places a spotlight on our public policy and finances.  Are we getting value for money from our investment? Are we efficient and effective and, most importantly, are we protecting the more vulnerable sections of our society?The priority afforded by the Government to housing has been clearly articulated in several important strategic documents including Towards 2016, the National Development Plan 2007-13 and the Government's statement on housing policy, "Delivering Homes. Sustaining Communities".  We have made progress in implementing the commitments in these strategies.The increased investment by Government has allowed for both an expansion and diversification in housing support.  All the indications available to us at this stage would suggest that 2008 will be another year of significant delivery under the main housing programmes.  Expenditure in 2008 on social and affordable housing totalled some €2.4 billion and it is estimated that the needs of some 19,500 households were met in that period.I expect that the total Exchequer provision for housing in 2009 will be almost €1.6 billion and while this represents a reduction on the record provision of €1.7 billion in 2008, it is a good outcome in the current circumstances.  However, even small scale reductions present challenges for us and for local authorities in maintaining levels of activity.  We must, therefore, be creative about how we use the available resources, particularly in light of the 2008 housing needs assessment which has shown a substantial increase in net need.One way or the other, the extent of current housing need demands flexible and imaginative responses, which can be tailored to take account of changes in our operating environment.  The initiative I announced recently whereby long-term lease arrangements would be used for social housing purposes is one such response.  Targeting the right accommodation in the right locations will be crucial.  Having met these criteria, leasing will provide an opportunity for local authorities to get more for less —  to take advantage of the greater value to be had in the current market and the stock of available units.  At this time more than any other, the alignment of our social and economic objectives is vital and the deployment of units for leasing, including unsold new stock, will address a real social need while helping Ireland Inc. in a particularly difficult period.The body of legislation on housing dates back more than 40 years and has developed on a piecemeal basis.  This Bill will provide greater clarity and transparency to underpin the housing service of the future.  It will give effect to the programme of social housing reform measures outlined in "Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities".  It will provide a modern framework for the delivery and management of social housing taking account of the life cycle approach and the objective of delivering sustainable homes and communities.Specifically, the Bill will provide for a more strategic approach to delivery and management through the use of housing services plans; a more objective basis for assessing need and making allocations; and a more developed statutory basis for the rental accommodation scheme.  It will also provide the legislative framework for the incremental purchase scheme and for the adoption by housing authorities of strategies to address anti-social behaviour.The Bill, as passed by Seanad Éireann, is set out in four parts with 44 sections and three schedules and I will refer in some detail to the main provisions.With the exercise of any function it is crucially important that the structures and administrative tools are in place to guide strategic and operational activities.  Part 2 outlines, for the first time, the range of functions of housing authorities.  The Bill does not alter the basic distribution of functions across the different levels of local government but it does provide for better planning and integration of services by providing for housing services plans, which take a broader strategic perspective at county and city level.  The Bill makes it clear that the key function of housing authorities is to provide a housing service.  As section 10 outlines, this service comprises a range of different housing supports including social and affordable housing, management, maintenance and regeneration.Sections 12 and 13 deal with funding issues.  Section 12 replaces section 15 of the Housing Act 1988, listing the various types of support for which grants or subsidies may be provided by the Exchequer. Section 13 deals with resources available to local authorities from sales or clawbacks and provides that these should be placed in a single fund to be used for housing purposes with the prior approval of the Minister.Sections 14 to 18 are at the core of strategic planning and operational delivery of housing services, as defined in section 10.  They deal with the making, by local authority members, of housing services plans and with the preparation, by managers, of housing action programmes to implement these plans.The housing services plans will provide a strategic focus for the planning of housing services, including delivery and ongoing management.  The plans build on the multi-annual housing action plans introduced on an administrative basis in 2004.  These proved to be a useful tool for the integrated planning of services.  Placing them on a statutory footing will provide the necessary framework for engagement with the elected members and will also provide a link to work undertaken in preparing housing strategies in the context of development plans.Under section 14 elected members are obliged to make a housing services plan not later than six months after the current development plan is made, and section 15 sets out the matters to be taken into account including the development plan, the demand for social and affordable housing and the need to deliver housing in a way that supports sustainable communities.  Section 17 provides for a variation of the plan to be initiated by the manager or the Minister.Section 18 provides for the making of housing action programmes. The programmes will be, in effect, the delivery mechanism for the plans and will be prepared by the manager.  It is envisaged that the housing services plans will contain high level goals and objectives while precise annual targets for programmes will be set out in the housing actions programmes, which will probably be of a three year duration.  This will allow for appropriate planning of projects and also for adjustment to take account of changing needs and resources.Part 2, Chapter 3 deals with providing social housing support, which is a crucial component of the broader housing service remit of authorities.  It provides the necessary legislative underpinning to the philosophy set out in Towards 2016 and Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities that housing support should be tailored to individual needs as they evolve over their life cycle and that the delivery of such support must take account of the broader sustainable communities agenda.Section 19 updates and replaces section 56(1) of the 1966 Act and gives powers to housing authorities to purchase, build, lease etc., dwellings or sites and enter public private partnerships for the purpose of providing social housing support through a variety of methods.  In providing such accommodation, subsection (4) obliges local authorities to have regard to their housing services plans as well as ensuring that they provide a mixture of house types to meet the needs of a range of different household types and to counteract undue social segregation.An objective and consistent assessment of individual housing needs is key to providing social housing supports.  This is essential for determining a household's priority relative to the needs of other households and to identify the appropriate supports.  Section 20 is the basis for the new assessment of need and provides extensive regulatory powers to set eligibility criteria, classify need and determine the form of this assessment.Section 21 allows for the individual assessments to be summarised in a prescribed form for a variety of purposes, including the making of a housing services plan under section 16.  This will replace the current triennial assessment of need provided for in the 1988 Housing Act and provide for a more timely and clearer picture of the scale and nature of housing need in each local authority area and across the country.Linking needs, assessed in accordance with section 20, to the allocation of resources is the next step in the process.  Section 22 replaces section 11 of the Housing Act 1988 and provides housing authorities with a new approach to allocating dwellings.  The new system is an attempt to improve consistency and transparency in decision-making, provide a better fit between needs and resources and respond, as far as possible, to the expressed preferences of individual households.  Under the new approach, each authority will adopt a new allocation scheme which will allow for local discretion within the national framework.  In this way, it is hoped to strengthen the link between local needs and the subsequent provision of resources and ensure consistency in the way in which applicants for social housing are prioritised.Chapter 4 deals with the rental accommodation scheme, more commonly known as RAS.  As Deputies are aware, RAS was introduced in 2005 and is aimed at providing a new housing option for people in receipt of social welfare rent supplement who have a long-term housing need.Building on the experience of the scheme to date, sections 23 to 27 provide a comprehensive statutory framework for RAS so that it forms part of an integrated suite of social housing options.  The main building blocks of that framework are contained in sections 24 and 25.  Section 24 contains the power for a housing authority to enter into a rental accommodation availability agreement.  Under this agreement, the provider makes the accommodation available for a period either for a sitting tenant or for any tenants allocated to the property by the housing authority.  There are certain requirements to be met by the provider before entering into an agreement under subsection (2) and the terms and conditions associated with that agreement are set out in subsection (4).Section 25 deals with the tenancy agreement to be known as a chapter 4 tenancy agreement between the person making the dwelling available and the tenant.  It outlines what should be in the agreement and importantly, in subsection (5), sets out additional obligations to those under the Residential Tenancies Act. These include payment of the rent contribution to the housing authority and provisions in regard to tenancy termination under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Any breaches of these obligations can give rise to terminations.  The Bill, therefore, will provide a more developed statutory base for RAS to ensure it can continue to evolve and play an important role in broadening the range and choice of social housing options.Sections 28 to 35 also form part of the social housing governance regime dealing with local authority responsibilities regarding housing stock, including tenancy agreements, rent schemes and a new requirement to adopt anti-social behaviour strategies.  I draw the attention of Deputies to some of these provisions.Section 31 provides for an authority to make a rent scheme setting out the manner in which it will determine rents taking account of national parameters set out in regulations.  It is important to point out that the provisions do not alter the basic concept of differential rent, where rents are income-related, with provision for the temporary waiving of rent in cases of financial hardship.Section 35 requires each housing authority, by reserved function, to adopt an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock.  I suspect few Members of this House or of society generally have not experienced, directly or indirectly, some form of anti-social behaviour.  Anti-social behaviour disrupts the lives of householders and has the potential to destabilise communities.  It is important that we make progress in this area and local authorities, as landlords of some 120,000 dwellings, have a duty to secure and protect the interests of their tenants by abating and preventing such behaviour in their estates.Section 35, therefore, specifies the principal objectives of a strategy, notably the promotion of co-operation with other agencies, including the Garda.  This is crucial, as local authorities alone cannot be expected to provide comprehensive solutions to anti-social behaviour issues in their estates.  It also outlines the matters that may be dealt with in a strategy and sets out the bodies that must be consulted in drawing up a strategy.The Bill also amends the definition of anti-social behaviour in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997.  Part 5 of Schedule 2 effects the amendment to extend the definition to include damage to property and graffiti and significant impairment of the use or enjoyment of a person's home.I turn now to one of the more innovative measures contained in the Bill.  Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities made a commitment to respond to the home ownership aspirations of those who face difficulty in purchasing homes on the open market or through the affordable housing schemes by providing paths to home ownership which are additional to social housing.The incremental purchase scheme, for which provision is made in sections 36 to 41, is one such path.  It involves transferring full title of the new house to the householder on the payment to the housing authority or approved body, as appropriate, of a proportion of the purchase price.  The housing authority or approved body places a charge on the property in its favour for the portion of equity not paid for, declining over time until the charge is eliminated.  In return, the buyer pays the mortgage and accepts full responsibility for the maintenance of the home.Eligible households, as defined in section 36, include those assessed as eligible for social housing support by reference to section 20 and, subject to some conditions, existing tenants who wish to transfer to homes made available under the scheme.  Section 37 provides that incremental purchase may apply to newly-built houses by housing authorities or approved housing bodies and to new houses that are vacant or come onto the market in the coming into force of the Act.Section 38 provides the power to sell a dwelling under the arrangement by means of a transfer order and sets out the terms and conditions that should apply.  Section 39 sets out, in detail, how the incremental features of the scheme will operate.  It requires the housing authority or approved body to put a charge, by way of a charging order, on a house that it has sold under the scheme.  The charging order creates a charged share in favour of the housing authority or body, equivalent to the discount granted off the purchase price.  The charged share is reduced in equal proportions over the period of the charge.  The reduction in the charged share for the first five years of occupancy is not applied until that period has expired and the section also provides for the authority or body to clear the charge when it expires.Section 40 deals with the control on resale of incremental purchase dwellings.  If the incremental purchaser wishes to resell the house during the charge period, the housing authority or the approved body concerned has the first option of buying it at the proportion of the market value equivalent to the prevailing share of the equity that is not charged.  The resale of an incremental purchase house in the market is subject to the consent of the housing authority or body, which may refuse consent for specified reasons, including anti-social behaviour by the prospective purchaser or in the interest of good estate management.  Where an incremental purchaser resells his or her home in the market he or she must make a payment to the authority or body calculated as the proportion of the market value of the house equivalent to the prevailing charged share.The incremental purchase scheme offers a number of key benefits.  For families, the scheme offers the earliest possible start on the path to home ownership for those willing and able to undertake a house purchase.  In addition, giving the buyer responsibility for repair and maintenance of the home helps build up the householder's stake in the property.  The scheme is also structured to make it attractive for people to put down long-term roots in the community and to commit to an area, thereby contributing to more stable and integrated communities.For the State, the scheme will provide an opportunity to extract additional value for money from capital expenditure through our social housing investment programme.  It will allow for capital funding to be recycled quickly which can be then used to provide additional social housing without the need for additional Exchequer finance.  The full details of how the scheme will operate will be spelled out in regulations to be made under the Act in due course.  This is a worthwhile and innovative initiative deserving of the support of the House.The final part of the Bill deals mainly with the application of claw-back arrangements to the provision of sites for private housing and grants paid for extensions under the adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability.  In the latter case, the claw-back applies in the event of the extended dwelling being sold within five years of the grant payment while, in the case of what is known as the low cost sites scheme, the claw-back mirrors the arrangements already in place under affordable housing schemes.The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 is an important milestone in the development of housing policy.  It provides a more strategic approach to delivery and management through housing services plans and housing action programmes.  It presents a new, more objective and comprehensive basis for assessing need and allocating housing.  It provides a more effective management and control regime covering rents and tenancy arrangements and a more developed statutory basis for the rental accommodation scheme.  It is innovative as it introduces an incremental purchase scheme aimed at helping those seeking social housing support, and existing tenants, in some circumstances, to become house owners.While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, other aspects are still under development, which I hope to bring forward for consideration on Committee Stage.  As the House is aware, the drafting of workable proposals for the sale of local authority apartments has proved problematic.  My focus has been on establishing a sufficiently robust framework to allow sales to proceed, given that past endeavours had to be abandoned.  In conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, work is continuing to resolve the outstanding complex issues with a view to finalising proposals for a viable sales scheme in time for consideration during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.I am also keen to progress work on a number of other issues, including the introduction of an affordable homes purchase scheme which, in the longer term, would facilitate the purchase, through a single equity based mechanism, of property under the various affordable housing schemes.  In addition, during the Bill's passage through the Seanad there was considerable debate on providing a statutory basis for the preparation and adoption of homelessness action plans and I am also determined to bring proposals on this matter before the House.We are living in difficult economic times.  This Bill does not and cannot offer more finance to underpin the provision of social and affordable housing in this country and the Government has already demonstrated its commitment in that regard.  It does, however, define for the first time in legislation what we mean by housing services.It sets out a framework to allow for the delivery of these services in a way that meets individual needs, but respects the concept of developing sustainable communities and provides for a system where individuals and households are dealt with fairly and consistently across the country.  It describes, in detail, how rental accommodation and incremental purchase arrangements are to be undertaken and prepares the groundwork for dealing with anti-social behaviour.It is a forward-looking Bill which recognises the complex and changing needs of the household and the variety of mechanisms required to meet those needs.  I commend it to the House.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is long overdue.  I welcome it but note it is deficient in many areas.  Homelessness does not seem to feature prominently in the Bill and details regarding the delivery of much needed social housing are vague.  During the course of my contribution I will outline some amendments which I request the Minister of State to take on board before the Bill is finalised.  Fine Gael will table more amendments on Committee Stage.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for housing policy and states its aim is to provide affordable housing to every household.  Sadly, Fianna Fáil's housing policy over the past ten years has failed.  It has not provided affordable housing for many people and now, unfortunately, many people find themselves and their homes in negative equity.  More than 100,000 people are in this situation, which is disgraceful.The Bill introduces, for the first time, a new incremental purchase scheme which the Minister of State described as very innovative, and that is to be welcomed.  It will help to promote home ownership for existing social housing tenants whose income is too low to qualify for affordable housing.  I welcome this scheme, which reflects Fine Gael policy and thinking in this area.  Under the scheme the home owner will, for the first time, have full responsibility for the property from day one.  If a person owns a property he or she will respect it much more than if he or she is in a home which is rented from the local authority.Local authorities will no longer have responsibility for maintenance of the house and, therefore, will be able to save on expenditure.  In addition, capital moneys received from purchasers can be reinvested to provide more social housing without the need for extra Exchequer funding, and that is to be welcomed.The Bill is necessary because the Government has failed to deliver promised social and affordable housing.  The collapse of the construction industry, caused by the Taoiseach's boom and bust economics, has made the delivery of new social and affordable housing difficult.  The legislation does not address the issue of purchasing local authority flats.  This is a major issue in Dublin where there are many local authority flat complexes.  Long-standing residents must have the opportunity to purchase their homes and they cannot be left to pay rent indefinitely and, perhaps, after 30 years, still not own their property.  I welcome the fact that the Attorney General is addressing the issue and will make a final decision and that the Minister of State hopes he will be enabled to provide for the purchase of flats by local authority tenants.The Bill attempts to deal with anti-social behaviour, which is welcome, because it is the scourge of many communities throughout the country.  Local authorities currently tackle such behaviour by threatening eviction or evicting residents.  The legislation will enhance the power of local authorities to handle this widespread problem.  The definition of "anti-social behaviour" will be broadened to include behaviour that causes damage to a person's home or impairs the enjoyment of his or her home.  Local authorities will be more proactive in this area because they will be permitted to vet potential residents and exclude tenants who engage in, or who have engaged in, anti-social behaviour and who are on housing waiting lists.  Section 34 requires that every housing authority adopts an anti-social behaviour strategy within a year, which will ensure a more co-ordinated approach.  There will be improved co-operation with the Garda to ensure such behaviour does not take place.The cost of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, has spiralled through the roof over the past five years.  It cost the HSE €441 million in 2008, which is a sizeable sum to pay to rent housing without the State taking ownership of it.  This issue must be examined more closely in next month's budget, as no value for money is provided through this scheme.  The Minister of State has proposed an additional rental scheme, under which €20 million will be invested to rent 2,000 housing units for between ten and 20 years.  This is the wrong policy to adopt because renting does not provide permanent housing for those on the local authority waiting lists and developers will only have guaranteed rental income for between ten and 20 years.  The interest of the tenant should be sacrosanct.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the new rental scheme?  Will it be confined to 2,000 units or will a larger scheme be rolled out to rent more properties?In 2004, the National Economic and Social Council highlighted a number of problems associated with the RAS, which need to be taken into account, including the insecurity of tenure compared to local authority social housing and the potential stigma attached if particular buildings become identified with the scheme.  The Bill does not make provision to review the scheme, which is a serious flaw.  The scheme needs to be urgently reviewed and it should continue to be reviewed on a six-monthly basis.We have a housing crisis in Ireland.  More than 56,000 people are on social housing lists.  This a shockingly high figure, when one considers the boom experienced in the State over the past ten to 15 years and the resources that were available to deal with these lists.  However, they are a direct consequence of inaction.  I am also concerned that the numbers will continue to increase given the number of houses being repossessed.  The Minister of State must consider a longer moratorium for homeowners who get into difficulty than the six-month period provided under the recapitalisation scheme.  The moratorium should be extended to two years to give them breathing space during these difficult times.I am appalled at the latest available figures, which indicate that more than 5,000 local authority houses are vacant.  The failure to turn around properties in a timely manner does not help, with more than 56,000 currently on waiting lists.  The Minister of State needs to issue a clear directive to local authorities to turn properties around in a timely manner.  In my constituency of Dublin North East, at least 80 houses are boarded up.  Last week I was contacted by a resident who mentioned that the property next door to her has been boarded up for the past two years.  The system is failing if houses are being boarded up while people on waiting lists are not being housed.  The Minister of State needs to provide 15,000 additional houses annually over the next four years to reduce waiting lists.  Questions need to be answered as to why he is handing money over to local authorities without introducing regular checks on performance delivery.  At the very least, strict targets on social housing delivery need to be set for them.The legislation does not adequately address the maintenance and regeneration of social housing estates.  Throughout the country social housing estates are in dire need of regeneration.  Many estates in my constituency need to be regenerated.  The Government has failed to deliver on regeneration schemes for Dublin.  Last December, the assigned property developer pulled out of the Croke Villas public private partnership, PPP, which was to build 30 badly needed social housing units.  In addition, Bernard McNamara pulled out of five PPP projects leaving residents devastated in various parts of the city.  Dublin City Council lost €5 million in the process and will now only proceed with three projects.  To add insult to injury, residents are in limbo until 2010 and 2011 when these projects are supposed to commence and this is a serious blow to them.  This should not have happened.  Unfortunately, the less well off in society are always the first to suffer in such a scenario and we need to learn from these examples to ensure strict penalties are imposed on developers who renege on their planning conditions and the problems with these PPPs are not repeated elsewhere.The omission of provisions to deal with homelessness is a major oversight in the Bill.  The Make Room campaign has been active in this area, issuing many e-mails to notify Members about the difficulties and problems in this area.  The four organisations involved need to be commended for the work they have done to tackle homelessness, as they are trying to eradicate the problem.  Their campaign is designed to ensure the Minister's strategy, The Way Home, is included in the legislation so that local action plans and fora on homelessness are put on a statutory footing and the rights of homeless people are vindicated.  The organisations seek a new legal definition of "homelessness" and standardisation of housing needs assessments and local authority allocation schemes.Homelessness is still a problem with more than 5,000 people homeless in the State.  This figure is probably not accurate, as it does not take into account the invisible homeless people.  I remain unconvinced that the Government will deliver on its promise to end homelessness.  For instance, last July the HSE imposed a funding freeze on services for homeless people leading to people being turned away from emergency accommodation, which is shameful.  It is a scandal that local authorities can build shelters and facilities for homeless people, which remain closed because the HSE refuses to pay to staff them.  Homeless services should be moved under the authority of one agency or Government branch.  The current flawed system allows them to fall between the cracks.  The Fine Gael Party is seeking to have this matter addressed and it will be contained in our future policy document on local government reform.The Government has failed to deliver on affordable housing.  Under the programme for Government and the national development plan, 17,000 affordable houses were to be delivered between the years 2007 and 2009.  In 2007, only 3,500 units were delivered.  In the first nine months of 2008, only 3,274 houses were delivered.  The local authorities should have received a large kick-back under Part V, but that measure gave developers an opportunity to pay cash in lieu of providing housing.  In this light, it is no wonder that waiting lists for housing are so high.  Will the Minister of State comment on Part V's failure and detail the plans to change it?  More than 6,500 people are on Dublin City Council's affordable housing list and 732 on Fingal County Council's list.The affordable housing scheme poses another serious problem.  As market prices have decreased, it has become cheaper for some people to buy homes on the open market instead of via the scheme.  Consequently, there are large-scale rejections of offers by local authorities.  Fine Gael wants them to decrease or discount their prices so that affordable housing can again become attractive.  Dublin City Council and Meath County Council should be commended on reducing their prices, but we need a ministerial directive to ensure that all local authorities will follow suit and make affordable housing affordable once again.In budget 2009, the Government's equity scheme was introduced.  Through it, the Government will acquire a stake in a property based on a house's market value.  The equity stake of 25% to 30% will leave the buyer vulnerable if market prices increase during the house's sale.  While this scheme is intended to replace the affordable housing scheme and its full details are still to be ironed out, we must ensure that people are not hit unfairly when they sell property.The Government also introduced a home choice loan scheme to provide up to 92% of the market value of a new property for first-time buyers unable to obtain loans from banks.  Fine Gael has opposed the scheme from the beginning because it encourages people to borrow up to seven times the value of their salaries, potentially trapping them in bad debt and negative equity, given the decline in the housing market.Initiatives to help first-time buyers are welcome and should be encouraged, but the scheme's timing is wrong.  The scheme is unsuitable.  It is also questionable in that it only seems to relate to new homes.  Many have asked why it does not relate to second-hand homes.  That only four people have so far applied shows the concerns over the housing market.  They are waiting to see when the market will level out.  Current predictions put that at another 12 or 18 months.  This is a major reason for people staying away from the home choice loan scheme.Section 14 deals with the housing service plans.  Housing authorities must provide a housing services plan outlining their aims in providing those services.  Section 15(2) states that the Minister may direct local authorities to include in the plan details of the quality of housing owned and plans for regeneration.  Fine Gael seeks to insert an amendment to make these conditions compulsory.  The Minister states that the plan should last for the duration of each council's development plan.  Fine Gael wants compulsory six-month reviews of those plans so that they stay relevant.There are many problems regarding the allocation of social housing.  Many view the allocation system as unfair and not transparent.  An amendment has been suggested by the MakeRoom Alliance, which comprises Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold.  It wants regulations for an allocation system for dwellings.  Each local authority approaches housing lists and allocations in a different manner, but the alliance wants consistency in this vital State service.The Minister of State must lay the draft regulations before the relevant Oireachtas committee for debate, the recommendations of which he should consider before signing final regulations.  Members of the committee remain in close contact with many of the people that these regulations are trying to help and could provide constructive suggestions to amend the draft regulations.For the past ten years, the housing boom witnessed developers building estates without providing necessary facilities, which should have been stipulated in planning permissions.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government informs us that this matter will be addressed under the new planning Bill, which is yet to be introduced in the House.  However, nothing is to be done to address the problem of estates that have been left unfinished.  Many legacy housing estates were built during the Celtic tiger years.  Their problems with roads and inadequate foot paths and facilities must be addressed.Power should be given to local authorities to address this problem in the new planning Bill.  In my constituency, a DART station is yet to be provided at Clongriffin, yet it was a stipulation of the planning permission that, once 1,000 had moved into the area, a DART station would be up and running.  Thousands of people have moved into the area in the past five years or so, yet there is no station.  A town centre was promised to those who bought homes in Belmayne, a new development.  However, the plan collapsed because the developer claimed that he had no money, leaving residents high and dry.  They were promised proper shopping and civic centres.  Many questions remain unanswered.Some 300 recorded unfinished estates should have been completed two years ago to taking-in-charge standards, but there is no sign of completion dates for them.  Unfortunately, unfinished roads and facilities appear to be the norm, with many new housing estates remaining in bad conditions.  Under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, a local authority must, if requested to do so by a majority of owners and occupiers, take in charge an estate that has been completed to the standard required.  Clearly, this is a provision of which home owners are not aware.  It must be communicated to them.Standard taking-in-charge policies need to be followed by all local authorities.  In terms of taking estates in charge, the enforcement timeframe also needs to be reduced from seven to four years.  Heavy penalties must be imposed on developers who fail to complete housing estates in a timely manner.  Local authorities must be more proactive in monitoring all housing developments in their areas.  They must also send information to residents explaining the taking-in-charge process.Moreover, the Bill does not address the issue of property management companies and the problems associated with them.  Apartment living in Ireland is flawed and the Government has failed to introduce measures that would protect apartment owners from management companies.  Although more than half a million people live in apartments and there are more than 4,600 property management companies, no legislation governs such companies at present.  Apartment owners nationwide experience constant frustration with their property agents.  Many homeowners are being ripped off to the tune of thousands of euro and receive very little service for the money they are paying.  In the present economic climate in which people are looking much more closely at their payslips and outgoings, they question the outgoings they pay to property management companies.The absence of regulation in this regard is a disgrace and a scandal and homeowners must be protected from the lack of regulation and accountability in the sector.  For example, annual general meetings are not taking place in many such complexes, the residents are unsure of their rights and are unsure to whom they should turn if they experience problems with their property management agents or companies.  Unfortunately, many unscrupulous practices are in operation within this industry and many owners are in the hands of cowboys, who appear to raise service level fees as they wish.  Clearly, no basic communication is taking place between property management companies and homeowners or between management companies and agents.  Meetings are not being held with residents to inform them on the uses to which their fees are being put or the extant difficulties within such complexes.  This entire issue is a can of worms that has not been tackled over the last ten to 15 years.  It is an area that Fine Gael has raised constantly and on which it has sought the introduction of the necessary legislation.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will be able to expedite legislation in this regard.The Government set up the National Property Services Regulatory Authority in 2005, to which a director was appointed in July 2006.  The authority has acquired a permanent premises in Navan and a staff and has been allocated a budget of €700,000 and €930,000 in 2007 and 2008, respectively.  While I am uncertain as to its budget allocation for 2009, the authority has no statutory footing and is toothless.  I believe it is engaged in some preparatory work in this area but there has been little communication as to current developments in respect of this authority.  The authority's lack of statutory powers ultimately must be addressed.I understand that two Bills are forthcoming in this area.  The property services regulatory authority Bill will put the aforementioned regulatory authority on a statutory footing.  There also has been discussion of a multi-unit development Bill, for the purpose of dealing specifically with issues pertaining to the property management companies.  The other Bill will deal with the regulation of estate agents and so on.  The Minister of State should provide clarification and an update in respect of developments and should provide Members with a timeframe and some hope in order that they can inform people that their issues with management companies are being taken on board and soon will be addressed by the Government.The Bill does not address the fire safety issues that exist in many flats and apartments throughout the city and I am extremely concerned about fire safety matters in apartment complexes.  In October 2008, a fire broke out at 4:30 a.m. in an apartment complex in Clongriffin, which is located in my constituency.  The fire is believed to have been started by mindless thugs who set alight industrial bins in the car park.  Shockingly however, no fire alarm went off in the apartment complex when the bins were set ablaze.  Had a few residents not been returning home from a previous evening out, who were able to inform and evacuate the complex's other residents, the outcome could have been far worse.  Moreover, the fire brigade had difficulty in gaining access to the complex.  Many such complexes are gated and the fire brigade does not have the codes with which to gain access to tackle a fire.  This is a major issue that must be examined.This complex contains neither fire extinguishers nor blankets on each floor and the fact that the fire alarm was not working raises many questions.  This apartment complex received a fire compliance certificate from the local authority, which is highly worrying.  Certificates are being given to apartment complexes that contain no fire fighting equipment.  Alarms are not being tested on a regular basis to ensure they are properly functioning and fire drills do not take place in many of these complexes.  Unfortunately, residents do not know who are their neighbours and there are no fire marshals or wardens on the floors.  This issue is a ticking time bomb and ultimately, it must be addressed.Legislation must be urgently drawn up in respect of property management companies and fire safety matters.  The Government must perform an audit to ascertain how many apartment complexes have in place inadequate fire prevention equipment.  Fine Gael seeks amendments, either through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill or through the fire safety Acts, which will state in law that management agents or management companies have a duty to check on a weekly basis that all fire safety equipment is present in buildings and is operational.  Moreover, such amendments should state that fire evacuation plans must be placed on all floors in apartment complexes and that fire drills must take place on a more regular basis.The Government has failed to ensure that rental properties are inspected on a regular basis.  In 2006, only 3% of all rental properties were inspected.  Although the Minister of State has brought forward measures to deal with rental accommodation that came into effect from 1 February last and which deals with the issue of bedsits, 78% of private rented properties in the area under Dublin City Council's remit did not comply with basic legal minimum standards, according to the Centre for Housing Research.  Greatly increased levels of inspections are required and if the Minister of State is serious in this regard, he will ensure that yearly inspections take place of all properties nationwide.  He also will ensure that fines are increased severely and not simply by €2,000, which already has taken place.  One must ensure that local authorities are on top of their brief in this regard and that they ensure that people are not being hit or being put into poor properties.

While the Minister of State has not been in office for all that time, one issue that will not be forgiven pertains to talking up the property market.  More than 100,000 people now find themselves in negative equity and they will not forget.  I look forward to debating the further Stages of the Bill.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I welcome the long-awaited Second Stage Dáil debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Bill provides Members with an opportunity to develop an expanded programme for social housing, new measures to deal with the problem of homelessness, stronger protection for tenants in rented accommodation, measures to combat anti-social behaviour in housing estates, as well as legislation to regulate the activities of management companies or to give an indication in that direction.There are more people than ever on social housing lists, an unprecedented number of families face the threat of having their homes repossessed and the level of homelessness is a high as ever.  Recently published data show the social housing waiting list has increased in the past three years from 43,700 to nearly 60,000.  These truly shocking figures show the extent to which Fianna Fáil has squandered the boom, leaving tens of thousands of people high and dry without adequate housing.  An expanded social housing programme would not only provide families with badly needed accommodation but would help to kick-start the construction sector.No Member of this House needs to be reminded of the unacceptable level of homelessness.  Every evening as we leave this House, we see the people huddled in porches and alleyways around Kildare Street and Merrion Square.  It is shocking that, on average, 5,000 people are experiencing homelessness at any one time.  What is even more shocking is that 487 of them are under the age of 18.This Bill comes before the House against the background of the increase in the numbers on the social housing list from 43,700 to almost 60,000 and the continuing problem of homelessness.  There must be an effective inspection regime for housing standards in the private rental sector.  Residents in both apartments and housing estates face ongoing difficulties as a result of the unregulated operation of management companies and the failure of the Government to honour the commitment in the programme for Government to expand the delivery of social and affordable housing options to meet the needs of almost 90,000 households.In the course of this debate, I will put forward a series of amendments on behalf of the Labour Party.  Among these, I will propose that steps be taken to ensure, where possible, that existing unsold housing units are secured for the purpose of social housing.  The Labour Party proposes that we make rent supplement more employment-friendly by bringing means assessment into line with differential rent schemes, enhance families' access to rental accommodation schemes, and adequately resource and fully implement The Way Home, the Government's strategy to address adult homelessness.  We must amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide for the creation of a national inspection regime in respect of housing standards in the rental sector, along with the provision of definitive and efficient timeframes within which disputes should be resolved.  At present, such disputes can take 18 months or more to be concluded.  We must also reform the law on multi-unit developments, including apartment developments; strengthen the powers of local authorities to deal with anti-social behaviour; and broaden the terms of the tenant purchase scheme allowing local authority tenants the right to buy their apartments.A housing crisis can be defined in different ways.  In one sense, there has been a housing crisis in this State for the past ten years.  It is a question of priorities and policies.  Do we see houses as commodities or homes?  Do we want to build developments or do we want to create and sustain communities?  Do we want developer-led government or government-led development?  When this Government came to power, the average house price was approximately three times the income of a working family, spread over a 20-year mortgage.  Just before the housing pyramid collapsed, the cost of an average house had increased to 12 times the average income, with a mortgage of more than 30 years the norm.In the period 1997 to 2007, residential mortgage debt increased by an extraordinary 522%.  Many people made money from home buyers as the market rose.  Many will continue to make money as these mortgages are paid off in the coming decades.  Hard-working families and couples have been fleeced in the past decade.  A system was in place, facilitated by the Government, which saw massive loans being given to developers to purchase properties at over-inflated prices, with a transference of the financial cost and, more specifically, the financial liability, down the line to first-time buyers.  Hence, we had a massive percentage increase in the cost of buying a home when measured against income and almost a doubling in the scheduling of mortgage repayments from 20 years to 35 years.  That has been the significant aspect of the Government's social housing policy in the past ten years.How did this happen?  The answer is simple.  Those who had a duty of care, including the Government, regulators and banking institutions, all neglected that duty with the result that this country's future was invested in a property bubble.  An example of this mind set was best captured in April 2006 when then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, referred to the "health" of the housing market and sneered at economists who predicted a collapse.  With his chest puffed out on the "Six One News", he proudly proclaimed that people who listened to the "lulas" would miss the boat and would have to pay more for their houses.  This was frightening talk then and it is even more frightening with the benefit of hindsight.  It was the mantra of the dodgy salesman encouraging people to buy a dodgy product at an over-inflated price.It did not matter to the former Taoiseach or his Government that the cost of buying a home was running beyond the grasp of working people.  It did not matter that families were being locked into mortgages that would take their entire working lives to clear.  Nor was the Government concerned, in those sunny days, that people would be in danger of losing their homes, when the rainy day inevitably came, because of the reckless practices it allowed to continue.This Bill affords us an opportunity, once and for all, to banish the mind set that the primary purpose of housing development is profit for speculators.  If the Bill is to succeed, it must be based on the principle that housing development, whether private or public, is about long-term security, that is, meeting the needs of society in providing people with homes of a quality standard, at an affordable price.  The consistent theme in recent years has been the focus of the Fianna Fáil developer-led Government on sorting out the developers and getting new developments built.  Such issues as schools, transportation, green spaces and common areas would be sorted out at some time in the future.Figures I have obtained, and to which I have referred repeatedly in this House, show that less than one in ten homes in the private rental sector are inspected to ascertain their compliance with standards.  Figures produced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, show that only 12,000, or just over 6%, out of 188,000 registered private rented dwellings were inspected in 2007.  The figures for 2008 are not much better.  Of the 12,000 inspected in 2007, 2,379 were found to be substandard.  However, legal action ensued in only 25 cases, or a fraction of 1% of the total number.Earlier this year the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, issued guidelines and referred to a dedicated stream of money for local authorities to carry out inspections.  However, neither the determination nor the powers to ensure inspections are carried out and standards enforced have been put in place.  Despite promises of legislation, vulnerable private tenants are left without adequate protection because guidelines and standards only matter if proper enforcement is organised.Like social housing, the private rental sector fulfils an important function, providing necessary housing for hundreds of thousands of people.  Without question, the majority of landlords are compliant.  In many cases, were it not for the private rental market many people could not find housing because of the absence of a clear strategic social housing programme over the past number of years.  However it is unacceptable that, despite the legislation governing private residential tenancies and the promise of more legislation this year, adequate enforcement of standards does not take place.  This is something the Minister of State is examining and I emphasise the urgency of the matter.There is blatant avoidance of registration by landlords in the private rental sector by choosing to opt into licensee agreements.  This is openly advertised on the IPA website and it is an encouragement to undermine the legislation.  I suggest the Minister of State corrects this anomaly immediately and substantially increases the fines for landlord actively avoiding registration because of this loophole.  A national inspection regime is required to ensure standards in private rented accommodation and social housing are enforced.  This would guarantee the establishment of effective and efficient timeframes in which disputes could be resolved.  Local authorities could determine an acceptable period in which urgent repairs should be carried out.Every Member of this House, particularly those who have served on local authorities, is aware of two difficulties in social housing.  One is the turnaround period after a property comes back into the possession of a local authority and before it is reallocated.  It is not unusual for this delay to run to years.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State to penalise local authorities that facilitate such delays when the work can be done.  When a house becomes available in a local authority housing estate, which had been purchased through the tenant purchase scheme, the house is in immaculate condition on the day it is purchased and a tenant could move in on the same afternoon.  For some reason, it takes months or years to turn these properties around and one can question the quality of work done in some of the houses.  They seem to be allocated in poorer condition than when they came back to the local authority.The second matter related to urgent and necessary household repairs.  Local authorities should be issued with more than guidelines, perhaps a directive, so that if an elderly person or someone with a disability has a major housing repair requirement, this person is not waiting up to 12 months.  There should be a specific timeframe in which to deal with this work.  If something similar to the National Treatment Purchase Fund is required, whereby the local authority must look outside its capacity to carry out this improvement, so be it.  Just like any landlord, local authorities have landlord obligations to their tenants.  If we do not accept low standards in the private rental sector, why should we accept low standards in the public housing sector?The problems relating to management companies are well understood and have been analysed by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  These companies, many of which were set up by developers, need to be regulated in the interests of the residents not the developers.  In the absence of overdue legislation this problem has grown particularly acute where people are being held to ransom by these companies with no come-back and no Government support.  Despite successive promises, there has been no regulator and no legislation brought forward by the Government.  Homeowners have been abandoned by the Government and they find themselves on their own when a management company or agent provides a bad service.The fact that these companies are currently in a legal no-man's land is causing endless trouble for affected residents.  For several years, the Government has talked about the need for legislation in this area but we are continually fobbed off with policy reviews and committee meetings.  Much talk has come from Government about this issue.  What is needed is less conversation from this Government and more action.This Bill is long-awaited and I envisage it will be significantly different by the time we get to Report State.  I hope the Bill will remedy some priority issues if it cannot remedy most difficulties.  It is very disappointing that when first published the Bill made no reference to homelessness.  In later drafts homelessness was mentioned.  I hope this was the result of an oversight by the Minister and the Department rather than an indication that homelessness is not a priority for them.The response in the Bill to anti-social behaviour raises many questions.  It appears to provide an additional load of bureaucratic nonsense for local authorities while giving them no additional powers.  All this will do is further increase the frustration that currently exists when residents make a complaint and find their situation is no better, if not worse, at the end of a long and futile merry-go-round.  We need legislative changes in penalising people who engage in anti-social behaviour, not broadening the scope of bureaucratic activity for local authority officers.The Bill stands indicted for showing that the mentality of the Galway tent is still alive and well when it comes to the promotion of tenant purchase.  The significant changes in this area are targeted towards shifting property to what is described as new build.  This is code for empty housing estates built in areas without proper facilities or resources, which are now abandoned and may be filled due to ongoing lobbying of the Government by the Construction Industry Federation.  This means there will be no incentive to regenerate existing communities through incentivising tenants to purchase their existing homes.  With the exception of the established tenant purchase scheme, we are now seeing a movement of incentivisation of tenant purchase exclusively to the new build.  When this is decoded, it refers to empty houses.The Bill could well create a repeat of the circumstances of the 1980s, which led to an exodus of earning residents from local authority estates.  To this day we are still picking up the pieces and paying the price of that mistake both in societal and financial costs.In its current format, the Bill continues to leave tenants of local authority flats, who for years have been left in the lurch, without the right to buy their own home.  The Minister has spoken about the requirement of a legislative framework for this to happen and this has been before the Attorney General.  It has been indicated that on Committee Stage, amendments will be introduced.  It is critical that the Minister, in his response to the debate, gives a clear commitment that such amendments will be included on Committee Stage.People have been waiting for ten or 15 years or even longer to have the right to buy the home in which they live.  That right is afforded to every other local authority tenant living in a house but not those prohibited from it because they live in a flat.  Over that period, people have grown older and because mortgage schedules must be completed within one's working life, if somebody is 50 when trying to buy the flat, he or she only has 16 years to purchase it.  If this anomaly is corrected, an opportunity which could have been put in place a number of years ago will unfortunately not be available to those people.The Minister has talked about new builds and intends to introduce a purchase scheme confined to new builds, where people assessed for social housing can get a loan up to €285,000 from a local authority once they have been refused a mortgage by two lending institutions.  This is ironically called the home choice purchase scheme.  Everybody knows, particularly in recent months, that there are two reasons for refusing a mortgage.  One is that the evidence indicates the prospective mortgagee will not be able to pay back a loan, and the second is that a property could be overvalued.What purpose does this scheme serve other than to provide a sub-prime lending service and set a false floor price for new houses in a declining but still overvalued property market?  There is a duty of care issue in this which I have put to the Minister, and I would like him to expand upon it.  Given that there are performance and bonus payments to local authority officials, will this scheme be tied to bonuses?A prospective house buyer may go to two banks and be refused because the banks, on good grounds, turn down the application after considering wages and seeing that the loan amount cannot be repaid or that a property is overvalued.  If that person goes to a local authority and acquires a loan, will the person signing off on that loan receive a bonus at the end of the year because he or she has completed so many transactions within a schedule?  If that is the case, serious questions must be asked.  The Minister should send out a directive to those who put performance bonuses in place to prohibit such activity.  The scheme should be banned in its entirety but if the Minister proceeds, it is critical that a bonus is not in place for local authority officials in facilitating the scheme.This country is no longer as wealthy as it used to be but it is wealthy enough to be ashamed of its record on homelessness.  With housing vacancy rates in Ireland at 15%, it is unacceptable that 5,000 people were homeless in Ireland last winter.  We need a strategy to enable homeless people to make the successful transition from temporary emergency shelter to long-term accommodation.  There is a specific role for the voluntary housing sector in collaboration with local authorities and the Minister's Department to move on the issue.This can only be done with the proper rehabilitation processes in place, which would require a cross-departmental and inter-agency report involving the Department of Education and Science, the VECs, health agencies and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is a significant opportunity to act on this and the Government must take immediate action, starting with the implementation of a national strategy on homelessness, if we are to eventually see the end of the scandalous situation of 55% of people in emergency accommodation being stuck there for three or more years.  There is something radically wrong if we are only dealing with shelter accommodation at the crisis end of the homelessness issue rather than moving people into long-term sustainable housing approaches.I have some recent figures relating to the past three years in Dublin.  In 2006, 1,615 presentations were made with regard to homelessness.  An additional 280 presentations were already in the system, meaning the total was almost 2,000 people in the Dublin region being categorised, in some way or other, as being homeless.  In 2007, there were just over 1,000 new people coming into the registration process.  In 2008, a further 1,100 came in.I welcome the fact that the Department has eventually moved on this but we need a definition of homelessness.  I will table an amendment for the Minister's consideration when we get to this aspect of the Bill.  If we need one thing on this matter, we certainly need a definition of homelessness if we are to resolve the problem.The affordable homes issue also came up in the course of this debate and there is a difficulty out there.  I will cite one example.  A couple came to see me recently who were involved in the affordable homes scheme with Cork County Council.  They were given a mortgage in principle for €250,000 by the council, as their earnings showed they could borrow that amount.  They were told by the council that they would be granted a house in a scheme that had just been completed with a purchase price of €216,000, well within their mortgage in principle.The couple went about the business of buying the property only to discover that when the lending institution examined the property, its value was €196,000, some €20,000 below what the council was selling it for.  This will be a recurring difficulty and I stress to the Minister the need to ensure there is an examination of how the affordable housing product was put on the market.  The prices were decided two years ago in a declining market, which has changed radically.  We may well have a case where people will vote with their feet and the affordable housing programme, as it is currently, will come to a standstill, particularly with the introduction of the incremental purchase scheme.  When that is introduced, it will be a far more favourable option to the existing affordable housing scheme.Even in today's falling housing market, couples find that the cost of buying a home can still exceed their ability to pay and house prices are still over inflated.  People are on a social housing list, given the unemployment figures received in this House yesterday, are increasingly finding that the list has grown longer and their place on it may be further down.  For too long under this Government housing development and housing policy have been driven by the needs of everyone except home developers.  I hope this Bill will show a clear change in direction in that respect.  We need change badly, and it is time the House made those changes.Under this Bill we have the choice to build communities and not housing developments.  We can look beyond the bricks and mortar and insist that in future housing is built to sustain communities.  We can insist on a housing programme that will enable purchasers to buy homes and not to trade in commodities.Since I was elected to this House, I have asked when this Bill will come before it.  I welcome the fact that we are now dealing with it.  I acknowledge that since it was introduced in the Seanad significant changes have occurred in the economy and certain measures will have to be introduced in the Bill.  However, there are fundamental aspects of it, regardless of whether the economy is buoyant or in a downturn, namely, good standards and long-term planning are critical to any housing programme.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State will bring forward a series of amendments on Committee Stage.  I look forward to examining those and will support those that will greatly improve the provision of housing in this State.  The Labour Party will also bring forward amendments, to which I hope the Minister of State will give due consideration.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I, too, am pleased to welcome this Bill following its long passage through the Seanad.  By chance I hit upon some of the contributions made in the Seanad.  It received detailed scrutiny there and worthwhile suggestions were put forward, particularly on dealing with the issue of homelessness on which I will comment later.I very much approve of a Bill of this nature.  It seeks to bring together some of the many changes that have happened in housing in recent years and to put some of them on a statutory footing.  It is a forward looking Bill.  As the Minister of State and those of us who are public representatives and deal with housing matters will be aware, housing is an issue that is constantly presented to us, regardless of what changes are made or what new and innovative measures are introduced.  I very much appreciate now, as I did many years ago when I was a local authority member, that the mind set of the Department, which may have been termed the Department of Local Government then, was innovative, as were county managers and housing officers in dealing with housing needs of people.  Housing needs constantly change.  People's housing needs are complex and they change against the backdrop of changes in society.It was interesting to read the Minister of State's contribution and to hear the excellent contributions of the two Members who have spoken thus far in the debate.  I was a secondary school teacher when I became involved in politics at local authority level many years ago and I recall thinking at the time that if everybody had the chance of a good education, the world would right itself.  I later began to think that as well as a good education everybody should have the opportunity to have a decent house and that if they had a good education and a decent house, they would be set on a fair path in life.  I have not altered my mind on those matters.  Increasingly more people come to see me about housing matters.  Members may well say they are matters for local authority members and they may ask why am I dealing with them.  Be that as it may, I want to deal with them because I am intensely interested in housing and in ensuring that people get a chance to set themselves up in a decent house and can avail of the various schemes available.This is a time of economic stringency and the Minister of State stated that openly.  He said this Bill was being introduced against a background of strong housing provision in 2008 and equally strong provision, albeit by a small margin, in 2009.  There will not be a bottomless pit in terms of such provision, therefore, it is important that departmental officials and ministerial officials adopt an innovative approach to overcoming difficulties.  As the Minister said, there should be a modern and an appropriate legislative framework in place to allow local authorities to carry out their functions as housing authorities.  The implementation of new schemes is often imposed on local authorities.  When the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, was introduced, I recall local authorities were simply told it was a new scheme that was been implemented.  This legislation is well thought out and all the new schemes will be put on a statutory footing.  They can then be expanded or deleted as required.  I very much like the way the functions of the housing authority are set out in the Bill, as well as the housing services plan.  Those provisions are useful.  Local authority members will now have a strong say and will provide the basis for the managerial carry through of housing action programmes.  The programmes will be the delivery mechanism of the plans and will be prepared by the manager, but the basis of the plans will have been agreed by the local authority members.  That is also a positive aspect.Putting the rental accommodation scheme on a statutory footing is a good measure.  Not enough people know about it.  Local authority staff in town halls and county council offices will advise clients about it.  However, when this Bill, as amended, is passed in this House and ratified in the Seanad, it would be useful for the Minister of State and his Department to issue a comprehensive booklet detailing the various schemes available through housing authorities at town hall or county council level, setting out that they have a statutory framework and how the people can inquire about them.  The Minister of State's Department is good at doing that.I have dealt with some clients who did not know about the RAS scheme.  It was introduced at the end of 2005 or early 2006, but it has not been utilised enough.  When I mention it to people, they appear not to have heard of it.  Local authority officials will explain it to people.  It is a good scheme.  It gives a sitting tenant or a person on the social housing list a chance of getting decent housing and it has the added bonus that the landlord is spancelled in terms of what he can charge in rent, which is a good feature of the scheme.When the affordable housing scheme was introduced, around the same time as RAS, five or six years ago, it was hailed as a good idea, which it was.  It caught people's imagination and was the flavour of the month.  People were in full employment and could consider purchasing an affordable home.  Two factors arose, namely, the boom in the economy which enabled a person who was earning enough money to purchase his or her own home and the fact that the council could supply the home under the affordable housing scheme.  I have two caveats.  First, that was then and this is now.  There is no doubt that in a time of declining employment I am coming across people in difficulties regarding the affordable housing scheme.  At least they are with the local authority which will have a measure of justice and approachability in dealing with people getting into difficulties.  There is a particular caveat I have in mind.  I do not ever think the affordable housing scheme should be part of a giant local authority housing scheme with a very large number of housing units.  I am aware of one such scheme that has not worked out.  I know the original idea was to have social housing and affordable housing cheek by jowl very happy —  they are not.  In many cases people tell me they would love their houses if they could bring them somewhere else.  That is not possible, as we know.  I agree it was a fine philosophical point to have affordable and social housing side-by-side.  While I accept it is accompanied by a very strong anti-social behaviour strategy, there are considerable dangers in such an approach in a very large housing scheme where difficulties abound.There are two issues with affordable housing.  One is that it was affordable when the person or couple first got it but it may not be affordable now in the changed economic climate.  That should be closely monitored.  While I am sure we will continue to have affordable housing, it should be at a very practical level and affordable homes should not be in a very large local authority project —  I know there is a general move away from that.  It is interesting to note how housing provision waxes and wanes.  It moves from large schemes to smaller schemes and then back again to larger ones.  Based on my local knowledge the best kind of scheme is one of manageable size that will allow people, whether in social or affordable housing, to encompass one and other while also having some OPDs.  It is very useful for older people to live in a scheme where they see children going to and from school and see people going about their daily lives.  I never believed in enclaves of OPDs, which are like Florida at home, so to speak, and I do not think highly of them.  There should be a mixture, albeit a small-scale mixture.The Minister referred to anti-social behaviour in strong terms.  Joint policing committees have been established in urban and county areas.  I attended the initiation of one in County Westmeath.  Those bodies working through the local authorities will have a very positive effect on anti-social behaviour.  It is not good enough that people get a fine local authority house in a good urban neighbourhood and then proceed to play pup.  I would be all for being tolerant and I am noted for being very social minded, but I cannot see how people are able to give to free rein to their excesses in all sorts of ways and disrupt other people who wish to live their lives and rear their families in a fairly decent way.  Some good people are benighted by behaviour such as is carried out in many housing estates.This behaviour used to be just in one housing estate and people would refer to it as a bad estate.  It is now creeping.  I do not know if some of the blame can be placed at the door of the enormous wave of consumerism that hit us in the past five, six or seven years.  I do not think so.  Parents have children who need minding and caring regardless of their age.  Therefore the seeds of anti-social behaviour can be often based on lack of responsibility.  If people have a house, it is their house and it is up to them to mind it.  I would strongly encourage the local authorities, local Garda and local joint policing committees to develop a strong anti-social behaviour strategy.I understand the Minister of State will deal with homelessness in a series of amendments on Committee Stage, of which I greatly approve.  Homelessness is real and is not something we dream up.  One of the previous speakers spoke about people lying in porches and porticos of buildings throughout the city.  We all know there is homelessness.  Some people do not want to be helped and we need to come to grips with that.  There are people who, regardless of how much help is proffered to them, do not wish to avail of it.  That is their free will and they cannot be bludgeoned into taking whatever help is on offer.  Leaving that to one side, there is a real need to deal with genuine homeless people.  I know the Minister of State means well in his proposed amendments.Approaches can be made to the local housing officer, for example, in the town hall in Athlone suggesting that the council should consider purchasing a good house in a good terrace that is for sale with a view to giving it to somebody on the housing list.  We did a lot of that, particularly last year.  There is a fear this year that the finance will not be available for such houses.  However, I regard it as the very best way of dealing.  The market is down regardless of whether it is in Dublin, Donegal, Dingle or Athlone.  There is an opportunity, therefore, for local authorities to purchase decent homes in settled communities.  I know the Minister of State is battling manfully to retain finance for this area.  As the Bill shows, it is not always the provision of finance that is the defining matter for homelessness.  It is the provision of ideas and creativity as well as putting things on a proper footing and having a framework for housing.  All of that can be dealt with even in a time of stringent economic conditions.  It does not close down one's mind —  one's mind stays open and can see the big picture, which is reflected in the Bill.  However, I hope the provision of finance to purchase existing houses in decent neighbourhoods —  not necessarily posh neighbourhoods —  at affordable prices continues and that there is not a reduction in the provision of finance for such purchasing by the local authority.I strongly admire the women and men in local authority offices.  Obviously, I can speak only for those in my own county and town, who genuinely seek to meet the needs of those on their housing lists.  Housing lists are growing, which is why putting these schemes on a statutory footing and widening them to help people is very important.  Those officers deal with people sensitively and with great patience.  They also deal with us, elected representatives, with great patience as we continue to approach them on behalf of our constituents.Early in my political life I decided if one had a good education and had a chance of a good house, one had a chance to serve the people.  I remain very strongly of that mind as I deal with people every week on the provision of housing.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage and to listening to what people have to say.  I look forward to seeing the Opposition and Government amendments.  I know the Minister has already signalled his intention to introduce a raft of such amendments.  I look forward to being part of that process, but I hope the Bill does not go on forever.  While I hope anyone who wants to speak has a chance to do so, I would like to see the provisions coming into play.  I commend the actions of the Minister of State in dealing with this very important issue.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, a colleague from a neighbouring constituency.  I compliment him on his hands-on approach and on the work he has done in his portfolio since he took over as Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  He has performed extremely well, which is widely acknowledged throughout the country.  I always give credit where it is due.  I hope he keeps up the good work in the portfolio.The Minister of State has been good to his neighbouring counties.  I acknowledge his support for Granard recently in allocating funding for housing there.  County Longford needs more public housing, particularly in Longford town and Ballymahon, and I ask the Minister to allocate sufficient funds from his budget for additional housing in those two areas.  There are also areas of County Westmeath where funding for housing is needed.  I know when we approach the Minister of State, he will not be found wanting in supporting us and giving us the necessary funding for housing, which is badly needed.  Close to 600 people in the small county of Longford are on the waiting list for public housing.  There is huge demand and anything the Minister of State can do to alleviate the problems in our counties will be welcomed.Last July, in a scene that would not be out of place in a movie on gangland warfare, dozens of people armed with hatchets, iron bars, shovels, sticks and stones rioted in a housing estate in Mullingar, in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Petrol bombs were thrown and weapons of all types used, with a complete disregard for the safety of the residents of the area.  What deeply concerns me is that this breakdown in civil order took place during the school holidays, when young innocent children were playing in what should have been the safety of the open area of their own housing estate.To date, 55 people have been charged with offences relating to public disorder and have been remanded on bail to appear in court again in May in regard to this breakdown of the norms of society.  A number of men were charged under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act with possession of a variety of implements, including a golf club, a sword and a shovel.This case is by no means unique across the country and, in so far as it addresses such problems, the Bill is welcome.  Any measure that would allow decent law-abiding citizens to live in and enjoy the facilities of their home areas in peace and safety must certainly have the support of all sides of the House.Deputy O'Rourke referred to the joint policing committees which have been recently set up throughout the country under the local authorities.  They are a perfect example of co-operation between local authorities, Members of the Oireachtas and local Garda superintendents.  I had the pleasure of attending the inaugural meeting of the Longford committee last week.  Such a united effort to develop policy to bring law and order to our cities and towns is very welcome and should be a powerful force for change.The provision for the making of an anti-social behaviour strategy is the major strength of this legislation.  On the one hand, it could be said to be long overdue, and I am glad the Minister of State has taken this on board, given his responsibility for housing.  On the other hand, however, the escalation of violence on our housing estates to its current level was undoubtedly difficult to envisage.  It has now presented itself to us in its most outrageous manifestations and must be tackled before innocent lives are lost and built environments destroyed.  We have evidence of this in many parts of the country, in particular in many of our large towns, although it may not be evident in villages.The issue of graffiti that wantonly destroys the appearance of the built environment, despite the best efforts of residents to maintain the appearance of their estates, is one that must be urgently tackled.  In conjunction with efforts to enforce law and order, the initiative under restorative justice in which the offender must right the wrong is particularly applicable in this regard.  We want to see those who cause graffiti, anti-social behaviour and damage dealt with and it is important this has been addressed in the Bill.  If youths feel the need to deface property, it is important they be made clean it up.  We cannot have a softly, softly approach to this problem in any of our local authority areas.  When this legislation is passed, it is important the directors of services and senior officials within local authorities are brought in and asked to implement it to the last letter of the law.  It is fine having laws in place but the implementation of these laws is vital and will breathe life into housing estates.The issue of the tenant purchase scheme is now more important than ever.  The recent decline in the public housing stock, allied with high property prices, has played its part in lowering the number of tenant purchases.  The tenant purchase provision as outlined is disappointing in so far as it allows for a discount of only 30%.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this because it needs to be examined with greater attention.  The Minister of State might be open to an amendment on this issue as such a discount is way below that offered in the past.The sale of the century took place when the late John Boland was Minister for the Environment and it was a great success.  More people took control by buying out their houses under the tenant purchase scheme and there were fewer problems in housing estates.  It is important that we have a good social mix of tenants in such estates.It is no longer acceptable that people in voluntary housing schemes such as those linked to Respond, Clúid and Focus are precluded from purchasing their homes as this flies in the face of fairness and equality.  It is certainly a thin line of argument to refuse them this facility as these agencies are funded by the State and local authorities.  Can the Minister enlighten me as to why, and on what grounds, such purchases are disallowed?  Perhaps he will consider including them.  When people own their property, they have a greater sense of pride in that property and will maintain it to the letter of the law.  We all have a sense of pride in our homes and want them to look well, particularly when they are privately owned rather than in public ownership.In 2000, the Government launched a report entitled Homelessness —  an Integrated Strategy.  This report related to accommodation, health, welfare, education and preventative measures.  Of concern to us in regard to this Bill was the proposal in the report that local authorities were to be responsible for the provision of accommodation for the homeless, including emergency hostel accommodation, with the health boards, now the HSE, being responsible for in-house care and health needs.  Supposedly building on what was considered to be strong progress made under the integrated homeless strategy, The Way Home, which is described as a new strategy to address adult homelessness in Ireland between 2008 and 2013, was published last year.  The stated core objectives are to eliminate long-term occupation of emergency homeless facilities and the need to sleep rough —  which we see in plenty —  and to prevent the occurrence of homelessness as far as possible.  This should be the aim of all of us.There are currently more than 5,000 homeless people in Ireland.  Although the Bill encompasses measures that could be said to step outside the usual housing provision, it does not mention those people who lack basic living accommodation.  Housing, or shelter, is a basic human right and entitlement.  That this right is not mentioned, or considered as an option to be discussed in the Bill, is an insult to those among us who are forced to live in doorways and cardboard boxes, in a Third World manner.There is a man I pass every day who sleeps on doorsteps in Molesworth Street, across from this House, day in day out, rain, hail, snow or sunshine.  We might consider how different his circumstances are from those of tourists, or, of Members of the Oireachtas who book into the hotel across the road from where he sleeps.  Many of us stay in Buswell's or in other hotels close by and we see great numbers of homeless people.  This man is only one of those who sleep rough in doorways within 150 metres of this House.Life is relative.  It is not given to everyone to have a well-appointed house or, in some cases, two or three, but surely it is possible to give this man regular accommodation.  The Government does not appear to see him or others like him.  It must open its eyes to the issue of homelessness.  There is nowhere better to start than with this Bill and I ask the Minister of State to take this on board. I would appreciate if he were to do this.  He has shown a hands-on approach from the outset and therefore I have no doubt he will do so and that he will accept amendments from this side of the House concerning these issues.One report after another is published, each one supposedly building on the wonderful progress made by the proposals in the preceding one.  The process is repetitive.  MakeRoom, the campaign alliance of Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold Alliance have launched a campaign designed to highlight the scandalous omission of the issue of homelessness from this legislation.  They rightly ask the Minister to put homelessness at the heart of the Bill.  I am sure those agencies have corresponded with the Minister of State as well as with Members of the Opposition.I am shocked that a country which has placed such importance on housing since its inception should, in this Bill, ignore the most needy and vulnerable and fail to provide for them under its provisions. The omission by the current Government should be a cause of shame.  Perhaps the Minister of State might talk to his advisers about this.  Historically, the Free State Government made the first large-scale attempt to provide houses on a large scale under what was known as the "Million Pound Scheme".  Local authorities provided £225 million which was matched by £1 million in State aid for the provision of houses in each area.  Up to 2,000 houses were built under that scheme.  The Housing Acts of 1931 and 1932 were particularly significant, effecting slum clearance and giving greater assistance to local authorities for the housing of displaced families. Over 75 years later we are still trying to achieve equitable housing provision.The Celtic tiger years of 1995 onwards saw figures of those in employment rise from 1.1 million to 1.7 million.  Unemployment fell below 4%, effectively full employment, and housing demand and prices rose along with income levels and the greater participation in the work force by women.  This should be acknowledged.  I heard a discussion on "The Ryan Tubridy Show" today about the value of women in employment.  I very much support what was said in that programme.It is intolerable, after a decade of prosperity, that we still live in a society where homelessness is a part of life for so many and the valuable initiatives started in the opening years of the State have not led, despite the extremes of wealth reached in the intervening years, to basic housing provision for those unfortunate enough to be living on the streets.  It is vital that the root causes of homelessness such as poverty, drug and alcohol dependence be tackled but, more important, Bills such as this one must  recognise the problem and put in place measures to deal with it.  This cannot be emphasised often enough.  With the spectre of homelessness hanging over so many, as the Government takes the earnings of the low and middle income earners, leaving many of them unable to meet mortgage repayments, surely now more than ever is the time to face the issue of homelessness rather than bury it and refuse to deal with it.An associated issue is repossessions. When I spoke on the debate on the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Bill 2009, I highlighted the plight of frightened people throughout the country who have been made redundant and are now falling into mortgage arrears.  This situation is widespread.  I am sure that in his weekend clinics the Minister of State is, like myself, very much aware of this problem.  I call on the banks to work with home owners who find themselves in this unenviable situation.  The banks must take a more humane approach, forgetting repossession orders or legal proceedings in the short term, or until all other initiatives have been considered.  All Members should call on the banks to do this because this House has been very good to the banks.  We have pumped approximately €7 billion into them over the past few months and it is important that they should be considerate to their customers at this stage.While repossessions are not directly related to this Bill, it is important for us to consider their impact on social housing provision, with the potential increased demand for public and affordable housing.  I support this Bill but not in its totality.  How difficult can it be to stop skirting around the major issue of homelessness and tackle it head on? I know the Minister of State has the ability to do this and I shall keep an eye on his progress in this regard.  The first step must be to make good the omission at the heart of this legislation.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will consider the many amendments this side of the House will put forward.  He will doubtless put forward his own amendments to strengthen the legislation.  We have a golden opportunity at this time to bring in good law and we do not need to rush to legislation.  I appreciate that we are giving plenty of time to this important Bill over the coming days.I acknowledge the wonderful services provided by the staff of local authorities, especially housing staff around the country.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to those people in part of my constituency who work for Westmeath County Council.  I acknowledge the invaluable services given by officials in counties Westmeath and Longford.  I pay special tribute to a man the Minister of State knows very well in my own county, Mr. James Clark, who recently retired as director of services for housing with Longford County Council.  He was a model senior official and was very well thought of——

I welcome the Minister of State.The Bill has many beneficial features and will likely add value to the management of local authority housing and provide a governance framework for the delivery of housing services by local authorities.  However, there are some gaps in how the Bill will affect the delivery of housing services on the ground.  The most pressing one is that the Bill is in essence a local authority housing Bill and it overlooks the fact that currently, housing associations are responsible for providing between one quarter and one third of new social housing each year and there are now in the region of 20,000 units of social housing being managed by this sector.The sector, through the Irish Council for Social Housing, has identified that a strong legislative framework is now required to underpin the work of housing associations and it would be a shame if the opportunity to address that gap in this Bill was missed.  Voluntary housing associations are active in every county providing much-needed social housing and support services to some of the most vulnerable and deprived people.  The voluntary housing sector has a special role in providing much of the social housing for the elderly, people with disabilities and homeless people.  In addition, the impact of these schemes on local communities is immense, often ensuring smaller towns remain vibrant by providing community facilities on-site and by providing employment locally, for example, in the construction sector, in developing such new projects.Housing associations are involved in serving more than 400 communities throughout the country from larger urban areas to a small rural parish and the cumulative effect of their work extends well beyond the mere provision of social housing as they provide significant social capital to local communities.There are currently 718 approved housing bodies which have been granted approved status by the Minister under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002.  The Government's statement on housing policy, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, as part of its overall reform of social housing, states the intention on page 15 to, "improve governance of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector".  There are numerous powers for the Minister regarding governance of social housing delivered by local authorities.  However, the governance of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector has been overlooked.  It is still not clear from the Bill what is the proposed governance framework for approved housing bodies in this Bill.Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, is the relevant legislative power.  Does this provide sufficient powers to remove approved status?  Clearer instruments for the governance of approved housing bodies should be set out.  The powers dealing with approved status should be updated to reflect the size, scale and diversity of the sector with a need to update section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.The term "approved body" should be changed to "approved housing body" to distinguish from other approved bodies approved by other Departments, as it becomes confusing and the term "approved housing bodies", would provide greater clarity about the role and function of the organisation.The basis for housing association tenancies is still not clear.  In the Bill they are part of the social housing sector but in legislation the status of tenancies originates in the private rented sector.  However, they do not come under the auspices of the PRTB.  As the status of the approved bodies' tenancies is effectively unclear, the Bill should include powers to allow for approved housing bodies access by regulation, if required, to relevant parts of the PRTB Act or relevant housing legislation.I am currently a board member of The Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, which is the national federation of housing associations in Ireland.  The ICSH has more than 300 affiliated member housing associations providing accommodation for families, single people, the elderly, homeless people and people with disabilities.  Housing associations which in legislation are referred to as "approved housing bodies", are non-profit organisations formed for the purpose of relieving housing need and the provision and management of housing.  They are established by a voluntary management board to benefit the community in which they are based.  Approved non-profit housing bodies, housing associations and housing co-operatives, currently manage in excess of 20,000 dwellings.  In 2007 housing associations developed 1,685 units of accommodation and are estimated to have provided a similar or greater number in 2008, especially with the additional capital funding which the Minister obtained to meet commitments for Part V projects which was very much welcomed in the sector. Projects undertaken by housing associations may be in response to the needs of the elderly, people with disabilities, homeless persons or families and single people on low incomes.  Some housing associations may be formed to specialise in meeting a particular housing need while others develop with broader aims.The specific housing services offered will depend on the aims or concerns of the members, the needs of tenants as well as the financial and other resources available for both capital costs and ongoing management running costs.  Depending on the type of housing need to be met by the housing association, the accommodation provided may be in the form of ordinary rental houses or flats or specially designed supportive sheltered housing with on-site communal welfare facilities, group homes or hostels.  It is a very broad range.Along with the ICSH, I welcome the publication of the Bill and consider it a wide-ranging piece of legislation.  I recognise that it seeks to add clarity to many aspects of the provision of social housing.  I note that improvements in the legislative framework for the reform of social housing have been sought for some time and I recognise this Bill is a step towards providing greater legal clarity.  The reform measures outlined in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, are reflected in the Bill to some degree but require strengthening.  While welcoming in general the publication of the Bill there are a number of aspects to which I seek to draw attention and which will need to be addressed.  These aspects include significant areas of reform which are required but have not been included in the Bill's provisions.The Bill as it stands requires amendment.  I welcome the strengthening of the role of elected members in adopting the proposed local authority housing services plan.  However, it would be useful if the same level of consultation were in place for the local authority housing action programme.  This would be essential in allowing elected members to be able to measure progress of the implementation of the targets in the housing action programme which is often part of local authorities' housing-related strategic policy committee role.It would also be essential to have consultation with the voluntary housing sector in adopting the local authority housing action programme.  In many local authority areas, housing associations in the voluntary housing sector play an increasing role in delivering commitments and targets in the housing action programme.  It is only logical that the organisations being asked to deliver would have a meaningful input. I know from my own experience with the voluntary housing sector that one of the greatest frustrations is not knowing or being denied information about the former housing action plans on social housing targets in different areas.  It is very frustrating.  In addition, the new guidelines for voluntary housing associations developing new housing projects require preliminary and detailed appraisals to be undertaken before any project can proceed and as part of this process the housing association has to show that the proposed project is in line with the commitments in the housing action plan.  This will be impossible if the information in the housing action plan or programme is not forthcoming.If the voluntary housing sector is being asked to work in partnership with local authorities then access to information in the housing action programme is crucial.  The more comprehensive approach in the Bill to the future housing needs assessment process undertaken by local authorities is to be welcomed.I ask the Minister of State to arrange for more regular or real time assessment of housing need as every three years in the current climate does not allow for up to date planning.  I know from my own area in south Tipperary and west Waterford there has been an increase in the demand for social housing since the last assessment in March 2008.  I ask the Minister of State that the Bill would allow for an annual assessment in this current climate.Previously, there has been a greater emphasis on the physical aspects of social housing support.  Even with special needs groups, this has focused on the very important grants for older people and those with disabilities.  However, the Bill should contain a direction to local authorities to the effect that social housing also focuses on aspects such as onsite supports as well as sheltered and supported housing.The provisions on anti-social behaviour are welcome in terms of providing reassurance for the vast majority of good tenants.  A strengthened Bill will achieve a better outcome and greater clarity for the Minister of State's Department, local authorities and the voluntary housing sector as well as, importantly, for tenants and the public.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I welcome this Bill and believe it creates a very important roadmap for housing policy and the Government's schemes in this area for the coming years.As the Minister of State said this afternoon, it is very important that despite the financial challenges being faced by the Government, we have a strong sense of where we are going with housing.  The right to housing and the strong sense of entitlement to it in this country are enormously important for people and Government policy must adapt and change with new trends and in new economic times.The regulatory impact assessment prepared for this Bill had very strong aims and principles such as the need to focus on the long-term housing needs of people, not just in the short term, as well as the need for greater social mix in estates through the geographical dispersal of social housing and the need to improve co-ordination of housing activities by strengthening the role of housing authorities in housing provision, along with support services generally.  This last aim is very important if we are to get local authorities to ensure greater planning of housing needs within county development plans.I warmly welcome the provision in the Bill to oblige local authorities to make a housing services plan within six months of a development being planned.  Let us have no drift with regard to that time limit because it is so important to have housing copper-fastened in the county development plan.  Equally important is the requirement on the county manager to ensure the plan's implementation.Another important aspect of the legislation is the section dealing with measures to address anti-social behaviour.  Other Members of the House have addressed this but I am aware from the experience of my constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny of the terror that overtakes those living in areas where hooliganism can be threatening, abusive, extremely noisy and can turn peaceful estates into nightmarish areas.  I am not only referring to a few eggs being thrown at a window but rather joy-riding on green spaces, trees being cut down, galloping horses on greens and even the discharge of firearms, as in County Carlow recently, and the ever-prevalent scourge of drug dealing.  There are probably other aspects of anti-social behaviour of which we are all aware but if we could eradicate and make it more difficult for this type of behaviour to be indulged in on estates, it would make for much more peaceful communities.The redefinition of what constitutes anti-social behaviour and the protection given to the operation of social and affordable housing from unrealistic demands emanating from those who are anti-social is important.  Chapter 4 of the Bill, with its provisions for the rental accommodation scheme, is extremely detailed.  These new powers for housing authorities will improve the standard of housing accommodation available for those renting through councils.  One important aspect of the new provisions in this chapter is the facility for local authorities to inspect the dwellings being rented from private landlords by those on social housing.  We have all had complaint after complaint where rented accommodation is sometimes abused by the landlord, who does not maintain it properly, or indeed by the tenants who avail of private rented accommodation.  Where such inspection is not possible by local authorities, the danger of exploitation is significant.  This provision in this part of the Bill means a local authority can work with a tenant to ensure that the scheme is being respected by landlords.The provision in Part 3 for a new incremental purchasing scheme is to be welcomed as a sign of further empowerment of those in need of social or affordable housing to move towards full housing independence.  I believe Deputy Bannon raised the matter of the need for people to buy out the Respond houses.  The jury is out in that regard because if the housing stock is all sold off the local authority will be in a parlous position in not being able to provide rented accommodation in times of need.Looking forward, the implications of negative equity must be factored into all provisions of the Bill, and to a considerable extent they are.  However, I hope the Minster of State ensures that the considerably changed housing market, even from the time this Bill was published, must be considered in all purchasing schemes.  I should also like to see the Minister of State explore the possibility of allowing tenants the right to purchase local authority apartments, something that is currently prohibited.  This would be a very welcome step forward in adding provision and security of housing for tenants.  Why should they not be able to buy local authority apartments?  It makes sense in these tough economic times in terms of smaller housing units, built in nice areas and well maintained.  I hope the Minister looks at this proposal sympathetically.An aspect of social housing which is perhaps beyond the scope of this Bill is important in terms of developments in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It concerns the roll-out of retrofit schemes for social housing.  Socially, environmentally and economically the sooner the retrofit scheme is implemented, the better.  I have one last plea, which might not be in the remit of the Minister of State.  I was in a local authority estate recently where one could not kick a ball on the miserly little green space catering for about 30 houses, while next door one could fit a couple of stadiums the size of Croke Parks and which was beautifully landscaped with lovely trees.  We should put a good deal of effort into our social housing units, to ensure there are nice places for mothers to sit out with their children in buggies, for children to play or for older tenants to be able to enjoy a peaceful part of their housing development.  That should be factored in.  In very tough economic times we must ensure that the provision of housing and the aspect on which dwellings look out helps people enjoy where they are living.  That aspect should be addressed in the Bill.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I welcome this Bill.  When we consider the number of housing-related Bills we have had over the last three or four decades we might expect that the end product would update the many shortfalls exposed in a practical manner as a result of this Bill.  Unfortunately I cannot see much improvement in many areas, welcome though many of the Bill's provisions are.Given that the Minister of State is a rural Deputy, I am astonished that there is not one mention of rural housing in the Bill.  We have concentrated on the problems and difficulties we have in urban and city locations, and these are many, but there is not a single reference to the provision of rural housing.  The difficulty with that, as the Minister of State knows, is that people from rural families on housing lists must, in the main, return to an urban environment to be housed.  People from rural communities going into urban situations can cause problems, and they encounter difficulties when they move there.With regard to the cost factor, very often somebody from a rural background in need of housing may have a site available.  This normally might be made available for a nominal amount and provide very competitive prices, albeit for once-off housing development.  There is a lack of competitiveness in terms of price per unit for a rural house in a once-off housing development as against those in large estates.We have a Green Party Minister with overall responsibility for the environment but I have not seen anywhere in the Bill, and I am open to correction on this, any emphasis on a new response in terms of the need for greener energy measures, either through design or density.  There is no facility to highlight the green agenda.  Is it not important to have some indication that there could be a diversification away from the standard house design to include solar panels, the need for very high standards of insulation, communal heating systems and so on?  There was an opportunity to modernise the Bill in that area but, unfortunately, it is lacking in that regard.I refer to the question of design.  The Minister of State may have been a member of a local authority when a former Member, Bobby Molloy, as Minister with responsibility for the environment, allowed for the construction of large estates and the houses did not have chimneys.  Where those houses still exist they are a monument to his Ministry.That would be funny if it were not for the fact that we continue to design and construct houses that do not have a back door.  I visited an estate recently and a tenant told me that they had to bring their fuel through the hall door, down a narrow hallway, out through the kitchen and into the back garden.  There is a responsibility to have standards in design.  That area must be monitored but it appears there is no monitoring of any kind in terms of design standards.  Is it a case of wanting to put as many houses as possible into those areas and doing them as cheaply as possible?  That creates serious problems for the future because even the most careful tenants in many of those houses find that certain furniture fittings, the heating, flooring, insulation or whatever are inadequate and immediately seek to have repairs done, which results in additional expenditure on those houses.  That should not be necessary if proper standards were adhered to.I do not know whether it is the responsibility of local authorities to appoint architects and design teams for large housing estates or if this is done centrally but most people would say that when they go into a large housing estate and see a repetition of the same design, standards, elevations and so on, it lacks a community element from the outset.  There is nothing that would encourage even the most enthusiastic community minded people to want to belong to that community and be proud to live in it.  It would be irresponsible to suggest that a young couple or family in need that gets a house from a local authority are not delighted with it but when the other difficulties to which I referred arise, the community spirit that should be engendered is not there.It is penny pinching in the extreme that local authorities are not provided with the funding to appoint liaison officers who would liaise between council housing sections and the tenants in the various authorities.  They do not have to be available day and night but if there was a presence, even on a periodic basis, they could knock on the tenants' doors and ask if there is anything they want or if they can follow up on anything for them.  There is a breakdown in that regard.  There is no point in presenting a key to a new tenant, letting them close the door and the council walking away and saying they are finished with them and that is another one off the list.  That is not good enough.  The Minister of State said he does not have the funding to provide for what I would call liaison officers to represent the local authority housing section but if they were appointed it would at least eliminate the many difficulties that may arise in the future.There have been approximately 12 or 14 housing Bills over the years.  New phenomena arise all the time and the one that was raised by numerous speakers is the question of anti-social behaviour.  We cannot blame the housing authority personnel, the director of housing and the housing officers, for this.  Like many previous speakers I want to pay a special tribute to the housing section of Galway County Council under its director and officers for the excellent way in which they deliver the resources and the housing within the county and rural areas in County Galway.  Traditionally, they have been exemplary.  I am sure Members representing other counties would say the same about their areas but for a large county like Galway, and the great number of houses it provides for many families throughout the county, Galway County Council must be complimented.Having said that, many difficulties present themselves to those people and some of them are dealt with in the Bill.  Section 62 of the 1966 Bill must be amended as a matter of urgency and incorporated in this Bill and I will outline my reason for saying that.  There is a frustration on the part of directors of services in housing throughout the country because of the inadequacies of their powers to go into court in cases where there is identifiable anti-social behaviour.  The tenants responsible for that anti-social behaviour cannot be taken to task quickly and evicted from their housing because when the council goes to court there is such a proliferation of laws that somebody will bring up one of them in court.It is equally important that there are support services available for tenants who are experiencing difficulties.  I am not suggesting we eliminate those but where there is identifiable and blatant anti-social behaviour, the hands of the housing directors and those responsible within local authorities are tied because they cannot move quickly enough with the current systems to evict those people.We are talking about local authority housing but I want to refer to the private rental scheme where the Health Service Executive is providing rent allowance on an ongoing basis to people who are behaving in an anti-social manner.  Private landlords are also hampered in the way they can deal with the problem.  The best way the problem could be dealt with is by withdrawing the rent supplement but that does not happen.  I accept it is a drastic step but drastic circumstances require such measures.  There is an urgent need to give the necessary powers to the local authorities and involve all the agencies involved.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned the joint policing services earlier and the important role they have played, particularly in small towns, with regard to co-operating with local authorities to eliminate some of the difficulties that arise.Another provision in the Bill which struck me is the section which refers to a timeframe within which the matter has to be dealt.  Initially it is eight weeks, then four weeks and some other number of weeks before, at last, the final report is available to the Minister.  The important thing is there is no indication, as far as I can see from the conditions here, where there is an onus on the local authority or Department to highlight and advertise the conditions in this Bill.I do not know if the consultation period and facilities to bring groups together are adequate or what ideas the Minister has for the future to highlight existing estates and future developments, or where councils intend to build or provide housing.  Therein lies a major difficulty.  I checked in my local authority as to the landbank available to the council.  Unfortunately, the landbank has been eliminated.  That is not to say there is inadequate housing for the many people on a waiting list.There was a time when local authorities had landbanks.  There were difficulties and one could retort by arguing that if a local authority had a large stretch of land it would create a ghetto.  That is not what I mean and it does not have to be the case.  With proper design, density requirements and provision of facilities integrated into such developments we could have very solid communities from social housing.  The spread of such houses, within the conditions of this Bill, is very welcome, whether it is affordable housing, other rented accommodation or the eventual purchase of houses.  The Minister of State may be able to address the matter of landbanks in a future reply.I remind the Minister of State that local authorities, the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have never been presented with such a golden opportunity.  Throughout the country there is an oversupply of houses, which are wonderful, constructed to the highest standards and available at good prices.  There is a hesitancy on the part of councils to buy those houses.  It is important to note that these estates, in the main, are already completed and landscaped, and have in place all the required services, which we would not normally associate with council houses for a long period of time after tenants have moved in.There always have been difficulties in parts of the country where there has been a shortfall in resources and money for the provision of basic services such as lighting, open spaces and playgrounds.  If the Minister of State lets this opportunity go without including these factors it will be remiss of him.On the issue of the timescale, I emphasise to the Minister the importance of having open consultation with all interested groups, other agencies such as the HSE and the Garda Síochána and housing and community groups throughout the country, who are all willing to participate.  Many people say public meetings will be held and there will be horrific statements about various groups.  That is not what I have in mind.  If a proper presentation is delivered and a explanation is given of what is involved in this Bill, the questions and difficulties which now exist could be very easily and readily eliminated.I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the timeframes he mentioned for the plans he has devised.  A time of four weeks to describe housing circumstances in writing and a period of six months is mentioned for another situation.I wish to raise the issue of the 1966 Act.  The Minister of State should make it clear that when directors of housing in local authorities have to go to court, they can do so and adequately make the case regarding a person brought before the court on a matter of anti-social behaviour, and that the person will be dealt with adequately, sufficiently and fairly.One section of the Bill concerns the provision of caravan sites.  They have led to very serious problems and difficulties and have given local authorities and officials a very bad name when halting sites are provided with no services.  There may be running water but it is cold.  There are no washing facilities, communal or otherwise.  When a Minister allows that we are asking for trouble.  Difficulties have arisen in many areas.  The Traveller community will be discontented when there is a failure to provide adequate or reasonable facilities.  We commit a very serious error by not providing adequate facilities.If the Minister of State proposes to allow local authorities to provide such facilities in the future, no tenant, no matter what the urgency, should be allowed into a site until adequate facilities are in place and there is constant monitoring by a liaison officer.  If funding is not provided for this more problems will be generated down the line.

I welcome the publication of this Bill and believe, when passed, it will improve the quality of housing services provided by local authorities.  However, with constructive amendments, we can make a positive impact to end long-term homelessness.  In particular, I would like to see the provisions outlined in the Government's programme on the homeless strategy, The Way Home, included in the Bill.  Placing the issue of long-term homelessness on a statutory footing will ensure all local authorities and statutory agencies will have to meet their commitments.I would like provisions on the right to housing for those in need, a new legal definition of homelessness and a greater level of standardisation in housing needs assessment and local authority allocation schemes included in the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to put the issue of homelessness at the heart of this Bill.The standards and quality of local authority housing have improved enormously.  It is now difficult to identify whether a scheme has been built by a local authority or a private company.  Unfortunately, there are people involved in anti-social behaviour in some local authority housing schemes.  It is imperative that all of us, particularly those in local authorities, ensure people involved in such behaviour are eliminated from the communities and not allowed to destroy an entire estate or community.  Everything must be done in accordance with the law.  The new policing boards will have an important role to play and they should have an input into the assessment of the suitability of people for local authority housing.

Between February 2008 and February 2009, the live register increased by approximately 165,000 people or more than 87%.  Staff in social welfare local offices are working extremely hard and productivity increased by 74% between the last quarter of 2007 and the final quarter of 2008.  Approximately 250 additional posts have been allocated by the Department in recent months.  A total of 190 additional staff are also being put in place in local offices to minimise delays in claim processing.These include 31 additional staff assigned to local offices; 115 additional staff identified as necessary as part of a staffing review carried out in October 2008; 32 temporary staff assigned from 2 March to the 17 local offices with the highest volumes of claims on hand; and 12 extra staff as identified in a separate staffing exercise for Cork local office.  As many local offices are close to capacity in accommodating more staff, a further 40 staff are being assigned to central decisions units.  A total of 16 social welfare inspectors are also being assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseeker's allowance.  In addition to these 250 staff, the number of facilitators has also been increased from 40 to 60.Measures have also been taken to improve the processes used in processing claims. These include the introduction of a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years; the testing of an improved procedure for claimants moving from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance, which we plan to extend to all offices later this month; on-line availability of application forms for the jobseeker schemes; and the use of an appointment system for taking claims in some offices which we intend to roll out to other areas over the coming months.  While every effort is made to ensure applications are processed as quickly as possible, those who are under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker's payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions but which means nobody need go without.I fully appreciate that becoming unemployed and having to claim a jobseeker's payment is stressful enough.  By introducing these initiatives I am trying to ensure the process is as easy as it can be.  Processing times in some areas are still too long and I assure Deputies that the necessary steps are being taken to reduce them.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I welcome any steps taken to reduce the processing time but I am concerned about the pace of delivery of the changes.  The Minister stated claimants could avail of the supplementary welfare allowance but the difficulty is that part of the service has gone beyond breaking point, according to some staff.  The knock-on effect of not having sufficient staff in local welfare offices means claimants are forwarded to community welfare officers, CWOs, who are inundated.  The number of claims they process has increased by 85% over the past two years.What is the average delay at this time?  Has it improved since we last discussed the issue in February?  Perhaps the times have improved in some offices but I am sure they have deteriorated in others.  The Minister issued a statement outlining the additional need for staff in her Department and said the matter had been raised with the Department of Finance.  What was the Department's response?  Will additional staff be provided?The Minister stated between 40 and 60 facilitators had been approved.  Last July, she announced 50 additional facilitators would be taken on.  Were all of them recruited?Before community welfare officers make a payment to a claimant, they carry out an assessment to ensure the person is entitled to the allowance he or she is seeking from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  They can process that within a week before making the payment.  How can a CWO, given his or her workload, do that while the Department's officials take up to 16 weeks to process claims in some instances?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	143	CWOs come under the HSE, even though they use money from my Department's budget.  I appreciate that they are under a great deal of pressure but the HSE has put together a business case for additional officers that must be considered in the context of overall numbers in the public service.  To date, we have not had a difficulty with the Department of Finance in seeking additional staff primarily because the officials are being transferred from other Departments.  However, different arrangements and agreements were put in place over the years regarding panels, regions and so on, which must be adhered to, and that can affect the movement of officials.  The fact that we have sanction to move almost 250 officials demonstrates the co-operation between the Department and the Minister for Finance.The average processing time for the jobseeker's benefit is shorter than that for the jobseeker's allowance because a means test is required.  It is approximately two weeks for benefit claims and five weeks for the allowance claim.  The volume of applications in January and February will push the processing time back.  Unfortunately, 1,000 people a day signed on the live register in January, which could result in many more jobseeker's allowance claims, while 26,500 signed on in February, which is significant.  Every effort is being made.Queues, unfortunately, form outside social welfare offices and staff have asked claimants to return in the afternoon when fewer people tend to sign on.  I can understand that somebody who is used to getting up and heading to work wants to get into the social welfare office and sort out his or her affairs as quickly as possible.  Claimants tend to turn up first thing in the morning.  The staff in the offices have been trying to manage as best they can to facilitate people at different times.

I will ask the questions again that I asked earlier.  What happened to the 50 facilitators, the appointment of whom the Minister announced last July?  Were they all recruited and deployed?  When did the number of facilitators change from 40 to 60?  When community welfare officers assess an application for a supplementary welfare payment, they must obtain information to ensure the claimant has an entitlement.  How can they process such claims within a week while it takes up to 16 weeks for the Department to process claims?

More facilitators will be provided under the national development plan, NDP.  I am open to correction but the number has increased by 20 since July.  Under the NDP, 50 additional facilitators were to be deployed.  They are facilitating the back to education and back to work schemes.The difference in the assessments conducted by the community welfare officer and local welfare office staff is that the CWOs assess for an immediate need whereas the local office staff assess for a long-term need.  The assessment must, therefore, be thorough.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The security of occupational pension schemes is of paramount importance to the Government.  Trust law, under which most pension schemes are established, ensures that the assets of the scheme are legally separate from the assets of the employer and are not available to other creditors should an employer become insolvent.  Trustees of occupational pension schemes have responsibility for ensuring that the entitlements of scheme members are adequately protected and that they receive the pensions due to them.  In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 provides for the regulation of pensions schemes in Ireland.  Under this Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard, which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard, the sponsors-trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore the scheme to full funding.It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefits pension schemes are in deficit.  However, the full extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.   This Government has sought to ensure, in so far as it can, that sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take. Indeed, we recently implemented a number of short-term measures to ease the pressures including additional time for schemes to formulate funding proposals; greater flexibility —  more than ten years —  for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances; allowing a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan; and enabling the board to take into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans.Furthermore, to ensure these concessions are not seen as a weakening of supervision arrangements, the Pensions Board will not accept recovery plans which do not demonstrate an appropriate investment approach.  The Government is considering a number of options regarding the ongoing security of occupational pensions.  Decisions made in this context will be considered as part of the development of the national pensions framework, which is due to be finalised shortly.

We are now paying the price in so far as no policy is in place and no action has been taken in recent years.Some 500,000 people depend on defined benefit pension schemes, the majority of which are underfunded.  This is the Minister's responsibility.  The Green Paper on Pensions was published 18 months ago, but we still do not know her thoughts on it.  What is the extent of the overall shortfall in funding in defined benefit schemes, what actions does she propose to take and how will she avoid exposing the State to substantial claims over defined benefit schemes in insolvent companies, for example, Waterford Crystal?  Its workers made a proposal to deal with the pensions shortfall, but she rejected it and has consequently exposed the State to serious claims arising from the Robbins judgment in the European Court of Justice.

I can understand people's concerns about their pension schemes.  Pensions are well regulated under trust law and the Pensions Acts, but there is scope for a tightening of regulation as has occurred in other areas, such as in the financial arena where regulation was not as tight as necessary.Defined benefit schemes are private investment funds.  While it is difficult for people to watch the funds into which they have been contributing running into difficulty, the Government's first commitment is to the State pension.  It must be remembered that the schemes in question are private schemes.  However, the Government is considering a number of proposals and issues.The European Commission is conducting an assessment of the impact of the ruling in the Robbins case.  At the time, it was satisfied that Ireland was in compliance with all of the then regulations.

Currently, almost 80,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 34% since the end of December 2007.Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation.  Maximum rent limits are prescribed in regulations and are time limited so that they can be adjusted in light of rent levels generally.  The most recent regulations cover the period up to 31 December 2009.Rent limits are currently being reviewed.  In testing the level at which basic accommodation can be secured, the Department is informed by analysis of data on rent supplement tenancies, data provided by the Private Residential Tenancies Board on tenancies registered by it and submissions by interested statutory and non-statutory bodies, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The review will also be informed by the latest private rented index report to be published by the CSO in mid-March 2009.The Government has recently approved a package of measures to update minimum standards regulations for rental accommodation.  Enforcement of these standards is the responsibility of local authorities.  Accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  Where a housing authority notifies the HSE of non-compliance with housing standards, rent supplement is not payable.  Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation that appears to be substandard it notifies the local authority of its concerns.  The HSE may also advise prospective tenants that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of tenancies at the premises.The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which is operated by local authorities, provides access to a range of long-term, good quality housing supports for those availing of it.  Details of people in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or longer are notified to the local authorities through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for inclusion in the schemes.  This data is also used by local authorities in enforcing housing standards.  Currently, 31,000 people are getting rent supplement for 18 months or longer and almost 18,000 tenants have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the RAS since 2005.  The Department is committed to supporting local authorities in meeting their responsibilities in the enforcement of housing standards and the implementation of the RAS.

Is the Minister concerned that her Department has not come close to meeting its targets regarding the transfer of people from rent supplement to the RAS?  The transfer rate is nowhere near what was expected.  How does she intend to address this and when does she expect the aforementioned 31,000 recipients of rent supplement to move on to the RAS?  When does she expect to reach that target figure?The Minister is probably aware of a survey conducted by Threshold that she should take into consideration during her review.  Of 172 bedsit accommodation units examined by Threshold in the Dublin area, only three were available that complied with the new regulations and accepted rent supplement.  A serious problem exists at the lower level of the market regarding the amount being paid to people and the quality of the accommodation.  How does the Minister intend to address this issue?  While I believe there is a need for a review of rent limits, I wish to ensure that those at the lower end of the market will be protected in that review.

The CSO survey guides the Department most and is due out in the middle of this month.  It will feed into the rent limit review being undertaken by my Department.  It is significant that 21,000 units are available for rent in Dublin at present, whereas only 10,000 units were available one year ago.  Consequently, this should affect rent prices, as well as the availability of good quality accommodation.

I ask again, why not?  Second, in the course of the rent limit review, has the Minister considered setting up a deposit protection scheme?  Her Department is unable to get back between €6 million and €7 million a year that is paid to landlords when deposits are forfeited.  Were a scheme put in place whereby those deposits were protected, it would be a saving to the Department.  Has the Minister examined this issue and does she intend to do anything about it?

However, I am happy to answer it again.  The provision of social housing and responsibility for the RAS rests with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with which we are working very closely to ensure that those who are on rent supplement can transfer.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	185	As for the quality of accommodation, again this is the responsibility of that Department and new regulations came in force on 1 February.  They apply to new premises immediately and allow a four-year phasing-in time for other premises, which should help to improve the quality.  As I mentioned, the availability of additional places, some of which are new, should ensure that people are able to get better quality.  At present, the Department does not operate a deposit return scheme.  However, it is something we can examine to ascertain whether it would be a viable option.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, is the main Government-funded service that provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS national telephone helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, at lo-call number 1890 283 438, and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.In 2008, more than 16,600 new clients approached the MABS for assistance with debt difficulties and the telephone helpline dealt with almost 11,000 callers.  This year, 3,400 new clients have approached the service.  The telephone helpline has received 4,200 calls up to the end of February.  In 2009, almost €18 million has been provided to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.  Six additional full and part-time staff have been allocated to the local services.  The capacity of the telephone helpline has been strengthened and MABSndl, the national support company, has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the local services in managing their increased caseloads.There now are 252 money advice staff employed throughout the country in the MABS.  Money advisers help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.  All MABS companies operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and are dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the telephone helpline and to the MABS website.  More than 90% of callers to the helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline adviser.  Approximately 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for appointment.The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should take early action.  An approach to the MABS, via any of the channels, can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties.  The MABS provides a high-quality, personal service to members of the public that helps many in coping with and overcoming the burden of indebtedness that can have such an impact on their lives and that of their families.

The MABS does very good work and is to be commended, particularly given the difficult environment in which it now operates.  That said, there is a need for a new or different level of expertise within the MABS organisation.  Will the Minister give consideration to the idea of allowing the MABS to employ people with expertise in dealing with financial institutions to discuss the issue of loans and possible repossessions?  This is a matter that has been brought to my attention repeatedly recently.  I encountered an example this morning of someone over whom the threat of repossession hangs but who will be obliged to wait for eight weeks before being able to make an appointment with the MABS because the latter is so busy at present.  There is a real need to have a division of MABS that can negotiate with financial institutions because agreements can be reached that would help people.  However, the organisational capacity is not necessarily there, certainly not nationwide, to be able to so do for people at present.  While the Minister cannot necessarily agree to this today, has she given consideration to this possibility or has she been approached to examine this issue?In a related topic, the Minister probably is aware that people who avail of the moratorium on their mortgage repayments will have their credit rating damaged as a result, despite the Government's announcement.  Has the Minister considered examining this issue to ensure that people's credit rating will not be damaged as a result?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I am unsure what the Deputy is asking in her first question.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	189	To explain, my proposal is to have people in the MABS who have the time and the expertise to negotiate with financial institutions on people's behalf.  They would negotiate changes in people's mortgage repayments and effectively would prevent repossessions.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	190	That is what the money advisers do at present.  I am aware the Deputy had a meeting recently to deal with her interests and concerns in this regard but in any company I have visited, the money advisers contact all the different creditors.  One problem they are encountering is that those who are approaching them have up to 23 different creditors.  In the past, when they dealt with a person who was dependent on social welfare, the problem may simply have been with the utilities, whereas at present, the MABS is finding the problems pertain to the utilities, financial institutions' moneylenders and a range of others.  Consequently, each individual person who comes in is taking a considerable amount of time and the MABS is quite extended.  However, those money advisers, having met the individual concerned, start negotiating with the banks.  Recently the banks have signed up in respect of repossessions of homes and a timescale that would be used in that regard.  Moreover, the statutory code of conduct that was introduced last week has meant that when people run into difficulty with financing institutions, they must be referred to MABS for advice.  That is the role of the money advisers.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I am not criticising the work MABS is doing.  However, dealing with financial institutions, particularly in the sub-prime area, requires different skills to those involved in contacting the ESB or Bord Gáis.  The latter and organisations like them take a fairly responsible approach to those who are in debt.  I am of the view, having talked to many people about this, that there is a need for an increase in the capacity of MABS to negotiate with sub-prime institutions.  Will the Minister examine this?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	192	More than 3,000 new clients have presented to MABS in the first two months of the year.  It is under great pressure but is responding well to the demands on its resources.  I will certainly investigate the issue the Deputy has raised and am willing to discuss it in more detail with her.  The sub-prime lenders are a serious concern.  MABS money advisers are finding it extremely difficult to get sub-prime lenders to work with them.  The main financial institutions are certainly willing to do so and are now signed up to the code of conduct in this regard.  Sub-prime lenders persuaded clients to consolidate all their loans into their mortgage.  For example, a person with an initial mortgage of €40,000 may have ended up with a loan of €150,000 or €180,000 following the consolidation of all types of other debts.  As I said, MABS money advisers are finding it difficult to get sub-prime lenders to engage with clients in difficulty.  That is one of the issues we are trying to address.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the back to education allowance scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full-time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so.  The allowance replaces the applicant's existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  Also, participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled.In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for six months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The scheme has been modified in recent times.  In order to support activation of unemployed people, the qualifying period for the third level option is reduced to nine months for persons participating in the national employment action plan process.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.The Government has devoted significant resources to the back to education allowance, with €519 million allocated over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  This year, the budget for the scheme is €87.8 million and the number of participants has increased again in the current academic year.  The number participating in the scheme at the end of January 2009 was 11,534, an increase of 46% compared with the end of January 2008.The back to education allowance is an important part of our overall strategy to provide opportunities for unemployed people to upskill in order to enhance their prospects of entering or returning to the labour force.  The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need them most.  The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Just because a scheme operated in a particular way in the past does not mean it should continue to operate in the same way in these changed economic times.  The Minister said that €519 million is allocated to the scheme during the lifetime of the national development plan.  If people are denied access to the back to education allowance, they will continue to be in receipt of other social welfare payments.  The Minister seems unable to grasp this point.The Taoiseach made reference to the back to education allowance in his speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis last weekend but provided no context to his comment.  Are changes proposed to the scheme and, if so, what specific changes are being examined?  As the Minister observed, the regulations are less strict for those in receipt of statutory redundancy.  This does not seem equitable.  Of the increasing numbers of people who find themselves unemployed when the shop, hotel or restaurant in which they worked  closes, many do not receive statutory redundancy.  Why should they be penalised further by being denied the back to education allowance which is available immediately to persons who receive a lump sum on redundancy?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The context of the Taoiseach's speech and the speeches I and others made at the Ard-Fheis was to ascertain how, through co-operation between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we can make best use of the various existing schemes in order to facilitate as many people as possible to avail of training and education.  My Department is actively seeking to ensure the schemes we administer are put to best effect in meeting the needs of those who avail of them.  This will mean availing of vacancies in the post-leaving certificate sector and any spare capacity in the institutes of technology, as well as correlating our activities with those of FÁS.As I said, we are actively looking to see what changes are required in the existing schemes to best meet the needs of those who find themselves unemployed.  At the same time —  and I know the Deputy agrees me with on this because we have discussed it before in the House —  we must ensure we do not find ourselves in a situation where people are organising their affairs in order to avail of the back to education allowance, particularly in respect of third level courses.  Nevertheless, there is scope to facilitate as many as possible.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	196	It is a legitimate concern that people should not be encouraged to organise their affairs in that manner.  However, I do not want people sitting idle for as long as 23 months.  For example, if one loses one's job in October, one will be ineligible for the back to education allowance when the new college year starts 11 months later.  Therefore, one must wait another entire year, until the following September, to avail of the scheme.  This is of no assistance to people.The Minister said she is examining this entire area.  When does she propose to provide a solution to these difficulties?  She should begin making changes immediately.  We are always saying that emerging technologies will be what helps to bring us out of this recession.  This would be somewhere to start.  Members meet unemployed people every day who want to use their situation as an opportunity to retrain rather than merely sit at home hoping to find some type of work somewhere.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Many of the courses that are of particular benefit in terms of upskilling and retraining are at post-leaving certificate level, which is considered to be second level.  Therefore, the less strict time requirements are applicable in those cases.  For participants in the national employment action plan, the time requirement in respect of third level courses is reduced from 12 to nine months.

I understand the current figure is some 60,000.  The institutes of technology in particular are trying to organise their courses in such a way that applicants will not have to wait until the beginning of the traditional academic year to commence a course.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	208	An annuity is a contract sold by an insurance company that provides guaranteed payments at specified intervals for the duration of the purchaser's lifetime in exchange for an upfront cash lump sum.  Annuity contracts are a well-established feature of the pensions landscape and are likely to remain so.  They provide a secure means of converting pension savings into pension income and avoid the danger that pensioners could exhaust their pension savings in their lifetime.Notwithstanding their advantages, there has been considerable discussion as to whether the market for annuities is operating efficiently and effectively.  While the cost of annuities has risen sharply in recent years because of falling interest rates and improving longevity, there is a perception that costs are excessive and that the State could provide such products at a cheaper rate.  Other factors, including the operation of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes, which is linked to the cost of annuities, have also led to proposals that the State should play a more active role in this area.It should be noted that the State is already heavily involved in annuities through its regulatory role and through the tax concessions afforded to individuals in accumulating their retirement savings.  The State has also facilitated the development of alternative approaches to annuity provision, such as approved retirement funds for certain pension schemes.  In this regard, calls have been made to extend the availability of such alternatives to all defined contribution pensions schemes that are currently required to purchase an annuity.In keeping with the Government's aim of encouraging people to plan properly for their retirement, it is important that the annuity market serves its customers as effectively and efficiently as possible.  As part of its formulation of a comprehensive approach to future pensions policy and the Green Paper on pensions, an independent study of the Irish annuity market was commissioned to evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness.  This study examined the arguments for the State to become directly involved in the provision of annuities and the broader implications of any intervention by the State in this area.  The results of this study have informed the development of future policy.Any decision, however, on the introduction of a State annuity scheme such as that suggested by the Deputy will be considered in consultation with all relevant Departments and proposals thereafter will be reflected in the national pensions framework, which the Government is currently finalising.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	209	We are talking about yet another study to examine something that is a very good idea for cutting out the middleman.  The middleman in the pensions industry is very expensive so there are many advantages to a State annuity scheme.  Overall, the problem is that there is no current policy in this area.  There are options in respect of the State annuity scheme.  There are very attractive options for nationalising some or all of the pension schemes and for what could be done with the funds and the benefits that would accrue to pensioners.  Some 500,000 people have defined benefit schemes and they are concerned about their futures.  Their pension schemes are under-funded to the tune of €30 million.  Action must be taken and the Minister must indicate her thinking on this.  What will she do about this massive shortfall in funding of pensions?  What is her thinking with regard to the role of the State in this regard and when can we expect action?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Regarding annuities, this is not just another report.  It was carried out on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach and its findings on the cost of annuities were upheld by other professional bodies.  The report by Indecon, entitled Life Strategies, helped to guide our thinking on this matter.  It highlights that some savings could be made, particularly on commission.  It refers to the cost of capital being 6% and how, if the State took it over, there would be a more conservative mortality estimate.  I do not know why it is believed the State would take a more conservative estimate about longevity than anyone else but this would amount to 5%, with profit at 3%.  Commission would account for another 3%.  Indecon suggested that, if the State were to take over the purchases of the annuities, there could be a saving of 18%.  The Irish Association of Pension Funds estimated this figure to be 15%.  These issues must be examined.In effect, the annuity for a €10,000 per year pension costs €222,000 and any saving, whether 10% or 18%, would go back to the pension.  These are the issues we are examining.  The national pension framework is being considered by the Government and we are examining various issues.  The State is not in a position to take on a potential liability of €30 billion for all pension funds.  That figure is the liability if all funds were to close tomorrow.  There is no indication this will happen.  Many people who are worried about their pension funds will have time, over their working lives, to allow the pension fund to pick up again.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Minister is wrong in her interpretation of the matter.  She has failed to take any action on the pensions timebomb.  I remind her of the significant judgment of the European Commission in respect of the Robbins case.  The ECJ found that member states could be liable for pension shortfalls in the event of manifest and serious disregard of their obligations to ensure minimum levels of protection for employees' pensions.  The Minister has admitted a €30 billion shortfall in defined benefit pensions.  That is a manifest and serious disregard for her responsibilities, in so far as she has failed to take action and allowed 18 months to lapse since the publication of a Green Paper and she does not seem to accept that she is exposing the State to serious claims from pension funds that are wound up.  In Waterford Crystal people have been paying into a pension fund for up to 30 years and there may be no money now to pay their pensions.  In that event, a case will be taken against the Minister and the State for failing to ensure adequate protection.  When will the Minister take action on the pensions timebomb?

Will the changed environment be taken into account?  I echo what Deputy Shortall has said.  When will we see action?  The Minister's initial reply to Deputy Shortall outlined valid reasons for a State annuity scheme, yet we are no clearer on whether this is under consideration by Government.  It is very blasé of the Minister to say there is an opportunity for things to improve over the course of people's working lives.  One does not have such an opportunity if one is between 61 and 64 years of age.  It is very different for those in their 20s or 30s.  This must be taken into consideration.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The back to work allowance scheme is designed to assist the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to work.  The scheme is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.  There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work allowance for people who take up employment and the back to work enterprise allowance for people who become self-employed.To qualify for the back to work enterprise allowance, a person must set up a self-employment business that has been approved by a partnership company or one of the Department's facilitators and, in the case of a person on the live register, he or she must be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for two years prior to commencing self-employment.  Participants on the back to work enterprise allowance receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a four year period.  Participants may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.  On 20 February 2009, there were almost 7,730 participants availing of the back to work scheme, of whom 4,430 were participating in the self-employed option.The operation of the scheme has been reviewed and modified over the years to ensure it continues to remain relevant to those needing its support.  The position regarding accessing and retaining employment and self-employment has become more difficult over the past year.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is determined to ensure we do all we can to help people stay in work or get back to work as quickly as possible.  The back to work allowance scheme is being monitored on an ongoing basis in this context.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	229	This is very similar to the earlier question from Deputy Enright with regard to the back to education allowance.  The back to work enterprise allowance is a very worthwhile scheme which has significant potential.  It makes no sense to insist that a person must be on the jobseeker's payment for two years before they can avail of that scheme.  The priority in the current climate must be to ensure that the people losing their jobs now do not become the long-term unemployed of the future.  If the Government is forcing people in that position to remain on the dole for two years before they can get any assistance in setting up a new business, it will make them the long-term unemployed.This makes no sense.  A welder from Kildare who was made unemployed contacted me recently.  He saw an opening in the market to set up a small tyre garage.  He is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and it would be a big risk for him to give up all his payments in order to go into this enterprise but the State should facilitate him in trying to find new employment for himself and possibly others.What is the justification for saying to that person that he must remain unemployed for two years before he can start his enterprise?  It makes no sense at all so will the Minister please consider changing the rules?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I share with the Deputy the idea that the back to work enterprise allowance, in particular, is useful.  A distinction should be made between the back to work allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance, although both come in under the same scheme.  Approximately €80 million is set aside for the scheme for this year.  I mentioned earlier the Cabinet sub-committee on economic co-operation and one of the issues we are looking at in that respect is the enterprise element.  There are certainly many people out there with many good ideas.We should bear in mind that this is a social welfare payment not a grant to set up a business.  It facilitates people coming off long-term unemployment in setting up their own business.  I am open to a change in the scheme of the enterprise allowance.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Minister has indicated she is considering the matter but will she tell us when she will make a decision?  Many people out there know they will face unemployment very shortly and they are already trying to come up with enterprise ideas.Whatever about public finances and the banks, the one factor required to fix the economy is job creation.  There are many people who want to get into what may be best described as garage industries and we need more enterprise parks to facilitate this.  All of that rides on the back of this very laudable scheme, which is an excellent idea.  When will the Minister make a decision on bringing the required waiting period down to perhaps a maximum of three months?  After this people may develop bad habits and get out of the work ethic.  They should be allowed to go back to work and to create other jobs on the back of this.

The logic behind this is that when people come out of work they have experience and fresh ideas that, in a shorter period, could be transferred to a job where they could work for themselves.  Will we have a response on this by the time the budget comes forward early next month?
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I welcome the Minister's statement that this matter is under serious consideration and that there should be a decision within the next few weeks.  I urge the Minister to consider a reasonable time lag, perhaps of three months.  If somebody has lost his or her job and comes up with an idea for a small enterprise, three months seems very reasonable in the current climate.  I look forward to an early announcement on that.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	239	We are working on the issue.

I see the value of trying to encourage people who have ideas and may employ not only themselves but others.  We want to facilitate them as much as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Under the national employment action plan, NEAP, all people between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching three months on the live register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them enter or re-enter the labour market.  The NEAP process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  The plan was introduced in 1998 and implemented on a phased basis using various age and duration thresholds.Each month, a statistical report published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is produced outlining the main outcomes for those who have been referred since the beginning of the year.  Information on outcomes is based primarily on FÁS caseload records of interactions with those interviewed.  This is supplemented by information on reasons for leaving the live register, given by individuals to my own Department, where this information has not been communicated directly to FÁS by the individuals concerned.The figures referred to are taken from the NEAP monthly progress report for November 2008.  The report covers all referrals for the period January to October 2008 and is based on known outcomes as at the end of November 2008.  Of those referred in that period, 56% had left the live register by the end of November 2008.  Data relating to years 2000 to 2007 is contained in the Department's annual statistical report and the figure of 56% for 2008 compares favourably with the rates of previous years, particularly given the current economic climate.People remain on the live register while engaged with FÁS under the action plan until they take up offers of employment or training.  If they do not attend for interview with FÁS or, having engaged with FÁS, decline offers of employment or training, their cases are referred back to the social welfare local office for review to determine if they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.  People who for valid reasons are unable to avail of the opportunities for placement in employment, training or education provided by FÁS continue to receive payment.  In such cases, the Department's facilitator service is available to assist them in identifying barriers to participation and exploring alternative progression routes.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I doubt that the 60 people in the facilitator service can deal with the level of unemployment we currently have.  People must sign off social welfare when they go on FÁS courses and the 44% of people who do not manage to get employment from the courses must then sign back on.I have heard from many people working within both FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs that this must be changed.  A person gets the same payment while on the FÁS course as on jobseeker's allowance, and there is an extra payment for child care that can still be paid by FÁS.  Some of the FÁS courses are three, four or five weeks long and people must go through the entire process of signing off and getting the payment from FÁS.  When the person is finished the FÁS course, he or she must go back to the Department's staff —  who are inundated as it is —  and go through the process of signing back on.I am not sure how many people within the Department are allocated to that process but it is a sizable number.  I know of a pilot project near my locality, although I am not sure it was official, where FÁS was in communication with the Department.  Two out of three local social welfare offices agreed that the people involved could stay signing on.  This eliminated all the paperwork that was taking up staff time and which makes people consider if it is worth doing a FÁS course because a process will have to be gone through and the person may have to wait for a payment at the end.  Some people are not willing to take that chance.  Will the Minister examine the issue and see if the practice could be changed?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	246	We are looking at all cases to see how we can streamline processes.  I mentioned earlier people going from jobseeker's allowance to jobseeker's benefit looking for information and this would fall into that category, as people may go to FÁS and come back.  Another example is where people working in the education sector contact social welfare offices during mid-term break and holiday periods.  They would not be in receipt of social welfare benefit when working, whether engaged in filing or other jobs but we need to examine if a way can found to streamline the process in terms of people being paid, given the heavy burden of work on staff in local social welfare offices.On the question of the referral of people for courses, Deputy Enright mentioned the similar benefit rates people are paid but the different additional benefits they receive.  There is a need to streamline the rates payable to people participating in different education courses that come under the remit of different Departments.  Two people may be doing the same course, one under the VTOS and the other under the back to education scheme and one or other of those scheme may include a travel allowance, food allowance or child allowances.  These are the types of issues we are examining.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I will allow some brief supplementary questions.  I call Deputy Shortall.

Does the Minister accept that there is a strong argument for bringing FÁS employment services under the remit of her Department and having one coherent service to ensure people need not wonder whether they should go to the local LES or FÁS office or deal with the job facilitators in the Department of Social and Family Affairs?  There seems to be a scattergun approach to this area, which means many people are falling through the cracks.  Has the Minister given any consideration to streamlining this process?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Some would say that the some of the FÁS training courses should come under the remit of the Department of Education and Science.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	251	These turf war arguments go on between Departments, but the important point is that there is good co-operation among them, whether it be through the partnerships or through the LES.  The Deputy is correct in saying that a myriad of bodies provide such services.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has a responsibility for a number of them as well.  There is good co-operation among the various groups and it is important that continues.FÁS has upped its game significantly in terms of the number of people who are now being called.  We need to recognise that.  Thousands of additional places have been created this year to ensure that people are called after the three month period and that as many people as possible are facilitated.  Some 60,260 were referred last year and of those 40,000 were interviewed but the other 20,000 disappeared off the live register.  The calling of people for interview is a good control element in that it can be established if a person got a job the previous week or whatever.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I want to facilitate the Deputies.  I call Deputy Morgan.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I agree with the Minister and with Deputy Enright.  Reform is needed in this area.  I do not want to miss the opportunity presented to ask the Minister to impress upon her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that FÁS clearly needs freshening up.  It does some great work and the bad news coverage of the bad practices in the organisation was unfortunate.  Does the Minister agree that FÁS should liaise with some enterprise development groups to facilitate discussion to encourage and help the many people who want to return to work and to create their own jobs to do so?
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	254	There are 60 facilitators, one for every 7,500 people unemployed.  What do they do that is different from what the FÁS employment service does?
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	255	A large number of people will leave school this year and there will not be jobs for them.  Does the Minister accept there is a strong case for ensuring that people cannot go from school on to the dole and that they will progress directly from school into a training course?  This issue will arise on a large scale this year and in the coming years.  That is the critical time to catch people to prevent them falling into unemployment and dependency on perhaps a long-term basis.  Has the Minister given any consideration to providing that type of course for school leavers to enable them to improve their chances of getting employment in the future?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Three issues were raised.  In reply to Deputy Morgan's question on FÁS training courses, new initiatives were taken to ensure that training is available in the installation of green energy projects, etc.  New courses are being offered.  The more people who are able to move off the live register and into training the better.  Such upskilling of people who have lost their jobs in the construction industry will allow them to avail of new opportunities.  That is one example of a new initiative which can work well.On the question of the difference between the facilitators and the FÁS employment service, the facilitators take a broader approach in that they will also identify whether a literacy course, a course under a back to education scheme or under back to work scheme is the most appropriate.   They do not only have an employment perspective, they examine the education and training needs of the person concerned and work individually with the person.  That is useful also.Deputy Shortall asked about 18 year olds coming onto the live register.  It is interesting that even in the good times —  I know this from visiting social welfare offices throughout the country —  some people still walk into the social welfare office on their 18th birthday to sign on.  There is this form of generational unemployment and if it continued during the good times, one can only imagine how bad it will get when jobs are more scarce.Two pilot projects have been introduced in Letterkenny and Coolock, which appear to be working well and which I would be anxious to extend.  Such projects would ensure that 18 to 20 year olds who come in to sign on will be immediately put on a training course rather than be in receipt of social welfare benefit.  I would like to see more of that.  It is a bad idea to hand €204.30 per week to 18 year olds.  I would rather see them get the benefit of education and training, and I am happy to——
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	257	We need to move beyond pilot schemes at this stage.  A national scheme is needed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	258	This would be a major shift in policy which I would be happy to implement.  It has been the policy that whether one is 18 years old with no work record or 50 years old with a 30 years' work record, one can sign on and get €204.30 a week.  This would be a significant change.  I share the Deputy's views that it would be far better to have the 18 to 20 year olds involved in education and training and given an allowance, which refers to that, rather than giving them something which could lead to them becoming unemployed and dependent at a very early age.  The projects appear to be working quite well.  We will learn from them and I would be happy to extend them as quickly as possible.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	261	Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard, the sponsors-trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years.  The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.There are currently 1,355 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefits pension schemes are in deficit.  However, the full extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.The Government is very conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds during the past year.  We are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.The Government is continuing to consider the issues in regard to both the maintenance of the funding standard and the wider issue of future security of the supplementary pensions sector.  We recently implemented a number of short-term measures to ease the pressures currently being felt by many pension funds. Those measures include the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals; granting flexibility to the Pensions Board to allow longer periods —  more than 10 years —  for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances; enabling the board to allow the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan in certain circumstances; and enabling the board to take into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans. To ensure that these concessions are not seen as a weakening of supervision arrangements, the Pensions Board will not accept recovery plans which do not demonstrate an appropriate investment approach.  I believe that these measures will help all schemes currently in difficulty and will help to ensure the best outcomes for the scheme members.

There has been a lack of effective regulation in this area.  Another aspect that is of equal importance was the lack of awareness among employees of the risks to which they were being exposed in that they are only now discovering, in the light of what has happened in Waterford Crystal, the risk to which they are exposed in terms of their pensions.  Is the Government considering providing any type of State guarantee for occupational pensions schemes that are in deficit?  The Minister said she is examining this area and that a report will be published.  When will it be published?  Can she at least advise the House today what exact area she is examining in this context?  Is this issue being examined in that context?  Is the Government considering providing any type of State guarantee for these schemes?  Effectively, a massive failure of regulation has exposed hundreds of thousands of people at this stage.  The schemes were too heavily invested in equities.  In good times they were able to take money out.  Now we see the result with approximately 90% in deficit.  When does the Minister expect the results for the 1,355 schemes so that we can get an accurate figure rather than that 90% assumption?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I do not accept that there has been poor regulation of the funds.  However, because they are investment funds, the value of the investments has fallen.  Where there is scope for further regulation and tightening up —  as there is in some cases —  we will certainly do that, particularly in the case of employers etc. who are not handing over the pension contributions.  We are looking at that.  However it is bound by the Pensions Act 1990 and the trust law.  As I indicated earlier where changes were needed for the short term, we have certainly made those.The Deputy asked about a pension protection fund effectively offering a State guarantee.  That would basically transfer the risk to the State, which is a major risk.  It would involve an agency running the scheme, investing resources and paying.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	265	If we consider what has happened in other countries, the USA established such a fund that is now €11 billion in deficit.  The UK has 68 schemes that are part of its protection fund with 20,000 members.  Some 7,500 schemes are eligible to enter it with a potential deficit of €200 billion.  This is what is happening in other countries that have a state protection fund.  The Government is not in a position to offer such protection to such funds.  Obviously we will try to ensure we make the process as easy as possible and support it in whatever way we can.  At the moment the 1,300 or so defined benefit schemes here have liabilities of approximately €100 billion and the provisional estimate is that they would be €30 billion in deficit.

This is not something she can wash her hands of and claim it is nothing to do with the State.  The issue for the State is its failure to ensure adequate pension protection.  Arising out of the Robbins case the Government is legally required to do that.  Its failure to do that is exposing the State to legal action.  A pensions expert recently said that members of direct benefit schemes enjoy all the protection of a chocolate fireguard and that the Minister's recent minor actions in this regard were the equivalent of adding a couple of marshmallows to that chocolate fireguard.For the third time today I ask the Minister when she will take her responsibilities seriously in respect of pension provision.  When will she take decisions arising from the protracted Green Paper process?  When can we expect her to make a policy announcement?

There are many people who had expectations from their pension schemes, believing they had a guarantee of a particular pension following all their contributions only to find it was not a guarantee and that they were at the mercy of whatever the investment was at the time.  There is no doubt that there is an obligation and should be further obligations on pension fund managers etc. to ensure that their clients know the consequences of the payments they are making.  As I have indicated the short-term and long-term issues are before Government at the moment.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue, which has been somewhat truncated from the original matter submitted.  My concern is with children known to be at risk and notified to the health board or HSE as being at risk who have lost their lives or children who have lost their lives having already found their way into the care system.  On 19 February I asked the Minister of State with responsibility for children to detail the number of children who have died in the past ten years and who had been notified as being at risk.  I was astonished to discover that not only did the Minister of State not know the numbers who had died but also it appears the HSE had not even bothered to collate them.  The reply stated:I have asked the Health Service Executive to gather the information requested and to forward this information to the Deputy.  The Health Service Executive has advised, that due to the length of the period covered by the question it will of necessity take some time to compile as material will have to be retrieved from the archives.I would have thought that circumstances in which children lost their lives, having been reported to a health board or the HSE to be at risk would have been properly recorded and the background detail would have been known and properly investigated.  That does not seem to have been the case.Some days after I received the reply to that parliamentary question, Carl O'Brien, the social affairs correspondent of The Irish Times, reported that:A total of 20 children who were placed in the care of the State have died over a six-year period, new figures show.Five young people died from drug overdoses, two from traffic accidents, two from assaults and two from suicide according to the Health Service Executive.Carl O'Brien's source of information is not revealed and this information was apparently leaked to him.  Where children taken into our care system lose their lives it should not be a matter of secrecy as to the circumstances in which they lost their lives or as to what action if any could have been taken by a health authority to provide them with protection.  We have an excessive amount of secrecy and a total lack of transparency.To her credit, in April 2007, the Ombudsman for Children recommended to the then Minister for Health and Children, who also happens to be the current Minister, that consideration be given to the establishment of a mechanism to review systematically child deaths in the State.  A year ago she held a seminar on the issue.  Two years after the recommendation was made by her it seems absolutely nothing has been done despite a decision of the European Court which imposes an obligation on all states to ensure deaths of children —  particularly those who should have been taken into care or who were in care —  are properly and independently investigated.  This requires a sufficient element of public scrutiny for the investigation of its results to ensure accountability.We are in the extraordinary position of knowing the names of some children taken into care who have lost their lives.  There was the tragic case of Tracey Fay in respect of which the HSE received an internal report towards the end of 2008.  Tracey Fay died of a fatal drugs overdose in 2002.  It apparently took six years for the HSE to receive a review of what had occurred.  It is reported that the review found that instead of providing her with stable accommodation, a local health authority provided a "chaotic" response, including 20 different bed and breakfasts, hospital beds, a bench in an accident and emergency unit and two different dedicated services.  I do not know whether Tracey Fay's life could have been saved.  I do not know how adequate or otherwise the child care interventions were.  However, I know that in a democracy it is entirely unacceptable that it took six years to produce this report and the report is apparently a State secret.  It has been at least three months since the HSE received it and, for all I know, with the HSE late 2008 could be any time between September and December 2008.  The Tracey Fay report has not been published.  The same applies to the tragic death of David Foley, who was found dead in a flat off Blackhall Place in Dublin's north inner city on Saturday, 10 September 2005.  Three years earlier, he entered the care system as a 14-year old child.  David Foley, like Tracy Fay, was totally failed by our child care system.

We should learn the essential lessons from these deaths to ensure the mistakes made are not repeated and other children do not lose their lives.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who unfortunately cannot be present to respond.The Health Service Executive is required under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Where a child requires care or protection that he or she is unlikely to receive unless the child is taken into care, the Health Service Executive must take the child into its care and provide the most appropriate form of alternative care for that child.With regard to statistics, there are over 5,300 children in the care of the HSE.  Over 92% of these children are placed with foster families, with the remaining children placed in residential settings.  During the period 2000 to date, there was a total of 21 deaths of children in the care of the HSE.  The causes of death were as follows: three deaths by suicide; two deaths by assault; two deaths by road traffic accident; five drug-related deaths; and nine deaths from medical issues.In regard to the other statistics sought by Deputy Shatter, the Health Service Executive is in the process of compiling the information requested.  The Deputy will appreciate that due to the length of the period covered by the request, it will, of necessity, take some time to compile as material will have to be retrieved from the archives.  However, every effort will be made to gather the data requested and to submit it to the Deputy within a reasonable timeframe.The death of any child in care is a serious matter and requires careful and detailed consideration.  Prior to the establishment of the HSE in 2005, individual health boards had procedures in place for dealing with deaths of children in care.  I understand that as part of an ongoing process of standardisation the HSE is currently reviewing its procedures for dealing with deaths of children in its care, and a high level group in the HSE has been delegated to oversee the development of standard protocols for this area.The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is in regular contact with the Health Service Executive in regard to the status of any reviews, inquiries or investigations which are currently being undertaken on individual cases.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Health and Children is monitoring and will continue to monitor the implementation of any recommendations arising from such reviews and inquiries.  The Department will also continue to raise these matters at the regular meetings held between senior officials of the Health Service Executive and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on child welfare and protection issues.The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is participating in an initiative undertaken by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children regarding the possible establishment in this country of a child death review mechanism.  A high level seminar was hosted by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in April 2008.  The items considered at the seminar included current practice in Ireland, the objectives of child death review, child death review methodologies and operational considerations.The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has also recently prepared a child death review options paper.  As well as providing the background to the process to date, the paper outlines human rights considerations, options around individual reviews of child death and relevant research.  The paper notes that "international experience differs on the relative value of individual case review as opposed to an approach to child death which examines broader trends at a demographic level".  The paper goes on to state, "it may be that in certain instances child deaths do not give rise to wider systemic concerns and reviewing them will therefore not enhance our understanding of what makes children vulnerable".  In its conclusions, the paper states that the impetus for the initiative stems from the belief that the establishment of a system would lead to a deeper understanding of the factors which render children vulnerable.  I understand that the Ombudsman for Children has written to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children to inform it of developments in this regard and intends to share the options paper and other documentation with it in the near future.In conclusion, I reiterate the Government's commitment to address the crucial challenge of protecting the most vulnerable members of our society.  When families fail children for whatever reason, the children must be protected by society and the State, which is a complex and difficult task.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	284	We live in interesting times and virtually every sector of Government funding has been hard hit by cutbacks, a levy, a budget and, next month, a mini-budget, all of which has happened in the space of six months.  It is therefore not surprising that the national drugs strategy has suffered a reduction in its budget from €37 million to €34 million.  Every local drugs task force, State agency and community group providing a local drugs service is worried about cutbacks and funding for their services and projects.  They are worried about loss of staff through redundancies and the inability to plan for the full financial year.It is particularly alarming to hear that funding for the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing and Threats initiative is now capped at €300,000 and will be unlikely to be able to proceed after June of this year.  This programme has been piloted successfully in a number of rural and urban areas, including the north inner city in my own constituency.  It provides a confidential telephone line which can be used in privacy and with absolute security by drug addicts, their families, neighbours and others who are often subjected to intimidation by drug barons to extract money from them or to force them to sell drugs.  Gardaí regard this programme as a valuable resource in the fight against drugs.  It is not expensive and becomes more and more cost-effective as it is rolled out throughout the country.  It would be a shame if it became another casualty of the recession.It appears that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is using the backdrop and cover of the recession and the budgetary cutbacks to restructure the national drugs strategy without any consultation with its component parts.  The national drugs strategy is a complex edifice which has multi-agency and community participation at its heart.  If this co-operative and holistic approach is undermined, the entire edifice will collapse, which would be disastrous as the present approach is the only one that can work.The Garda, with all the legislation in the world, cannot deal with the drugs threat effectively.  As the unemployment queues increase alarmingly, regeneration schemes shelved or collapsed and marginalised communities become more marginalised, the ground becomes increasingly fertile for the drugs barons to ply their trade.  This is not the time for retrenchment within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is not the time to abandon the tried and tested multifaceted approach or to centralise the delivery of services to those vulnerable and marginalised people affected by substance abuse the length and breadth of Ireland.  I ask the Minister to retain the integrated partnership approach that values community participation in decision making at local, regional and national level in the drugs strategy, and not to jeopardise the real progress made over the past 12 years.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, who is not available.Details of a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009-16 have not yet been finalised.  A steering group comprising representatives of the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, is currently finalising its proposals in regard to the strategy.  It is expected that its recommendations will be received by the end of March.  Once the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, has considered them, he will then seek Government approval for a new strategy in April, with publication to follow as quickly as possible thereafter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, indicated in his statement last week to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that significant changes have occurred in the pattern of drug use since the current strategy was developed.  In particular, the number of drugs being used has increased, polydrug usage occurs to a greater extent and problem drug use has spread across most of the country.  It is important that the new strategy addresses problem drug use as it currently manifests itself.The steering group has reached agreement on the actions necessary regarding supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation measures.  It is finalising the consideration of actions relating to research, as well as the structures that should be utilised to best facilitate the effective implementation of the strategy.The development of a new strategy presents an opportunity to examine the structures through which the overall effort to tackle the drugs problem is addressed.  The Minister looks forward to the recommendations of the steering group in this regard, and he hopes a framework can be devised that will preserve the best aspects of the current strategy, including partnership across the sectors, while better facilitating governance, management and effectiveness.Ireland's economic circumstances have changed significantly even since the process of developing the new strategy began last year.  The improvement of service provision remains a goal but without significant additional resources this will have to be achieved by promoting efficiency in services, focusing on those that can produce real results and fostering interagency working to the benefit of all.As with any area of public spending, the policies to tackle the drugs problem must be implemented within the financial parameters faced in any given year.  In the current economic climate, the challenge of utilising our resources effectively is even more relevant.  Furthermore, it is important to note that the new strategy will cover a period of eight years and the economic circumstances can fluctuate considerably over such a period.This Government is firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in our society.  This is reflected in the fact that the relative reduction in the 2009 funding allocation to my Department for the drugs initiatives is quite small.  In 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the local and regional drugs task force areas was nearly €34.8 million.  Funding for 2009 will be approximately €34.6 million, of which more than €23 million is being allocated to local drugs task forces and more than €11 million to regional groups.Unfortunately, no area is immune from cost-cutting measures in the current economic environment.  It is in this context that all drugs task forces were asked to identify savings across their areas of responsibility.  Although it is appreciated this will involve difficult choices, it is a matter for the drugs task forces to identify measures to enable them to work within their allocated budgets.Across Government, we are taking a number of difficult decisions, but our approach is to do this in as balanced a way as possible.  There is a critical need to ensure resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that the maximum benefit is achieved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, wishes me to assure the Deputy that his primary concern has been, and continues to be, the protection of front-line services delivering vital programmes and initiatives in areas worst affected by problem drug use.Projects have been approved funding for the first six months of 2009 and this expenditure will be reviewed before allocating funding for the second six-month period.  Work will continue with the drug task forces to ensure this funding is targeted in the most appropriate manner.  The Minister of State is confident that the funding in 2009 will continue to facilitate the delivery of meaningful and viable community-based initiatives to address problem drug use.The drugs strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Departments and agencies and the allocation to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services across these bodies.  In 2008, it was estimated that total expenditure on drugs programmes was approximately €264 million.  The figures for 2009 are being compiled, but preliminary estimates, produced for a meeting today of the inter-departmental group on drugs, indicate that spending across all Departments will be maintained at this level.The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, awaits the outcome of the steering group's deliberations before finalising proposals on a new national drugs strategy.  He wishes to assure the Deputy the new strategy will focus on countering problem drug use in our society and that securing appropriate financing over the coming years, and driving a value for money approach, will be central features of its implementation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Early last Saturday I flew across the Dublin north fringe region, returning from Galway with Aer Arann.  From the air, the starkness of the construction closedown in the area is immediately visible.  Large cleared areas of fields are marked out with roads and boundary fences but all activity has ceased effectively since early last autumn.Vital public transport, shopping, health, security and community services remain to be provided for the major districts of the north fringe, such as The Coast, Stapolin, Clongriffin, Beaupark and Belmayne.  The long promised new DART station for Baldoyle-Clongriffin has not been delivered and new residents now hope the latest target date of October 2009 will prove to be accurate.  In the south of Belmayne, construction seems to have stopped completely over a vast area of apartments.  From Clare Hall Avenue, the vast new estate looks uncared for and unfinished.In the same district four months ago, local residents received the shocking news that the proposed new town square at Belmayne-Clare Hall was not going to proceed as planned.  The key Belmayne developers, Stanley Holdings, pulled out of the purchase and development of the 9.3 hectare town square site, agreed under a section 183 agreement with Dublin City Council in August 2006.  The Belmayne town square was to be a centrepiece of the north fringe development, linked by a new long urban boulevard to Clongriffin and Stapolin town centre in the east.The astonishing debacle of the Belmayne town centre is typical of the poor planning and management of the new north fringe by Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  More than seven years ago, I proposed the local informal stakeholders' body, the North Fringe Forum, which tries to invigilate the vast new north fringe development.  The forum is concerned with a development of potentially 25,000 to 30,000 housing units and ancillary commercial development which is easily the largest such development in the history of the State.However, unlike much smaller areas like Adamstown, Mansfield and Balgaddy, the north fringe is not a strategic development zone. I  call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to give the north fringe strategic development zone status without further delay.  Only by placing the north fringe on a statutory SDZ basis and insisting that the Dublin City and Fingal county managers establish a clear five to seven-year scoping and planning timetable can the urgent needs of existing new residents be met and a full sustainable development plan activated for this crucially important new urban quarter of Dublin City and Fingal County.The Commercial Court in Clonskeagh is currently hearing an action by Menolly Homes, Mansfield Developments and associated companies against three companies in the Lagan Group, including Irish Asphalt, the owners of the Bay Lane quarry in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15.  The matter is now sub judice and the judgment will have immense consequences for the young constituents I represent in several areas of the north fringe.  The issue at stake relates to allegations of serious pyrite contamination of infill used in housing construction in Clongriffin, The Coast, Drynam Hall, and in several other areas of north and west Dublin and east Leinster.I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not present, although I acknowledge the good attributes of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  For almost two years I have pleaded with the Minister to establish a task force on pyrite contamination of buildings erected during the Celtic tiger period, similar to action taken by the government of Québec province in Canada.  I have asked him perhaps 20 times in this House to close Bay Lane quarry immediately and to carry out a full traceability audit of the two million tonnes of infill material taken from it.  We have traced only 5% of it.  I have asked him repeatedly to invigilate all the other quarries in Leinster for possible pyrite contamination.  Why has the Minister and Leader of the Green Party stood helplessly on the sidelines while young householders, whose homes are literally coming apart, are left to fend for themselves?  During this time companies such as Killoe Developments refused to take calls for months on end.Surely this is another great betrayal by the Green Party and a dereliction of duty by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is now abundantly clear that the building regulations were greatly, and deliberately, weakened by this 12-year-old Government.  We have a so-called self-regulatory system.  In autumn 2007, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, tried to close the stable door when the horse was clearly gone, with his letter to local authorities on regulatory responsibility.  The key responsibility is now his alone.  I appeal to him, for the umpteenth time, to establish an SDZ for the north fringe and a task force on pyrites.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The Deputy will be aware that certain matters relating to the problems which have arisen in relation to the use of pyrite as infill are currently the subject of proceedings before the Commercial Court.The Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that the Government may, by order, when so proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, designate one or more sites for the establishment of a strategic development zone to facilitate development deemed to be of economic or social importance to the State.The benefit of SDZ designation is the co-ordinated planning and development of undeveloped sites, with a good degree of certainty on the exact type and nature of development, following the determination by An Bord Pleanála of a planning scheme, which is prepared by the nominated development agency.  However, the Minister does not believe a strategic development zone would be the appropriate vehicle to deliver on existing development, such as that at the Dublin north fringe, because there is already an existing and formally adopted framework plan applying to that area.  This plan has guided considerable development in recent years and continues to be the basis against which planning permissions and all ancillary developments are considered.  Moreover, the Deputy will be aware that a broad-based north fringe cross-authority-agency forum is also in place to monitor progress in this area.The Minister has already had occasion to outline to the House initiatives which have been taken by Fingal County Council, by his Department and by the National Standards Authority of Ireland following from the problems which have occurred regarding pyrite in certain developments.  When the issue of pyrite arose and following an intervention from the Department, the NSAI proceeded to publish a new amended standard recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new standard recommendation is intended to address the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  The Department has now incorporated this NSAI standard recommendation into the relevant technical guidance document associated with Part C of the building regulations dealing with site preparation and resistance to moisture.  The Department has also notified all key stakeholders of the provisions of the amended TGD-C.  In addition, the Minister is aware that HomeBond has included the amended NSAI standard recommendation in their published sixth edition of the House Building Manual.The Minister, Deputy  Gormley is satisfied that these measures represent an appropriate response and there are no proposals to establish a task force or to order a traceability audit of materials in relation to this matter.The fact remains that problems arising between homeowners and their builders are matters for resolution between the parties concerned —  the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurer.  Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Science, to provide additional funding for Colehill national school, a rural school, probably the largest in County Longford, for sewerage treatment replacement works, traffic management installations and fire safety certificate requirements, such as access roadway for fire tenders to the rear of school and a 30,000 gallon water storage tank for fire fighting.Colehill national school is grateful to the Department of Education and Science for the funding it has received to date.  However the outstanding works required by this school are essential to the health and safety of its pupils.  The burden of these works has been imposed by necessity and by the requirements of Longford County Council.  I am aware that the sewerage upgrade has been applied for under the summer works scheme 2009 and I would be much obliged if the Minister could confirm that this scheme will go ahead as planned this year.However, of particular concern to me is the issue of fire safety requirements.  Longford County Council is right to enforce measures for the protection of the pupils of this school in respect of fire regulations.  However, the money is simply not there to provide the necessary facilities.  The school is currently facing a bill of €189,196.67 for additional infrastructure.  The items arising due to fire safety certificate requirements have been costed at €39,725.00 for a 30,000 gallon static tank for fire-fighting due to the inadequacy of the group water scheme in terms of volume and pressure and €16,591.92 for the provision of an access roadway for fire tenders to the rear of the school.The foul water sewerage treatment system replacement works will require an outlay of €53,345.00.  The existing septic tank and percolation area overflows into the playing fields approximately twice a year, which is a significant health and hygiene hazard.  The cost of revised bus and car set-down areas, including parking, as required by Longford County Council has been costed at €68,214.75.  Such vehicular access provision has a direct impact on pedestrian safety which is of the utmost importance in a school environment.The overall cost of the works at Colehill school is €680,449.40, with €360,000 already received from the Department and this is much appreciated.  The school is left with a deficit, in total of €320,449.40 in funding.  Nevertheless the school has proceeded with the project and is actively fund-raising for which I compliment the principal, Bríd Lynn and the other teachers, the board of management and the parents for taking the initiative to go ahead with a project in the interests of safety but the money is not there to pay for it.  However given the small local population and current financial climate, Colehill national school would be grateful for any additional funding to meet health and safety requirements.  We have all read stories of fires that went rapidly out of control due to inadequate fire-fighting facilities.  We cannot afford to put the lives of our children at risk in any way.I ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider the problems facing this school and to see fit to assist it to meet all of the safety requirements of Longford County Council in regard to safety and health issues.  I would appreciate a positive response to this Adjournment matter.  The need for health and safety in our schools and in other environments where the public congregate cannot be emphasised often enough.  It is important from a health and safety point of view that funding be made available.  The principal has taken the initiative but it has to be paid for somehow.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science, who could not be in attendance.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the allocation of funding for St. Sinneach's national school, Colehill, County Longford and the operation of the Department's devolved permanent accommodation scheme.The management authorities of this school applied for and were approved for funding under the 2007 permanent accommodation scheme.  A grant of €360,000 was sanctioned to enable the provision of an extension consisting of three classrooms.  The school had an enrolment of 167 pupils at September 2008 and a mainstream staffing of a principal and five assistant teachers.  The general position is that the Department moved towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for smaller building projects-refurbishments directly to school management authorities in 2003 with the introduction, on a pilot basis, of the devolved small schools and permanent accommodation schemes.  Due to the positive feedback from schools the schemes were extended to include additional schools in subsequent years.The permanent accommodation scheme allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project.The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake desired building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools granted discretion and funding must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.The authorities of the Colehill school accepted the grant offer and returned a form of undertaking agreeing to comply with the requirements of the scheme.  Following the tendering process the school's building proposals would cost over €220,000 in excess of the €360,000 on offer to the school.  The school requested that the shortfall be funded by the Department.This request for significant additional funding was considered in the Department.  However, in line with the original intention of the permanent accommodation scheme, it was considered that the school should be encouraged to complete the project within the funding envelope provided and, accordingly, the application for additional grant aid was not granted.In the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to entertain such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to schools. It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.  The board of management should take the necessary steps to ensure that the scope of the works undertaken matches the funding being allowed.  The Minister for Education and Science regrets that the response is not more favourable on this occasion, but it is important that the Department ensures that grant aid is managed prudently.As the Deputy may be aware, a total of €656 million will be spent under the Department's school building programme this year alone. It is important to ensure that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure that value for money is achieved for the taxpayer. This will ensure the completion of the maximum number of projects from within the funds available to the Department for the school building programme under the current national development plan.This school also made an application under the deferred 2008 summer works scheme for funding.  The Minister for Education and Science intends to have a summer works scheme this year.  The level of funding to be made available for the 2009 scheme is being considered.  In the meantime, applications submitted for the summer works scheme in 2008, including the application from Colehill national school, are currently being assessed and the schools will be notified of the outcome of this assessment in due course.  The professional and technical reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 55 together.The Department has worked closely with Area Based Partnership Companies since their inception on issues relating to the broad social inclusion agenda and in particular on addressing the needs of the unemployed and the long term unemployed, and in doing so, has worked closely with other members of Partnerships at Board and working committee levels.The Local Employment Service is under the aegis of FÁS and the Department has for many years worked closely with FÁS in particular in delivering the National Employment Action Plan under which unemployed customers are systematically referred to FÁS to support their efforts in accessing employment.There is very close co-operation between the local offices of the Department, local partnership companies and local employment services including FÁS. Under the memorandum of understanding between FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, staff from both agencies hold regular meetings in order to discuss the operation of the employment action plan and to deal with any issues arising.The Department has representatives on the board of local partnership companies throughout the country.  In recent times the discussion has focused on how best the agencies can work together in supporting the unemployed with their training and educational needs at a time when there are limited employment opportunities. All agencies are challenged on how best to support unemployed ‘job ready' customers who have high educational qualifications. However some of these customers have gone directly from college into employment and are in need of training in job seeking and interview skills.These meetings at local level between officials of the Department and those providing employment supports ensure enhanced services to customers.The operation of Partnership companies and the programmes they implement is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  However, I understand that through that Department's cohesion process, the services provided by the Urban Partnerships and Integrated Companies are now available county-wide to all residents irrespective of location.The Department of Social and Family Affairs, through its employment support and other services, has assisted many people away from long-term unemployment and back into the workforce.  At present a network of facilitators works closely at local level with social welfare customers, including those on the live register, in order to determine training and development needs.   In recent months the number of facilitator posts has been increased from 40 to 60.  These facilitators arrange, through direct provision or jointly with other agencies, appropriate training and developmental programmes to equip customers to progress to employment, enhance their parenting skills or otherwise improve their life opportunities. Facilitators have access to some additional services, such as the special projects and family services funds which provide funding for specialised training and supports for those who are distant from the labour market and who need additional help in preparing them for further training and employment.The Social and Economic Participation Programme under the national Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 is aimed at all people of working age regardless of the circumstances that led the person to require income maintenance. The cost of the programme will be €50m over the duration of the NDP 2007-2013.  In the first 3 years €13m will be invested, following which the programme will be reviewed and a decision made on the extent and content of the programme over the following years.  The enhanced facilitation service will build on the Department's existing experience and income maintenance relationship with the people concerned, in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as FÁS, VECs, the HSE and other local agencies. The vision is of a single transparent system with a primary focus on the customer.For those on the Live Register, the main welfare to work measure is the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP). Under this plan, people who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.There is also a range of support services in place to assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients to return to the active labour market either by taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  These are provided through the operation of the Back to Education and Back to Work Allowance Schemes, the Technical Assistance and Training Grants and the PRSI Exemption Scheme.  Activation and Family Services Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme also offer supports to social welfare customers and other disadvantaged persons to assist them to improve their employability and personal and family situations.Overall, I am satisfied that the existing arrangements together with the proposed wider activation programme under the NDP provide a satisfactory level of coordination among all of the relevant bodies to ensure that the needs of the most marginalised are met in a positive manner.In the light of the extent of this coordination the alignment of the catchment areas of Social Welfare offices, local Partnership areas and Local Employment Services is not considered necessary.

The scheme provides a short-term "safety net" within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.There are currently over 9,800 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of almost 5,700 (138%) over the number in payment at end 2007.The assessment for the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  In view of the current economic environment, the Department has commenced a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined.The mortgage interest supplement scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the department. The operational arrangements for the processing of applications and the payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.I understand that the HSE is currently reviewing the allocation of staff currently engaged on the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including mortgage interest supplement.The question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.Entitlement to a social insurance payment is based, among other things, on fulfilling the social insurance contribution conditions for the particular benefit being claimed. A person claiming jobseeker's benefit is required to have paid a minimum number of contributions since they first started working and also to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year.These contribution rules aim to preserve a balance between the level of contributions paid and the amount of benefits received in terms of the rate of payment and the duration for which the payment will be made.  This approach is informed by the contributory principle of the social insurance system, whereby contributors build an entitlement to benefits by having themselves made significant contributions. The principle protects both the entitlements of contributors and the rationale for the social insurance fund. The fund, having recorded a surplus of income over expenditure since 1995, recorded a deficit in 2008. A further shortfall is expected this year and although these current deficits can be met from the accumulated surplus, it looks likely that the Exchequer may yet again have to subsidise expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund within a few years.The number of people claiming short-term benefits, such as Illness and Jobseeker's Benefit has increased significantly in recent years. In this context, the Government considered it appropriate to look at some of the instances where people with very limited or distant contribution record have been able to qualify for very significant benefits, regardless of their household income.  It had been the case that a person who had paid just 52 PRSI contributions in total could qualify for jobseeker's benefit.This meant that migrants or young workers who had only worked for a total of one year were entitled to claim jobseeker's payments for 12 months, without having to satisfy a means test.From January 2009, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for the benefit was raised to 104 for new claimants to bring greater balance between the contributions made and the benefits received.In addition, it had been the case that people who had paid 260 or more PRSI contributions could receive jobseeker's benefit for up to 15 months.  From 15 October, 2008, this has been limited to 12 months for existing claimants with less than six months duration on the scheme as well as for all new claimants.  Where the claimant has paid less than 260 PRSI contributions, the maximum duration of jobseeker's benefit is 9 months (instead of 12 months) for existing claimants who have been in receipt of benefit for less than three months and for all new claimants.People who are affected by these changes will be able to claim jobseeker's allowance or supplementary welfare allowance subject to satisfying a means test. The maximum rate of these two schemes is paid at the same rate as jobseeker's benefit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Self-employed people may apply for jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Means of a self-employed person are assessed having regard to previous earnings, the persons current earnings and the prevailing business environment, and likely level of income of the person in the coming 12 months.Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures in these cases are applied in a flexible manner and they ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. Issues taken into account include the loss of a contract or the likelihood of finding a replacement contract.Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary the estimated earnings.  Means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.If a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the assessment of future income. It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for Jobseeker's Allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.  In addition it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17, 23, 24, 29, 33, 45, 50 and 71 together.Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up. Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.There are currently 1,355 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard. It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefits pension scheme are in deficit. However, the full extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.The Government is very conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last year. We are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.The Government is continuing to consider the issues in relation to both the maintenance of the funding standard and the wider issue of future security of the supplementary pensions sector.Indeed, we recently implemented a number of short-term measures to ease the pressures currently being felt by many pension funds. Those measures include—The granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals.Granting flexibility to the Pensions Board to allow longer periods (over 10 years) for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances;Enabling the Board to allow the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan in certain circumstances; andEnabling the Board to take into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans.To ensure that these concessions are not seen as a weakening of supervision arrangements, the Pensions Board will not accept recovery plans which do not demonstrate an appropriate investment approach.I believe that these measures will help all schemes currently in difficulty and will help to ensure the best outcomes for the scheme members themselves.

As outlined in Budget 2009, the Government, following a review of the decentralisation programme, in light of the changed economic circumstances and the deterioration in public finances, agreed a revised schedule for the programme.  In prioritising projects, a number of factors had to be taken into consideration, including issues such as sites purchased and commitments already made, costs involved and the expectations of staff already assigned to decentralising posts.The Office of Public works is charged with securing accommodation for this Department's decentralisation programme and have advised that they have not purchased a site in Donegal Town.The remaining elements of the programme have been deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of the budgetary developments.  The position in respect of relocation to Donegal Town will be reviewed at that time.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 22, 28, 38 and 72 together.With the increase in the number of people applying for jobseeker's payments staff in local offices have been working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.Productivity has increased significantly. Nearly 155,000 claims were processed in Local Offices in the last quarter of 2008 (including the One Family Payment). This compares with less than 89,000 in the last quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 74%.I know that processing times in some areas are still too long and I assure Deputies that we are doing our best to reduce them. I appreciate that becoming unemployed is a very difficult time in a persons life and that they need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.The average time for applications processed in January was 2 weeks for jobseeker's benefit claims and 5 weeks for jobseeker's allowance claims.The Deputies will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker's payment can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.A table showing the time taken, in weeks, to process jobseeker's Allowance and jobseeker's Benefit claims in each of the months October, November, December and January is as follows.OfficeOct

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 54 and 75 together.The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) schemes are administered by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The operational arrangements for processing of applications and payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.The administration costs of the SWA and BSCFA schemes are met by the Department. Funding for salaries of community welfare officers is based on the proportion of time they spend administering these schemes. This can range from 50% to 100 % throughout the country. Funding is provided centrally to the HSE which is responsible for the allocation of budgets to individual community welfare divisions.In 2008 the department paid the HSE €58.3m in administration costs. This was based on the cost of salaries in 2007 plus a Department of Finance pay inflator of 3.74%. The Department funds 636 community welfare officer posts, 58 superintendent community welfare officer posts as well as 172 additional support staff.The issue of increased demand on existing resources is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise workloads and re-deploy resources where necessary so that frontline services are maintained. The HSE is currently reviewing the allocation of staff currently engaged in the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and associated income support payments. The Department is committed to working closely with the HSE in ensuring effective delivery of services and any request by the HSE for an additional staffing allocation will be given due consideration. However, the question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided, would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.Extra staff have been assigned to the Department's social welfare local offices and process improvement initiatives are being implemented with a view to reducing processing times for jobseeker's claims. These measures should help to relieve some of the pressure on the Community Welfare Service.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The Green Paper on pensions was published in October 2007 and this was followed by a lengthy consultation process which concluded at the end of May 2008.  The consultation was very successful as it showed that there is a great demand for pensions reform.  Unfortunately, there was little consensus on the type of reform required. The views expressed ranged from a continuation of the existing voluntary arrangement to a State run earnings-related pension system operated through the PRSI system.The Government is faced with difficult decisions in this area.  A good pensions system is costly no matter how it is organised. The challenge faced by Government is to strike the appropriate balance between those involved, including employers, people in employment and the State.  Recent market difficulties have also highlighted issues in relation to security of pensions and this must also be considered in the development of our long-term approach.Our objective is to ensure that the pension system will deliver an adequate retirement income for all and at the same time will be affordable and sustainable for the State and for those who sponsor and provide occupational pensions systems.It had been hoped to finalise our approach on all aspects of the pensions system by the end of 2008 but this did not prove possible.  Discussions with my Government colleagues on the final framework are on-going, and I expect that it will be ready for publication shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The statutory basis for the introduction of a personal advocacy service under the Citizens Information Board (CIB) was provided for in the Citizens Information Act, 2007.   However, having regard to the current budgetary circumstances, it will not be possible to proceed with this in 2009.Significant resources have been provided since 2005 for a personal advocacy service.  These will continue to be made available under the auspices of the Citizens Information Board for the development and provision of advocacy services for people with disabilities.The Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme has been developed by the Board since 2005 and has funded 46 separate advocacy projects.  The overall focus of the programme is on representative advocacy for people with a disability.  Projects either operate within a specific geographic area or are focused on a particular disability type.  Each of the projects possess different challenges, some requiring more intensive work with smaller caseloads while others have larger caseloads with shorter periods of client contact. Up to the end of 2008 some, 3,400 members of the public have availed of the services provided by the projects.The Citizens Information Board monitors the programme to ensure that the projects are operating in accordance with the Board's advocacy guidelines.  It is planned to undertake a full evaluation of the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme in 2010.The Citizens Information Board also provides advocacy through the Citizens Information Services focusing on access to services, welfare entitlements and employment rights. This type of mainstream advocacy is also open to people with disabilities and the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme is creating close links with the Citizens Information Services to ensure that people with disabilities are encouraged and supported to use the mainstream services where possible.  The advocacy capacity is being strengthened through the provision of Advocacy Resource Officers who work to build the capacity of information providers within the Citizens Information Services to advocate on behalf of clients.  There are nine Advocacy Resource Officers in operation across the Citizens Information Services network.I am satisfied with the developments undertaken to provide advocacy services for people with disabilities through the Citizens Information Board.  The Department will continue to work with them to further enhance advocacy services for all citizens including those with disabilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 40 together.Jobseeker's Allowance or Benefit are normally payable when persons lose their employment however the jobseeker's' system is flexible and can respond to many persons who suffer a reduction in days employed or who can only find part-time work. People who find themselves in such circumstances may in fact be paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of days not worked.To be paid jobseeker's payments for any week, there must be 3 days of unemployment in that week or a person must be in a systematic short-time work situation such as one week on followed by a week off.These various arrangements currently support some 44,000 casual and part-time workers who are not able to find full-time work, or who have suffered a reduction in working days, within the social welfare system at present.In addition the Department of Social and Family Affairs provides a range of employment supports designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force. Included in these measures is the back to work allowance (BTWA). The BTWA scheme is designed to assist the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to work.There are two strands to the scheme; the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for the self-employed and the back to work allowance (BTWA) for employees. Participants receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a three year period for employees and a four year period for those who become self employed. Participants may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits. These allowances provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependant long-term on social welfare payments to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.To qualify for the back to work allowance an application must be submitted in advance and the person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specific length of time immediately prior to commencing employment or self employment.The department also operates an in-work payment to low paid workers through the family income supplement (FIS). The scheme is designed to provide support for people, with families, who are on low earnings. This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might be only marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of FIS is that the customer must be in paid employment of at least 38 hours every fortnight or 19 hours per week. This condition must be satisfied on an ongoing basis. Application forms are available forms are available on-line at www.welfare.ie or through local Social Welfare Offices or through the Department's local leaflet request line.The Department of Social and Family Affairs does not operate any other in work support or top up scheme for jobseeker's. The schemes of the department will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	305	During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work to develop a national carers strategy. Unfortunately, in the current economic climate it is not possible to consider introducing any developments in services for carers at this time.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which does not include any significant plans for the future, the Government has decided not to publish a strategy at this time.The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by the many people who care for others and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.  Over the past decade weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.I appreciate that it is disappointing for carers and the people for whom they care that we are not in a position to publish a strategy at this time.  I met with some of their representatives earlier this week to inform them of this difficult decision taken by Government.I also wanted to acknowledge all those who took the time to make submissions as part of the public consultation process and to assure them that those submissions were considered in detail by the working group and will inform our thinking in the future.   The Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children, including the Health Service Executive, are committed to working with the carer representative groups to deliver services in a more effective way to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in supporting carers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Social welfare payments are provided for by voted expenditure from the exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.  In the current economic climate the Government recognises that we must do all we can to support people who become unemployed.  Social welfare payments are a crucial part of this support, but income support alone is not sufficient.  We must also do all we can to help get people back to work.FÁS is the National Training and Employment Authority and the main agency to provide jobseeking support to all individuals on the live register who are seeking employment or education opportunities.  Currently, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them enter/re-enter the labour market.  In addition there are a range of other education and employment supports available to persons in receipt of welfare payments.  These initiatives are designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.  Included in these measures is the back to work allowance and back to education allowance.The Department of Social and Family Affairs facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at national and local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities for social welfare recipients to assist them return to the workforce.Senior officials of the department meet with FÁS, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the social and economic progression of those most marginalised is being adequately addressed.  I am satisfied that a high degree of cooperation and coordination exists at both policy and operational level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 35 together.The Deputy will be aware that there has been a very significant increase in the number of people applying for a jobseeker's payment during the past year. From February 2008 to February 2009 the Live Register increased by about 165,000 people, or over 87%.Staff in social welfare local offices are working extremely hard and productivity increased by 74% between the last quarter of 2007 and the final quarter of 2008.  190 extra staff are also being put in place in local offices to minimise delays in claim processing. These include —  31 extra staff assigned to local offices; 115 additional staff identified as necessary as part of a staffing review carried out in October 2008; 32 temporary staff assigned from 2nd March to the 17 local offices with the highest volumes of claims on hands; and 12 extra staff as identified in a separate staffing exercise for Cork Local office.As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, a further 40 staff are being assigned to central decisions units. 16 Social Welfare Inspectors are also being assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseeker's allowance. In addition to these 246 staff, the number of facilitators has also been increased from 40 to 60.Measures have also been taken to improve the processes used in processing claims.  These include—The introduction of a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years;The testing of an improved procedure for claimants moving from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's to jobseeker's allowance which we plan to extend to all offices later this month;Online availability of application forms for the jobseeker schemes; andThe use of an appointment system for taking claims in some offices which we intend to roll out to other areas over the coming months.I fully appreciate that becoming unemployed and having to claim a jobseeker's payment is stressful enough in itself. By introducing these initiatives I am trying to ensure that the process is as easy as it possibly can be. I know that processing times in some areas are still too long and I assure Deputies that the necessary steps are being taken to reduce them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Income chargeable to PRSI is, in general, defined in terms of income liable under Schedule E of the Income Tax Acts. Such income is generally derived from employment or self-employment.This income base is appropriate to the social insurance system as it is consistent with the contributory principle of the of the social insurance fund, whereby a relationship is established between the employment or self-employment status and the rate of contribution payable and benefits or pensions receivable as a result of these contributions.In common with many social insurance systems throughout the world, the system is not actuarially based but funded through a pay-as-you-go approach. Today's contributors support both past and current contributors while also ensuring their own future security by building up entitlement to later benefits and pensions and paying into a mechanism that redistributes income over one's own lifetime.The range of income which is subject to PRSI is reviewed on a regular basis. Most recently in 2004 the exemption of non pecuniary emoluments from the charge to PRSI was removed. As a consequence, subject to certain exemptions, benefits in kind are now subject to PRSI.Any further revision of the PRSI base would be a matter for consideration by Government in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Full social insurance cover was extended to part-time workers from April 1991. At that time a range of measures were introduced to ensure that the rate of Illness Benefit and jobseeker's Benefit payable would be proportionate to the persons income and PRSI contributions. They were also intended to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created. In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments in excess of their income from employment.These measures are regularly updated to keep pace with rises in benefit levels. Budget 2003 sought to bring the income threshold and banding structure back into line with the level of benefits payable. However, with the increases in benefits that have been provided since then, these thresholds and related bands had again gone seriously out of line with the associated rates of benefit. For example, an employee who earned €150.00 per week in 2004 qualified for a personal rate of payment of €134.80. In 2008, this payment had increased to €197.80 for the same level of earnings. At these levels, the weekly income threshold and graduated Illness and Jobseeker's Benefit rates represented a serious disincentive to employment.The new thresholds that were introduced in January will address these disincentive effects by completing the process of bringing the income thresholds and banding structure back into line with the benefits payable.A person in receipt of a reduced rate Illness or Jobseeker's Benefit payment which is insufficient to meet their needs, may, be eligible for a top-up under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme subject to a means test. Recipients of Jobseeker's Benefit may opt to transfer to means tested Jobseeker's Allowance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Becoming unemployed and having to claiming a jobseeker's payment is extremely difficult for people.  I am trying to ensure that the process of claiming is made as easy as it possibly can be.  Therefore during 2008 we commenced a review of our processes and procedures surrounding the claim-taking and decisions process.  To date the following initiatives have been introduced:A new streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years has been implemented in all local and branch offices.More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced in all offices.A simplified procedure and process for people moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseeker's benefit expires is currently being trialled and will be extended to all offices later this month.In addition, we have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in some offices and plan to extend this to other local offices in the coming months.  Another initiative developed and trialled involved Deciding Officers meeting certain categories of customer by appointment and taking and deciding claims on the day.  It has not yet proved possible to extend this initiative to other offices.Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times.In addition, we are reviewing the processes involved in administering claims for those who are working reduced hours i.e. part-time, casual and systematic short time. This is a very labour intensive and manual system which we are looking to simplify over the coming months.Further such initiatives are under consideration and will be developed by the Department over the coming months.

Under the terms of their contract, branch managers are required to review their staffing levels to ensure that they allow for the efficient performance of the work of the office.The additional number of people applying for jobseeker payments has placed increased pressure on all of the Department's local and branch offices.  All claims taken in branch offices are forwarded to the parent local office for decision by a deciding officer.Where the parent local office is under particular pressure arising from the extra workload from the increase in its live register, this can contribute to the delays in processing branch office claims.   Staff in social welfare local and branch offices are working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.I appreciate that people need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.  The situation regarding applications for jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance in both local and branch offices is being monitored on an on-going basis by the Department to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to ensure claims are processed as speedily as possible.As part of the allocation of additional staff to local offices, 107 staff have been allocated to offices with responsibility for branch offices to assist in processing claims taken in these offices as quickly as possible. The staff levels in these offices are being kept under review.Statistics are not maintained on the number of staff employed by branch managers.   It should be noted, however, that a branch manager's annual performance assessment, which is conducted by the management from the parent local office, involves an evaluation of the staffing levels to ensure that service requirements are being met.

Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. The occupational injuries scheme, operated by the Department, provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease. In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.If the incapacity extends beyond the 26 week period, claimants may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme. Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with the norm for a person of the same age and gender.

By late February 83 of these staff were in place and start dates have been agreed for a further 12 in early March.In addition to this a separate staffing review was undertaken in Cork local office resulting in the allocation of 12 extra staff.As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, we have decided to set up a number of central decision units around the country.  Four such units are currently being set up in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas and Carrick-on-Shannon. Each unit will have 10 staff and the Department expects that all of these staff will be in place within the next few weeks.  Work has recently commenced on setting up a further unit in Roscommon and this unit should be operational within the next two months or so.A number of offices have a particularly high volume of claims awaiting a decision.  In order to deal with this, 32 additional temporary staff were recruited with effect from 2 March to support these offices.A further 16 Social Welfare Inspectors are being assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseeker's allowance.  This brings the total additional staff being assigned to 246.There is a significant training overhead associated with staff coming into local offices due to the complex nature of the jobseeker's schemes.  This is particularly so when a person is coming from another Department and may not have any Social Welfare background whatsoever.  While a certain amount of formal training is provided, the bulk of the training is "on-the-job".  It takes many months for a deciding officer to get up to speed with all the various aspects of the schemes administered in local offices.  In the meantime they  rely on assistance from their more experienced colleagues to guide them in the learning process.  Consequently, there is a certain amount of lost productivity while new staff acquire the necessary expertise of experienced Deciding Officers.It is also recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself will not deal with the rising claim load.  Since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.  Examples of process improvement initiatives introduced recently include:A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 yearsApplication forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times.More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introducedWe will shortly be introducing a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseeker's benefit expires.We have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in some offices and plan to extend this to other offices over the coming months.Becoming unemployed and having to claim a jobseeker's payment is a difficult time for people.  By introducing these initiatives I am trying to ensure that the process is as easy as it possibly can be for people.I am satisfied that the range of measures I have outlined are sufficient to ensure that, in time, all claims for jobseeker's payments will be processed without undue delay.  In this context I would point out that, taking account of the processes involved in determining entitlement to jobseeker's allowance, including the assessment of means which may involve a home visit, it would not be possible to process such claims within one week as suggested by the Deputy.

This allocation was increased during the course of the year, however, and the overall expenditure in the regions in 2008 was €1.739m.It is not possible to say what expenditure was incurred exclusively in the processing of jobseeker claims.  However during the past year the vast majority of overtime would have been used for this purpose.The overtime allocation for 2009 is €1,700,000 and this budget will be reviewed as the need arises.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I understand that the Deputy is concerned in particular about the current arrangements applying in the case of old age pension where a landholder leases land or is otherwise in possession of land which is fallow or idle.In 2006 the State pension (non-contributory) replaced a range of non-contributory payments for persons aged 66 and over including the old age pension. A wide range of important reforms were announced for non-contributory pensioners, including farmers, in conjunction with the introduction of the new pension. These impacted on farmer pensioners generally including farmers who have let land or are considering leasing their land. All the schemes replaced, featured a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which had not increased since the 1970s. This general disregard was increased to €20 with effect from September 2006 and was subsequently increased to €30 with effect from January 2007. This means that the first €30 per week of all means, including any means from the letting of land, is not taken into account.Any further improvements to the means testing arrangements for the (non-contributory) state pension would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and having regard to available resources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 62 together.The school meals programme gives funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department of Social & Family Affairs.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly by the Department to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.The Department has received one allegation in relation to the operation of the School Meals programme and this allegation is currently being investigated.  The Department does not comment on individual allegations of fraud or abuse until there has been a successful prosecution in the courts.Under the School Meals scheme, the Department funds schools and school-based community organisations in respect of food costs only, subject to various conditions. The decision to operate a school food project or to apply for funding under the school meals local projects scheme rests with the school itself.  Funding under the scheme is targeted at disadvantaged school children. The intention is to assist schools or groups who are operating their own school food projects, with the food costs of the project only.  Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school.Funding is issued on the basis of a rate per child, per meal, per day.  It is the responsibility of the school or project to ensure that food is purchased only for children in attendance.  All schools or projects have to submit financial returns to the Department which detail the numbers and types of meals provided and the numbers of children benefiting. These returns are backed up by receipts for food costs incurred.School principals making returns have to certify the number of meals provided and the number of pupils benefiting.  This is to ensure that all funding is used for the purpose for which it is intended.  Officials of the Department make visits to a number of participating schools throughout the year as a control measure.The Department of Education and Science has indicated that there are currently 875 schools in its programme for disadvantaged schools —  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools).   Pupils from 730 DEIS schools (83% of  DEIS schools) are benefiting under the school meals local projects scheme.The number of meals provided under the urban and Local Projects Schemes has more than doubled from 89,915 in the 2005/2006 school year to 220,961 in the school year 2007/2008.  In providing meals to this number of pupils, the scheme is a direct intervention in supporting disadvantaged children.

There are currently nearly 80,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 34% since the end of December 2007.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.The maximum rent which a person may incur and still qualify for rent supplement is prescribed in regulations. These regulations are time limited so that they can be adjusted in light of rent levels generally and the wider economic climate.  Regulations which covered the period 1st January 2007 to 30th June 2008 were reviewed in mid 2008 and the existing rent limits were extended to 31 December 2009, subject to review in early 2009.Rent limits are currently being reviewed in the light of reductions in rent levels in 2008. In testing the level at which basic accommodation can be secured, the Department is informed by analysis of data on rent supplement tenancies, data provided by the Private Residential Tenancies Board on tenancies registered by them and submissions by interested statutory and non statutory bodies including the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The review will also be informed by the latest Private Rented Index report to be published by the CSO in mid March 2009.  Estimates of expenditure on the rent supplement scheme in 2009 will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the rent limits review.The rent limits prescribed in regulations are maximum limits.  The Health Service Executive has flexibility to award rent supplement above or below rent limits, having regard to local rent levels or to meet the particular needs of an individual.  These discretionary powers ensure that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.

It is in recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market.The back to education allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  It encourages and facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.  In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.In order to support activation of unemployed people, the qualifying period for access to the third level option has been reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process, where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual's employment prospects.In addition people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the back to education scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.The back to education scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market.  The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.  Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments —  these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.  Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.

A means-tested widow's or widower's non-contributory pension may be payable to those who do not satisfy the social insurance conditions.  If the person has qualified children, they may instead qualify for the means-tested one-parent family payment. A key condition for receipt of the widow's or widower's pension is that the person is the surviving partner of a married couple.The Department is carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended).  This will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination on any of the nine grounds of the Act, including gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status.  Where any instances of discrimination are identified, it will examine whether they are objectively justified by a legitimate policy aim and whether the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.The Government is also planning legislation in the area of civil partnership.  The provisions in relation to widow's and widower's pensions will be reviewed in the light of this legislation when it is enacted and when the equality review is finalised.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 65 together.The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings.  This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.The extent to which a worker may avail of the Family Income Supplement is dependent on the following conditions being met:Person is in full-time employment which is expected to last for at least 3 monthsWorks at least 19 hours weekly or 38 hours every fortnightHas at least one qualified child who normally resides with the applicant and/or is supported by the applicantWhose average weekly family income is below a specified amount, which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.An integral feature of the scheme is that, once the level of the FIS payment is  determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment.  However, the rate of payment can be increased where an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the child(ren). Net income for FIS purposes comprises total family income less tax, employee PRSI, health contribution, income levy and superannuation contribution. In addition the recently introduced pension levy will also be deductible from income when calculating the eligibility to FIS.The pension levy deduction will apply to public sector employees, who are members of a public service pension scheme, and all income earned after 1st March 2009 will be subject to the deduction. This will give rise to a  reduction in net income of public servants. This reduction in net income is likely to impact on (i) public service workers who are currently FIS recipients and (ii) public service workers, who heretofore failed to apply or qualify for FIS due to income slightly above the FIS earnings thresholds but who now may qualify for FIS in light of the introduction of the pension levy.A previous manual random sample analysis estimated that approximately 10% of FIS claims relate to those working in the public service. However, current data on those who may now qualify for FIS is unavailable. The absence of this data  coupled with factors such as rising levels of remuneration e.g. incremental wage increases of workers impacting on possible entitlement, a reduction in the number of qualified children, which may disqualify a potential FIS recipient, together with any possible uptake of or indeed return from any work sharing/family friendly arrangements, renders it difficult to quantify with any precision any likely increase in FIS claims due to the introduction of the pension levy on public servants.The department currently undertakes a number of measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to Family Income (FIS). These include advice to all persons who are awarded a one parent family payment and back to work recipients. Furthermore an extensive advertising campaign for FIS was conducted in 2006. Information on FIS is also published on the Department's website and made available through the Citizen's Information Service.To help establish the best ways of promoting FIS going forward, the department commissioned a research project in 2008 to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  The research found that overall awareness of Family Income Supplement among potential recipients is high with nearly three in four claiming to have heard of the scheme.  Despite high levels of awareness, there was a lack of awareness and understanding of the eligibility requirements with only one in three claiming to be aware of the qualifying criteria for FIS.The report recommends that the Department needs to ensure that information about the scheme is advertised in a focused way with the eligibility and qualification criteria communicated as clearly as possible. The Department is addressing this by ensuring such information is highlighted as part of its ongoing publicity and advertisement campaigns.

On foot of a High Court judgement, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law. As such, the High Court judgement is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act. The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on.  As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment in detail at this time, other than to say that I am keeping the matter under review.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that Section 5(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a declaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the existing law relating to civil registration.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The vast bulk of expenditure by the Department of Social and Family Affairs is incurred on social welfare payments to individual recipients based on predetermined qualifying conditions and rates of payment. The expenditure, which is demand-led, is driven by a range of economic, social and demographic factors. There can also be complex interactions between schemes.The Estimates for the Department of Social and Family Affairs which were published with the 2009 Budget were based, in the main, on an analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2009. The estimates for jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance were based on the Department of Finance's prediction of an average Live Register of 290,000 for the year.  Developments on the Live Register are being closely monitored by both Departments and the estimate for jobseeker's benefit and allowance will be reconsidered again in the context of the finalisation of the Revised Estimates Volume.  Determination of the average Live Register figure to underpin the Estimate is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.The procedures and processes associated with claims for jobseeker payments are necessary to ensure that the right payment is paid to the right person at the right rate. However these can be off-putting to those who now find themselves unemployed after possibly a lifetime of employment. Our procedures and processes are being reviewed and a number of process improvement initiatives are being implemented.  Self-employed people may apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.Means are taken as any net profit that a person will earn in the coming 12 months. While income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year. Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for Jobseeker's Allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances. In addition it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office.In May 2008 an additional 31 staff were assigned to local offices to deal with the increased volume of claims all of these staff are in place.Following on from this, a further staffing review was undertaken in October and an additional 115 were allocated. By late February 83 of these staff were in place and start dates have been agreed for a further 12 in early March.In addition to this a separate staffing review was undertaken in Cork local office resulting in the allocation of 12 extra staff.As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, we have decided to set up a number of central decision units around the country.

The allowance which has been increased by €2 to €20 (€23.90 in designated smokeless zones) per week from January 2009 benefits almost 300,000 households and represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. The duration of payment has also been extended by 2 weeks from April 2009 bringing the total period for which fuel allowance is paid to 32 weeks. A detailed review of the fuel allowance scheme was carried out in 1998.  This review looked at alternatives to the weekly method payment method including a single lump sum payment. A survey of recipients with the allowance, carried out in conjunction with the review, showed that the majority favoured weekly payments. The review recommended continuing with the weekly payment method.While the payment of fuel allowance in lump sums could be advantageous for some people, there would also be disadvantages.  The lump sum payment might not be used for the purpose of fuel purchase leading to hardship at a later stage and recourse having to be made to supplementary welfare allowance payments.  A person's circumstances could change, leading to disqualification from payment of fuel allowance resulting in an overpayment having to be refunded.  Payment of a lump sum in arrears would not be a viable option for persons with immediate needs during the winter period.  Many oil companies provide facilities for making payment by instalment over a period of time which allows people to plan and budget for fuel expenses.The Department is examining alternatives to the weekly method payment method including lump sum payments and as part of this process interested persons and agencies will be consulted.  A number of issues need to be considered in detail including the administrative costs and processes involved in any changes to the current method of paying fuel allowance on a weekly basis.  When all issues have been examined, a decision can be made in the best interests of all fuel allowance recipients.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The primary purpose of credited contributions is to preserve the continuity of a person's insurance record during periods when they are unable to work and pay PRSI in the normal way. In order to qualify for credited contributions, absences from work would generally have to be for reasons outside of the person's control, such as periods of proven illness or registered unemployment, or periods during which they may be entitled to certain other social welfare payments.Credited contributions are not generally available in circumstances where a person voluntarily ceases insurable employment on a temporary or permanent basis. This reflects the contributory principle that underpins the qualifying conditions for all social insurance payments. However, a person taking time off work to care for children up to 12 years of age, or an incapacitated adult, may be entitled to avail of the homemaker's scheme whereby such periods can be taken into account for state contributory pension purposes at age 66.One of the qualifying conditions for contributory pensions requires that the applicant must have a minimum yearly average number of paid or credited contributions throughout their working lives. Therefore, any prolonged gaps in insurance cover are likely to have significant consequences with regard to pension entitlement.In the case of short-term benefits such as job-seekers allowance, illness, and treatment benefits a person may retain entitlement to such payments for a limited period after their last PRSI contribution but entitlement would then lapse unless further reckonable contributions are recorded on their behalf.Subject to certain statutory conditions, it may be open to a person on a career break to pay voluntary contributions. However, it should be noted that voluntary contributions are reckonable only for state contributory pension, transition pension and widows/widowers contributory pension.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The back to work scheme was introduced to assist long term unemployed people, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients to return to active employment either by taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  It is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work allowance (BTWA) for persons who take up employment and the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for persons who become self employed.To qualify for the back to work enterprise allowance a person must set up a self-employment business that has been approved by a Partnership Company or a department's facilitator and, in the case of someone on the live register, they must be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for 2 years prior to commencing their self employment.  Participants on the back to work enterprise allowance receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a four year period.  Participants may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.  At 20th Feb 2009, there were 7,727 participants availing of the back to work scheme and, of these, 4,430 were participating in the self-employed option.The operation of the scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.

Jobseeker's Benefit is based on a person's social insurance record Jobseeker's Allowance is based on weekly means. A fundamental qualifying condition for Jobseeker's Benefit is that an individual must be available for full time work.However, a person who engages in voluntary work within the State may continue to be entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.Examples of voluntary work in which jobseeker's may engage include:helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disabilityassisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associationsThe groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups.  The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely —  to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseeker's to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseeker's of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.Individuals or organisations looking to avail of the option may request a VW 1 form from any social welfare local office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I have no plans to introduce a system to refund the cost of taxis under the free travel scheme.The free travel scheme provides pass holders with free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as LUAS and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas, including those in the Rural Transport Initiative.   Time restrictions, which had applied to the use of the travel pass were lifted in 2006.  One of the principal reasons for lifting the restriction was to enable people to use their free travel pass to attend for early hospital appointments.Various alternatives to the existing system have been examined. A study, "A Review of the Free Schemes", published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher or refund type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.  This position remains unchanged.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.With over 31,000 people in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more, the rent supplement scheme has to be seen in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) was introduced in 2004 and is being implemented on a phased basis. RAS gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Since 2005, over 18,000 rent supplement recipients have been transferred to RAS units and other social housing options. The expectation is, that over time, costs arising from the transfer of rent supplement recipients to RAS will be exchequer neutral.  The number of rent supplement cases transferred to RAS for the past three years is set out in the tabular statement.YearVoluntary TransfersPrivate TransfersSocial Housing TransfersTotal20061,5058282,1134,44620078412,0773,1266,04420086333,0123,2706,915Total2,9795,9178,50917,405

The value of rent supplement payments nominated by tenants to be paid directly to landlords living abroad, represents just over 0.25% of all rent supplement payments.The Department provides the Revenue Commissioners with details of non-resident landlords who have rent supplement payments paid directly to them, in order that compliance with tax legislation can be monitored by the Revenue Commissioners. However, currently it does not have the facilities to withhold tax in these cases and development of a tax deduction system would prove very costly.The Department of Finance has initiated a review of the statutory requirement on tenants to make deductions from rent paid direct to landlords living abroad.  This review is expected to be completed shortly.  The Department will examine the position regarding this issue following the completion of the review.In the meantime the Department continues to work with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that any tax risks relating to landlords with rent supplemented tenancies are kept to a minimum.

Under the Act a permit must be applied for within 60 days of a job being offered or advertised.In the event that an employment permit is issued taking into account the current policy at the time, then the non-EEA national is generally expected to take up employment from the start date of the permit or as soon as a visa is granted in the case of visa required non-EEA nationals.If there are any changes to the conditions of the permit or if the employee does not take up the job being offered at that time, then the original and the certified copy of the permit must be returned to my Department.

A permit was issued on foot of this application on 25/2/2008 and was valid for the period 3/3/2008 to 2/3/2010.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform subsequently issued an entry visa enabling this person to take up employment in the State.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The position in relation to the person mentioned has not changed since the Deputy raised the issue on 5 February last.Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer.  In general, a redundancy situation exists where an employee's job no longer exists.  It is up to the employer concerned to determine whether or not there is in fact a redundancy situation.  Disputes in this regard can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.  It should be noted that an employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing his employment.  This matter has been examined by the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department and no records currently exist in respect of an application for statutory redundancy for the person concerned.This individual may be entitled to claim a redundancy lump sum in the event of lay off.  A lay off situation is intended to cover temporary situations where the services of an employee are not required because of lack of work and the employer gives notice that the break in employment is of a temporary nature.  If the lay-off continues, the question arises as to whether it is in fact a temporary measure or could potentially be a redundancy rather than a lay-off situation.  It is the employer who initially decides whether or not there is a redundancy situation but in the case of a dispute, the matter should be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision.The employee is entitled, after a period of lay-off of four consecutive weeks or a broken series of six weeks within a 13-week period, and, subject to meeting the normal eligibility criteria for redundancy, to seek statutory redundancy.  The employee can, by serving written notice (Form RP 9) on the employer claim redundancy because of the lay-off situation.  Notice must be submitted not later than four weeks after the lay-off ceases.  A copy of the RP 9 form may be had from my Department or may be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.In this situation, an employer has a period of seven days within which to provide a counter-notice to the employee to the effect that within four weeks of the date of the claim for redundancy, it will be possible to offer not less than 13 weeks work without lay off.

In general most contract staff in the public service are now eligible for pension scheme membership. In addition, a person who is on a contract and, for example, is in receipt of a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme, would be liable for the deduction.  In terms of assessing whether there is a payment in lieu of membership of a scheme etc, this would have to be examined by whoever approved the contract terms.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Under the general scheme of corporation tax provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, corporation tax is charged on the profits of a company arising in a financial year but the tax is assessed on the company by reference to accounting periods.  The starting point for determining a company's taxable profits and liability to corporation tax is, therefore, the company's profits for the relevant accounting period as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards.  Section 27 of the Act provides that for corporation tax purposes an accounting period may not be longer than 12 months duration.  The fact that companies' accounting periods differ as regards length and timing does not affect the charge, assessment, collection and recovery of corporation tax.  It is difficult, from a tax point of view then, to see what benefit would arise from introducing a standardised tax and accounting year for companies.There are various business, financial, company law and administration issues which a company must take into consideration in setting its accounting period.  Many companies are members of groups and their accounting periods are aligned with those of the parent company and other members of the group, some of which may reside in overseas jurisdictions.  In the circumstances, it is likely that the introduction of a standardised tax and accounting year for all companies would be unduly restrictive and would impose unnecessary administrative burdens on companies who, as a consequence of the measure put forward by the Deputy, may be required to change their accounting year or provide more than one set of audited accounts.

The maximum lump sum benefit that can be achieved at normal retirement age by an employee is one and a half times final remuneration.  This arrangement is available under pension schemes in both the public and private sectors.  For certain individuals, a tax-free lump sum calculated on the basis of 25% of their pension fund is allowable on retirement, as an alternative to the lump sum calculated on the basis of final remuneration.  I have no plans at this point in time to alter the tax treatment of retirement lump sum payments.

The Health Service Executive can pay an approved subvention to the nursing home of the applicants' choice and the payment of the balance of the nursing home fee is a matter between the applicant and the nursing home under the contract of care agreed between these parties.The existing subvention scheme is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007.  Under the Act, the maximum amount for basic subvention is €300 per week.  The Act also provides for an enhanced subvention to be paid.  However, there is no maximum amount set for enhanced subvention.  The amount paid is at the discretion of the HSE and will vary depending on the following criteria:the assessed means of the applicant,the cost of care in the individual case compared to the level of fees in the locality,the amount of basic subvention payable,the amount of resources available for the scheme,the need for the HSE to ensure that the available resources are distributed in a way that supports applicants as evenly as  possible across the country.Therefore, this is a service matter and it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

I am aware that there are currently two services in the Ballaghaderreen area that are in the final stages of the appraisal process and that these services will be notified of the outcome in the coming weeks.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The Child Care Act 1991 provides for the making of Regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of pre-school children attending pre-school services.  The Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 came into effect in 2007 and currently govern the provision of pre-school services.A pre-school service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of pre-school children, including the childminder's children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours a day is regarded as a childminding service for the purposes of the Child Care Regulations.  In general, where more than three children are being taken care of, the childminder is required to notify his or her service to the HSE and is subject to the Regulations and to inspection.The National Guidelines for childminders have also been published to support childcare providers who choose to mind children in their own home.  A copy of these Guidelines and also the Regulations can be obtained from the Government Publications Sales Office or from the Childcare Directorate in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

The principal focus of the new Bill will be on ensuring good governance of property management companies and similar bodies which comprise the owners of individual units within multi-unit developments and which exercise management functions in relation to such developments. It is also intended to include provisions for the resolution of disputes arising in relation to such matters. The policy aspects extend to my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The aim is to publish the Bill in the next Session.Policy in the law generally on fire safety is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  However, the information from that Department is that Part B of the Building Regulations 1997 —  2008 already sets out the fire safety requirements to be observed in the design and construction of multi-unit developments.  Where a local authority is satisfied that the building design is in accordance with the requirements of the Building Control Regulations, it will issue a Fire Safety Certificate in respect of the design.  Moreover, the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 empower fire authorities to inspect multi-unit developments and to pursue enforcement of fire safety matters, including the management of fire safety.  The Act of 1981 places a duty on persons having control over premises, such as multi-unit developments, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.

The CSO took over responsibility for the compilation and publications of these statistics in the third quarter of 2006.I understand from the CSO that key considerations in the production of official statistics are to protect confidentiality and to minimise the risk of disclosing information that might lead to an individual being identified. The production of statistics for very small geographical areas increases the risk of such disclosure. The CSO has given a commitment that Garda data supplied to it would be subject to the highest standards of protection and confidentiality and that they would not be disseminated, shown or communicated to any other person or body in a form that can be related to an identifiable person or undertaking.The CSO took the view that the Deputy's query related to sensitive information on criminal offences for a very small geographical area, to which the considerations set out above apply.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months but more complicated cases can at times take considerably more than the current average.I understand that the person concerned is a refugee and in accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.

These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens, and applications made on behalf of minors. In exceptional circumstances, I may expedite a decision on an application. There is nothing contained in the Deputy's Question that warrants taking the application out of chronological order and treating it expeditiously.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. There is a limit to the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

I regret that it is not feasible to easily identify the exact costs of all the various reports emanating from my Department and its many agencies. To begin that process would necessitate the reallocation of considerable time and resources which could not be justified in the circumstances.However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department's policy in relation to meeting its public information obligations, as set out in my previous reply, is geared to keeping costs to an absolute minimum.

It contains a special unit for 16 and 17 year olds, however in the longer term the Irish Youth justice Service will take responsibility for the detention facilities for all boys under 18 years of age.I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the average population of St. Patrick's Institution on an annual basis for the period 2002 to 2008 is as follows:YearAverage PopulationCommittals for the year20021791,15820031881,12220041971,300200518790920061871,08020071977562008*2101,044*Figures for 2008 are provisional only as the Annual Report 2008 has yet to be finalised.I am further informed that the average period of prisoner detention in St. Patrick's Institution is not available for the years 2002 to 2008. The collation of the information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. However, the Irish Prison Service Annual Reports provide a breakdown in relation to sentence length by age of offender. In 2007, the breakdown is as follows:<3 mths3 –  < 6 mths6 –  <12 mths1 –  <2 yrs2 –  <3 yrs3 –  5 yrs5 –  10 yrs10 + yrsLifeTotal165121703200039171820374131008418 –  <212851982328455492421930It should be noted that the above figures apply to sentenced offenders only, under 21 years of age that are detained throughout the prison estate, not just in St. Patrick's Institution.Education in prisons is delivered by way of a partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies from the community. Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and Public Library Services make the largest contribution to, and are the mainstay of, the Prison Education Service.The Department of Education and Science provided an allocation of 220 whole-time equivalent teachers to the prisons through the VECs in the academic year 2008/09. This enables education to be offered in all prisons, including some provision for the summer months and special teaching arrangements where prisoners are segregated. Currently there are 20 whole-time equivalent teachers appointed by the City of Dublin Vocational Committee to staff the Education Unit in St Patrick's Institution.  There are three sections within the school complex —  Junior School, Senior School and the Protection Unit. The Junior School, for students aged 16-17 years,  has six classrooms and the Senior School, for students aged 18-21 years, has twelve classrooms.  There are two classrooms in the Protection Unit. There is a wide range of subjects on offer to students and students may sit the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate.  FETAC courses are also offered in the School.The following table shows the involvement in education in St Patrick's Institution for the period 2002 to 2007 across all age profiles. A breakdown by age is not available.  Participation in education is counted as involvement in at least one structured class in a sample week.  However, most of those taking part in education do so on a daily basis, as may be gauged by the measure of "intensive participation".  Figures for 2008 are not readily available at this time, however I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it is available to me.YearParticipationPopulationPercentageIntensive participation*Percentage200211317963%8145%20038818747%5228%20049218749%5328%20059317453%4626%20069519349%4222%200711119956%8442%*Intensive participation = Involved in structured classes for 10 hours or more per week.Figures based on enrolment on a sample week in November of each year.

The below provides information relating to the annual average prisoner population and the annual cost per prisoner for each of the years in question.  The figure for 2008 is not yet available as the Appropriation Account has yet to be finalised.YearAverage PopulationCost per Prisoner€200217985,550200318882,300200419779,800200518790,700200618797,1002007197106,800The cost per prisoner is based on the overall operating costs in each year, i.e, the actual running costs, such as pay, light and heat, food, maintenance, small works, etc., and also includes certain fixed costs that arise irrespective of the number of prisoners in custody, e.g. staffing numbers, utilities, etc.  In addition, all headquarters and central service costs are allocated over the prison establishments for the purpose of calculating the cost per prisoner at each location.  Major capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation in the interest of facilitating comparison between individual institution costs.The increase in the annual cost per prisoner during the period 2004 to 2007 is due primarily to pay increases under the National Pay Agreements and an increase in staff numbers at St. Patrick's Institution from 181 in 2004 to 218 in 2007.  The increase in staffing relates in part to the opening of the Special School for 16 and 17 year olds at that Institution.  There was also significant investment in work and training facilities at St. Patrick's Institution, with new workshops being opened during the period.

Chief among these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services to meet the specific needs of prisoners. As the Deputy will appreciate these services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management and self-management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.Given the diverse range of services, the fact that prisoners engage across a number of services and the transitional nature of the prison population, it is not possible to provide precise statistics around prisoner participation.  However, I can advise the Deputy that every effort is made to encourage and get prisoners to engage with relevant services and participate in constructive activity.I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that almost all prisoners are involved with a number of services during their sentence and involvement with the range of facilities currently available in St. Patrick's Institution will continue to be fostered.

In making any such application the person concerned should note that the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.

Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purposes of having her asylum application examined there.  This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 10 January 2007.  This Order was subsequently served on the person concerned which placed a legal obligation on her to present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Thursday 18 January 2007, to make arrangements for her formal transfer to the United Kingdom.  The person concerned failed to ‘present' on this occasion and was therefore classified as having ‘evaded' her transfer.  The person concerned became illegally resident in the State at that time.The person concerned continued to evade her transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned.  At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having her asylum claims investigated.  As part of this process, the person concerned was invited to attend for interview at that Office at a designated date and time but she failed to attend. She did not offer any explanation for her non-attendance.  As a result, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status.  This recommendation was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 30 June 2008.  This communication also notified the person concerned that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2)(c) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), there was no appeal against this recommendation.Arising from the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 14 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned has not responded to my Department's letter dated 14 July 2008.The case of the person concerned now falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  This process will involve an examination of the case of the person concerned having regard to Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.The Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned has not notified my Department or produced any documentary evidence which might suggest that she is pregnant.

The Deputy did not indicate whether the children are Irish citizens or Angolan citizens.

The person concerned applied for asylum on 19 October 2005.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 May 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.By letter dated 3 January 2008, the person concerned was notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006. The person concerned did not submit such an application.Following consideration of the case of the person concerned, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed by the Minister in respect of the person concerned on 26 February 2008. This Order was formally served by registered post dated 11 March 2008.The person concerned instituted Judicial Review Proceedings on 7 April 2008 challenging the Deportation Order. The Judicial Review Proceedings were subsequently settled. Among the Terms of Settlement were provisions that the Deportation Order would be revoked and the person concerned would be enabled to submit fresh representations in support of an application for permission to remain in the State. The Deportation Order has since been revoked. The person concerned was invited to provide fresh representations under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.

The immigration case histories and up to date positions of the three persons concerned, a husband, wife and child, are almost identical.  Accordingly, for the purposes of the Deputy's Question, I will deal with the three cases as one.  The persons concerned applied for asylum on 2 July 2007.  Their applications were refused following consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were informed, by letter dated 18 February 2008 in the case of the first named person concerned and by letter dated 15 February 2008 in the cases of the second and third named persons concerned, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, they were notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The persons concerned submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of these applications, it was determined that the persons concerned were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The persons concerned were notified of these decisions by letters dated 15 October 2008.The case files of the persons concerned, including all representations submitted, will now be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When these considerations have been completed, the case files of the persons concerned are passed to me for decision.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The St Andrews Agreement of 2006 provided for a review to examine the efficiency and value for money of the North/South Implementation Bodies, including the North/South Language Body, of which Foras na Gaeilge is a part. The Agreement also provided for the review to examine the case for additional North/South Bodies and for additional areas of co-operation within the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) and to input into work on the identification of a suitable substitute for the proposed Lights Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.The North/South Ministerial Council agreed at its plenary meeting in July 2007 to set up a Review Group to take this work forward and to report back on it.  The review is ongoing. At the most recent plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in Derry on 23 January 2009, Ministers welcomed the progress made to date and requested the Review Group to consider, in consultation with the relevant sponsor Departments and Ministers, North and South, draft recommendations on the existing North/South Bodies and to submit a report on that aspect of the review to the next meeting of the NSMC plenary. That meeting is expected to take place in June of this year.The Council also requested the Review Group to complete work on its remaining terms of reference (the case for additional Bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC and the identification of a suitable substitute for the Irish Lights Agency) and to submit proposals to it by the end of 2009.  In these circumstances, I do not feel that it would be appropriate for my Department to conduct a separate review of the North/South Bodies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The person in question has proposed the inclusion of details regarding illness on a passport. The current Automated Passport System (APS) does not cater for this and its inclusion would require a major redesign of the passport system and booklet. There would be a significant cost involved which would be difficult to justify against the backdrop of the current economic constraints.I will however, keep this proposal in mind for consideration in future developments of the system.  In order to reduce the risk of difficulties while travelling the person in question may wish to consider obtaining a letter from his general practitioner regarding his illness and explaining why it is necessary for him to carry medication and equipment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.A passport application was received by the Passport Office in respect of the person in question on 25 November 2006. The applicant's mother stated that the applicant's father was born in Ireland and that the applicant was, therefore, an Irish citizen and thus entitled to an Irish passport. The person identified as the child's father died prior to the child's birth.Section 7 of the Passports Act 2008 requires that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied that a person is an Irish citizen before issuing a passport. Proofs of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required in respect of all passport applications.  In the case in question, the applicant's mother provided certain documentation as evidence of entitlement to citizenship which purported to establish the identity of the applicant's father. These documents were insufficient to confirm that the individual named by the applicant's mother is the father of the applicant.The Department wrote to the applicant's mother on 10 January 2007 to inform her that, pending the receipt of satisfactory evidence of Irish citizenship, it was unable to issue a passport to the applicant. The Department outlined the proofs required to establish citizenship.  In March 2007, in response to further queries from the applicant's mother, the Department explained further how the relevant proofs might be obtained and took the additional step of contacting the Legal Aid Board on her behalf. However, my Department received no further correspondence on behalf of the applicant.Two years passed before the appearance last Sunday of the newspaper articles referred to by the Deputy. In these articles, it is reported that a brother of the person through whom Irish citizenship is claimed has prepared an affidavit acknowledging the applicant as his brother's daughter and that he has offered to undergo DNA tests to support the child's right to citizenship. No such affidavit has been received by the Department, nor, prior to the appearance of the newspaper articles, had there been any contact from the family of the person through whom citizenship is claimed.Earlier this week, a member of the family made contact with the Department on this matter. The Department will liaise with this family member and the applicant's mother to assist them in establishing whether the applicant is entitled to Irish citizenship. My Department has at all times sought to be of assistance to the applicant and her mother, within the constraints of its legal obligations, and will gladly issue a passport to the applicant if citizenship can be established.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States.  In the absence, to date, of comprehensive immigration reform in the United States, we have actively pursued a bilateral approach in this area, aimed at reforming our overall immigration arrangements with the United States and facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. The approach has had three core objectives: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement; new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term working visas (known as E3s); and a solution for our undocumented.The first of these objectives has already been delivered, and the second, the provision of long term working visas, similar to the E3 Visas available to Australian citizens, has formed the basis for detailed discussions with senior Members of Congress over the past twelve months. Ideally, the undocumented would be able to avail of the proposed visa scheme. However, if that is not possible, as many of our key contacts have advised, their best prospect for a solution lies with comprehensive immigration reform.I would like to emphasise that our efforts in these areas in no way dilute the Government's strong commitment to finding a solution for the undocumented, whose welfare remains a key priority. We are in ongoing contact with US law-makers on this issue. A central part of a solution for the undocumented would be the regularisation of their status in the United States. In the past, regularisation in the United States was facilitated through the adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. Our key contacts advise that adjustment of status could only be addressed after less politically sensitive matters, such as agriculture visas and the DREAM Act, have been advanced.  The Taoiseach and I will use the particular opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US to engage the new Administration at the very highest level on this issue.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund has, from 2001 to 2008, received a guaranteed level of finance each year. This was based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation. Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty was made up by direct Exchequer subvention. In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from €254m to €550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008. By the end of 2008 a total of €545.8m was paid out of the Fund. The remaining balance in the Fund at the start of 2009 was €4.2m. €69.6m has been allocated to the Fund for 2009.The rationale of the Fund is that the horse and greyhound racing industries need certainty in relation to their funding support on a multi-annual basis and that the mechanism for such certainty should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting. Prior to 2001 the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations as well as 0.3% of turnover and a fixed fee from off-course betting.Funding of both of these agencies supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding & training enterprises in the development of the rural economy. These industries, together, account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes. The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity in what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.This funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.  Horse Racing Ireland has undertaken a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.The Fund has also contributed significantly to the almost €90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  A review of the Fund is nearing completion and will be submitted to the Government in due course in the context of deciding on the future funding of these industries. Any extension of the Fund will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas.  The following table details the level of funding that has been available to the horse and greyhound sector from this Fund for each of the past eight years.Fund Year20042005200620072008Fund Income66,914,00068,350,00070,059,00073,111,00076,285,800HRI53,531,20054,680,00056,047,00058,539,00061,028,800BNG13,382,80013,670,00014,012,00014,572,00015,257,000

The administration of the schemes is a matter for the Irish Sports Council and the Gaelic Athletic Association.In light of the current economic constraints and the reduction in the ISC's allocation of funding in the 2009 Estimates, I am having discussions with the Council on optimum funding options, in order to maintain its existing programmes while building on recent progress.  The future funding of the Gaelic players schemes is being considered in that context.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The club in question was allocated €250,000 under the sports capital programme 2007.  Under the terms and conditions of the programme, a "sunset clause" provision exists whereby the Department can fully or partially withdraw grants in the absence of satisfactory progress being made by the grantee, for any reason, in drawing down the grant.  In addition, the terms and conditions require the execution of a Deed of Covenant and Charge for allocations above a specified threshold.  A Deed provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated and is intended to protect the taxpayers' investment in the project.Arising from difficulties with the title to the site of the facility that was the subject of the 2007 provisional allocation, the club has not progressed the payment of the grant and has recently sought to transfer the allocation to an alternative site.  The position routinely applied by the Department heretofore is that when a club changes site, any grants to the original site fall as the grant application has been assessed on the basis of the original location.Notwithstanding the above, my Department is prepared to examine the request from the grantee in question to transfer a grant allocated under the programme to an alternative site.  My Department wrote to the club on 13 February 2009 specifying the documentation required to fully consider such an application.  A response to that letter is currently awaited.In recognition of the difficult position faced by the club in progressing the project, the deadline from which monies can be drawn down will also be extended. However, it is important that the club respond to the letter of 13 February and keep my Department informed of ongoing developments. Grants cannot be held open indefinitely and every effort should be made to progress projects as speedily as possible.

Waterways Ireland has furnished its Annual Reports and Accounts for each year from 2000 to 2006 and copies of these Reports have been published and are available in the Oireachtas Library as well as on http://www.waterwaysireland.org.  The 2007 Annual Report and Accounts will be laid before the Houses shortly and will be available in the Library.An Foras Teanga comprises two agencies, Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency.  Each agency has furnished my Department with draft reports and annual accounts for each year from 2000, up to and including 2007.  The draft 2008 annual reports and accounts for each agency are due to be submitted by end-March 2009. Once the individual annual accounts for each agency have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) or Northern Ireland Audit Office, as appropriate, they require to be consolidated.  The consolidated accounts are then jointly examined and certified by the two C&AGs, North and South.  To date, consolidated reports and accounts for the years 2000 to 2004 have been finalised and copies of these Reports are available in the Library and on the Foras website: www.gaeilge.ie.  The 2005 accounts have also been consolidated and it is hoped that these can be published later this year, subject to sign-off by the two C&AGs.At the most recent meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in Language Sector Format on 16 January 2009, the Chief Executives of the two agencies assured both Minister Campbell and I that finalisation of all outstanding annual reports and accounts continues to be given the utmost priority.  Both Ministers also acknowledged the inherent complexities in compiling, auditing and consolidating these annual reports and accounts and the efforts of both agencies to progress this work.The certificate of the C&AGs in both jurisdictions provides assurances in regard to the systems of governance in place.  Further assurances are provided at monitoring and other meetings between the agencies and the Sponsor Departments and by way of additional audit reviews, which are carried out from time to time as deemed appropriate.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	409	This issue was the subject of a High Court judgement concerning the rights of a person, who has undergone gender reassignment surgery, to recognition of her acquired gender.  On foot of a High Court judgement, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law.  As such, the High Court judgement is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act. The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on. It will be a matter for the Government as a whole to decide on an appropriate overall approach to deal with the many issues arising from the High Court judgement.As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment in detail at this time, other than to say that I am keeping the matter under review.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that Section 5(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a declaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the existing law relating to civil registration.

On receipt of all the necessary documentation and information her claim was disallowed as she failed to satisfy the habitual residence condition which applies to all social welfare means tested schemes.  The position regarding her means including her partner's income is not relevant as she failed to satisfy the habitual residency conditions.Notification of the decision and her right to appeal issued on 16 February 2009 but there is no record of an appeal having been made.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In May 2008 an additional 31 staff were assigned to local offices to deal with the increased volume of claims all of these staff are in place.Following on from this a further staffing review was undertaken in October and an additional 115 were allocated.  By late February 83 of these staff were in place and start dates have been agreed for a further 12 in early March.  In addition to this a separate staffing review was undertaken in Cork local office resulting in the allocation of 12 extra staff.As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, we have decided to set up a number of central decision units around the country.  Four such units are currently being set up in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Each unit will have 10 staff and the Department expects that all of these staff will be in place within the next few weeks.  Work has recently commenced on setting up a further unit in Roscommon and this unit should be operational within the next two months or so.A number of offices have a particularly high volume of claims awaiting a decision.  In order to deal with this, 32 additional temporary staff were recruited with effect from 2 March to support these offices.  A further 16 Social Welfare Inspectors are being assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseeker's allowance.  This brings the total additional staff being assigned to 246.It is recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself will not deal with the rising claim load.  Since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls. Examples of process improvement initiatives introduced recently include:A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 yearsApplication forms for the jobseeker's schemes are now available on the Department's website. This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed. This helps reduce queuing times.More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introducedWe will shortly be introducing a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseeker's benefit expires.We have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in some offices and plan to extend this to other offices over the coming months.Becoming unemployed and having to claiming a jobseeker's payment is difficult for people.  By introducing these initiatives I am trying to ensure that the process is as easy as it possibly can be for people.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The back to work scheme was introduced to assist long term unemployed people, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients to return to active employment either by taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  It is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work allowance (BTWA) for persons who take up employment and the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for persons who become self employed.To qualify for the back to work enterprise allowance a person must set up a self–employment business that has been approved by a Partnership Company or a department's facilitator and, in the case of someone on the live register, they must be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for 2 years prior to commencing their self employment.  Participants on the back to work enterprise allowance receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a four year period.  Participants may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.The operation of the scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.  I can assure you that the Government is absolutely determined to do all we can to help get people back to work and the scheme will continue to be monitored in this context.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The person concerned was refused jobseeker's allowance on 3rd February 2009.  The deciding officer, having examined all the circumstances, considered that the person concerned did not satisfy the habitual residence condition as her centre of interest within Ireland and future intentions to remain in Ireland have not been clearly established, in view of her employment record here or any alternative means of  support while living here.The person concerned was notified of the decision in writing on 3rd February 2009 and informed of the right of appeal against the decision.The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers.  Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.The habitual residence condition requires the applicant to satisfy the Deciding Officer that they meet certain conditions, including that their centre of interest is in Ireland and that their future intentions, as demonstrated, are to remain in Ireland.EEA nationals who have been employed since arriving in Ireland may be entitled to Supplementary Welfare Allowance, even if they do not satisfy the HRC condition for jobseeker's Allowance.  Such persons should enquire with their local Community Welfare Officer as to their possible entitlement to Supplementary Welfare Allowance as a migrant EU worker.This parliamentary question has been accepted by the Office of the Chief Appeals Officer as notification of appeal, and an appeal form SWAO1 has been issued to the person concerned for completion.  On receipt of the completed appeal form, the Office of the Chief Appeals Officer will make a determination on the case and the person concerned will be advised of the outcome directly.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The available resources are then used to discharge the Department's obligations towards our claimants and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.  With the increase in the number of people applying for jobseeker's payments staff in local offices have been working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible, however there are delays in some areas.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation.SWA payments are divided into two main categories:those who have income needs that cannot be met from mainline social welfare payments, andthose awaiting a social welfare payment.The majority of SWA claims are processed within a matter of days.  Any instance of excessive delays in processing claims should be brought to the attention of Community Welfare Service management in the particular Health Service Executive area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	417	In Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week.  These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.Since 1997 weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been 332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  It is estimated that combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carers will be €650 million in 2009.

The estimates for jobseeker's Benefit and jobseeker's Allowance were based on the Department of Finance's prediction at that time of an average Live Register of 290,000 for the year.Developments in relation to the Live Register are being closely monitored by the Government.  Decisions about the adequacy of current resources available to the Department will be taken in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	419	The habitual residence condition was introduced in order to ensure that a person, who has had no attachment to the work force since arrival in Ireland and whose habitual residence is elsewhere, would not be entitled to payment under certain exchequer-funded schemes on arrival in Ireland. Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice, and which are now incorporated into our domestic social welfare legislation.  The five factors are:(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;(d) the person's main centre of interest, and(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.There is currently no discrimination on grounds of nationality in social welfare legislation and to introduce such a provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in our own equality legislation, and that we are obliged to respect by virtue of other international conventions.It is alleged that Irish persons who have returned to live permanently in Ireland have been deprived of entitlement on the grounds of the habitual residence condition.  However, my Department has been unable to trace any such cases, and has offered to review any cases that are brought to its attention.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.Qualification for payment under this scheme requires that a person must be engaged in insurable employment for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.Improvements to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and, in recent years, the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.If a low income worker does not work sufficient hours to claim FIS, there is a range of other payments which may be more appropriate.  For instance, people working up to three days per week may instead apply for a jobseeker's payment, provided they are unemployed for the remainder of the week and continue to seek full-time work.  Entitlement can be either insurance based (jobseeker's benefit) or means-based (jobseeker's allowance).  Any changes to the qualifying criteria of any scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The household benefits package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability social welfare payments or carer's allowance.  The package which includes the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is payable throughout the year to over 358,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households costs for 2009 are estimated at over €385 million in 2009.There are no plans to amend the qualifying criteria for the household benefits package.  The Department will continue to review the operation of the scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	422	There has been no change in the treatment of firefighters for jobseeker's payments.  Social Welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an on-going basis is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.Part-time fire-fighters are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment i.e. they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work and, in this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat them differently to any other jobseeker's benefit or allowance claimant.In applying the legislation, Deciding Officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, the age and educational qualifications together with the family circumstances of the particular claimant.  Regard is also had to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities in their locality.The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature she or he would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which she or he is qualified.  It is a principle of the availability for work condition that a person's unemployment must be involuntary and it is not possible for an unemployed person to hold herself or himself available exclusively for employment that is within a restricted distance from a fire station where she or he is employed as a part-time fireperson.  Such action would be taken as placing an unreasonable restriction on his/her availability to secure full-time employment.While the importance of retained fire brigade personnel is fully recognised, the introduction of special arrangements exempting them from the requirements to fulfil any of the statutory conditions for entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or allowance would raise equity issues vis-à-vis other claimants to jobseeker's payments and there are no current plans to make any changes to this legislation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	423	There has been no change to the provisions relating to the entitlement of self-employed persons to a jobseeker's allowance.  Self-employed people may apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.Their means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.  While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the assessment of future income.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's Allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.  In addition it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office.

Payment should have stopped when she ceased employment on 29 August 2008, however, she failed to notify the family income supplement section of the change in her circumstances.She applied for, and was awarded, One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) with effect from 12 June 2008.    During a review of her claim, in January 09, it came to light that she was still in receipt of FIS, not withstanding the fact that she had provided a P45 to the local office in September 2008.  Her FIS payment was duly stopped and an overpayment assessed at €3006.00 as she was not entitled to receive this payment when she ceased to be employed.The person concerned has been informed of the accrual of the overpayment, and of her right to appeal the overpayment assessed against her. It is open to her to submit an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, D'Olier House, and while she has not done so, this question is being treated as an appeal.

I have no plans to change this position.  The rules in relation to the application of Vehicle Registration Tax, which apply to the registration of second hand imports, are a matter for the Minister for Finance.

The insurance requirements for contractors wishing to carry out works grant-aided under the scheme are designed to protect homeowners.I am advised that the insurance requirements for the scheme have been developed by SEI with advice from experienced insurance professionals and in consultation with a range of market actors, including architectural and construction bodies.  The employers' liability sets an indemnity level of €13 million, which is the minimum level available in the market.  The public/product liability indemnity level is set at €6.5 million, which is the same level as is required of electricians to register with the Register of Electrical Contractors in Ireland (RECI).  SEI advises that these insurance levels are reasonable and in line with typical cover in the sector.In order to avail of the benefits of participating in the scheme, contractors with insufficient levels of insurance have the option of upgrading their cover, usually for relatively modest premium increases.  A number of contractors applying to register with the scheme have already done so.  To date, no contractors have been excluded and those that have not met the insurance requirements have been contacted and offered the opportunity to resubmit their applications.

For this reason, there will be sufficient eligible expenditure during the period to maximize Ireland's draw down of co-funding notwithstanding the suspension of the above Scheme for new applications.I have made provision of €9.7m for 2009 to meet current commitments under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme and the preceding equivalent schemes.

As an application form had not been received from the school, my Department recently contacted the school management in the matter. When the application is received, it will be addressed as a matter of urgency and the school informed of the position without delay.

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The number of mainstream class teachers appropriate to a school for 2009/10 school year is determined by reference to the school's valid enrolment on 30  September, 2008. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.The staffing schedule also makes provision for schools that are projecting significantly increased enrolments for September 2009 through the allocation of what are known as "developing posts". These classroom teaching posts are allocated to schools based on projected enrolments for September 2009 rather than on past enrolments for September 2008 which is the case for most schools.  This allocation process for developing posts takes places during the Spring and Summer period when schools apply to the Department based on their projected enrolments for September 2009. The developing posts are allocated on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the school of actual enrolments in September 2009.I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy has applied for the appointment of a mainstream teacher on developing grounds for the coming school year and that provisional sanction will issue to the school on that basis.

Since February 2008, all Capital Works Projects must use the new GCCC Forms of Construction Contracts for Public Works and, as a result, the school was informed that the tender documents for this project would have to be revised prior to proceeding to the invitation of tender.  The revised tender documents have recently been received in my Department and, once it is established that they are in order, the school will be authorised to progress to the invitation of tender.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area —  otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area. In general, catchment boundary tickets are  issued on a first come, first served basis.  Parents/guardians of children wishing to avail of catchment boundary transport, should liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of seats.My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, which is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  This review will be carried out as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews recently approved by Government and, when completed, will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.The costs in school transport, a service delivered by Bus Eireann on behalf of my Department, have been increasing arising from a range of issues such as: in ensuring a comfortable and safe transport service for over 135,000 children daily travelling to and from school, measures to ensure the highest standards including the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat each; the addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses with safety belts; increased demands to meet the needs of special needs children; and parental choice.The introduction of the annual charge which replaces the term payment system will enable Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department, to streamline the current payments system and the allocation of tickets. It will also ensure that route planning and seating arrangements are managed in a more efficient and cost effective manner.  The overall spend in 2009 is now estimated to be €194m —  a reduction of €2m in the revised allocations as a result of efficiencies.In order to minimise the overall impact of these charges on families the increases will apply to the 55,000 eligible post primary pupils and children availing of concessionary transport.  Primary school transport remains free of charge for over 54,500 children.  Parents will be offered the option to spread the amount due over two payments payable in July and December.  A maximum family payment of €650 will apply.  Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.  Taking into account all the factors outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a reduction in the annual charge system, the estimated expenditure or the level of charges.  My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is to be completed before the end of the year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	452	The funding information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  There are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remaining 32 Catholic.  Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive capitation or related supports.Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, the Protestant Block grant, which amounts to €6.5 million in the current school year. This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants. The grant is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among disadvantaged Protestant children. Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.  A similar arrangement exists for the Jewish school and will continue also.The arrangements for minority schools reflect the importance the Government attaches to ensuring that students can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donogh O' Malley; at the time, it was the payment of a block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from the Catholic schools that also chose to continue to charge fees.Prior to Budget 2009, in addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-charging schools were paid a range of support services grants that the Catholic fee-charging schools did not receive. It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from the Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  Teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State; this arrangement pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements. In the absence of fee-paying schools and the enrolment of all pupils in the non-fee paying sector, there would be subsequent additional costs and teachers would still have to be paid.In Budget 2009 the Government has, however, decided to make changes to how fee-charging schools should be treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated. Teachers in fee-charging schools are now allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20 to one, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools. Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.With regard to capital expenditure, school building projects, whether for fee-charging schools or schools in the free education scheme, are selected for inclusion in the Schools' Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria.Considerations of State support for minority religions has been an important factor in the provision of funding for such schools, given that much of the fee-paying sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos.  Minority fee-charging schools qualify for capital grant aid on the same basis as secondary schools in the Free Education scheme; schools make a contribution of 5% of the cost of a new building, with a cap on the local contribution of €63,000, and 10% for an extension or refurbishment, with a cap on their contribution of €31,500. No changes have been made to this arrangement.  Catholic schools receive capital funding at the rate of 50% of the total cost, subject to the individual circumstances of each case.FundingYearCatholicProtestant & Jewish€€Teachers Salaries2004/0556,945,70132,666,9382005/0655,080,02730,906,6882006/0756,143,03134,504,9392007/0861,964,16939,358,959Grant Payments200507,130,307200607,905,817200708,856,191200809,410,392Building Expenditure2005849,858352,08220062,691,3383,201,96220071,004,7041,929,4752008642,2211,528,254Supervision Payments2005/06642,144958,0102006/07696,2291,061,1802007/08740,3151,152,351
