            <p eId="para_2">Ba maith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit. Baineann an cheist seo le cothrom na Féinne don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an cothrom na Féinne sin le feiceáil i gcáinaisnéis 2015. De réir Conradh na Gaeilge, tá beagnach dhá mhilliún duine ar oileán na hÉireann a bhfuil cumas éigin sa Ghaeilge acu. Is dóigh gur féidir cleachtadh a dhéanamh chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus táim ag súil leis an bhfeabhas sin a fheiceáil ón Aire Stáit.</p>

            <p eId="para_3">Mar is eol don Teachta, is tríd an phróiseas Meastacháin agus cáinaisnéise a dhéantar leithdháileadh ar an soláthar airgid a chuirtear ar fáil ar bhonn bliantúil don Roinn agus, go deimhin, do na Ranna go léir.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Maidir le buiséad Údarás na Gaeltachta don bhliain 2015, tuigim go bhfuil togra straitéiseach aige lena bhuiséad caipitil a mhéadú thar thréimhse ama ón leibhéal reatha in aghaidh na bliana. Tuigim go gcuirfeadh a leithéid de mhéadú ar an soláthar caipitil ar chumas an údaráis 300 post breise a chruthú in aghaidh na bliana.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> É sin ráite, ba mhaith liom a mheabhrú don Teachta gur fógraíodh, mar chuid de bhuiséad 2014, go mbeadh athbhreithnithe cuimsitheacha ar chaiteachas caipitil agus reatha le cur i gcrích ag na Ranna go léir le linn 2014. Tá na hathbhreithnithe mar bhunús do chreat buiséid ilbhliantúil an Rialtais agus déantar iad ar bhonn tréimhsiúil le cinntiú go bhfuil caiteachas na Ranna i gcomhréir leis na tosaíochtaí Rialtais. Tá na hathbhreithnithe ar bun faoi láthair agus déanfaidh an Rialtas iad a mheas níos deireanaí i mbliana i gcomhthéacs a chuid pleananna caiteachais do 2015 agus do na blianta ina dhiaidh sin. Tuigfidh an Teachta go ndéanfar soláthar airgid an údaráis ón Státchiste don bhliain 2015 a mheas i gcomhthéacs na n-athbhreithnithe sin agus i gcomhthéacs an phróisis Mheastacháin agus cháinaisnéise níos déanaí i mbliana.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Mar is eol don Teachta, is áisíneacht den Fhoras Teanga é Foras na Gaeilge agus, dá réir sin, is í an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas a cheadaíonn a bhuiséad. Déantar Foras na Gaeilge a chómhaoiniú ar bhonn 75% ón Roinn agus ar bhonn 25% ón Roinn Cultúir, Ealaíon agus Fóillíochta i dTuaisceart Éireann. Anuas air seo, cuireann an Roinn maoiniú breise ar leith ar fáil d'Fhoras na Gaeilge i ndáil le nithe imfhálaithe mar a bhaineann le Clár na Leabhar Gaeilge agus Colmcille. Ina theannta sin, faigheann Foras na Gaeilge ioncam ó fhoinsí eile, lena n-áirítear ioncam ó dhíol leabhar. </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Cé go leanfaidh an Roinn ag cur maoiniú ar fáil don Fhoras Teanga i gcomhréir leis an ghnáthphróiseas buiséid, ní miste a shoiléiriú go bhfuil sé aontaithe ag na Ranna Airgeadais sa dá dhlínse go gcaithfidh na forais trasteorann go léir sábháil éifeachtúlachta de 4% ar a laghad a chur i bhfeidhm in 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_8">Deireann Conradh na Gaeilge go bhfuil gá le níos mó airgid a bheith ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta. Táthar ag caint mar gheall ar bhuiséad caipitil de €12 milliún don údarás mar go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh níos mó post a sholáthar sa Ghaeltacht. Leag mé béim i mo cheist ar an mbuiséad d'Fhoras na Gaeilge chomh maith. Tháinig deireadh le maoiniú Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge i mí Meitheamh agus le fostaíocht de seisear den fhoireann a bhí ag obair ann. Beidh suas le 18 duine ag cailliúint a bpoist ansin. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit a chinntiú de nach mbeidh aon ghearradh siar ar bhuiséad Fhoras na Gaeilge i gcáinaisnéis 2015. Bunaíodh Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge i 1943, ach rinneadh gearradh siar ar an mbuiséad do chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta gan aon chainteanna leis an bhforas.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">Níl a fhios agam ón bhfreagra sin cén polasaí atá ag an Aire Stáit maidir leis an mbuiséad caipitil don údarás nó d'Fhoras na Gaeilge. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ag iarraidh níos mó airgid a fháil. Mar atá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit, tá luach eacnamaíoch ag an Ghaeilge don tír seo - is fiú os cionn €20 milliún na coláistí samhraidh Gaeilge don tír - agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire Stáit tacaíocht do na coláistí samhraidh agus go mbeidh sé ag iarraidh níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil dóibh. Tá súil agam freisin go mbeidh sé ag lorg airgid leanúnach, mar a fhaigheann RTÉ, do TG4.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I thank the Deputy for her good wishes and look forward to working with her.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> As the Deputy is aware, revised designs submitted by the owners of the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street for the restoration of the monument buildings and the creation of a commemorative centre to the leaders of the 1916 Rising on the site were approved by my Department on 30 April 2014. Previously, in July 2013, an order of consent was signed that approved the commemorative centre proposal and the full repair and conservation of the monument buildings. However, consent was refused for the demolition of any structures or the removal of material from the site that dated from or before 1916. Any plans for an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument and for the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16 were also ruled out. The July 2013 consent was conditional on revised project designs being submitted to my Department that took full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent had been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works. The revised designs were received in March of this year and, following consultation with interested parties and a full assessment, were approved on 30 April 2014, subject to a number of new conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The decision made on the revised designs will, I believe, secure the future of one of the most important sites in modern Irish history. The accompanying conditions will also ensure that the restored buildings will, from day one, have a standard of finish and appearance that befits their historical importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I understand that NAMA has approved funding for the proposed works to the national monument and it is now a matter for the monument owners to progress the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The forthcoming centenary celebrations of the 1916 Rising are particularly important and the preservation of Moore Street is, of course, a priority. The decision by the Government to grant permission for the development of Moore Street to go ahead is tantamount to the obliteration of what the National Museum has called the most important site in modern Irish history. The Government proposals to turn Nos. 14-17 Moore Street into an interpretive centre, while welcome, are inadequate and fail to match the reality that this is the most important historic site in modern Irish history.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Sinn Féin fundamentally disagrees with the decision to grant a licence to Chartered Land to demolish Moore Street and turn it into a shopping centre. As a new Minister to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, will the Minister revisit this decision and will she review the evidence presented to her Department? The Taoiseach is meeting the relatives as we speak and I hope that meeting will be a fruitful one. Has the Minister met with the Taoiseach yet to discuss Moore Street?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">To answer the last question, I have not had an opportunity to meet with the Taoiseach yet but I am aware the relatives are meeting him as we speak.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The national monument is being protected by the State, as I said earlier, but anything outside Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is a matter for the planning authorities and the owner of the site. I have no function in regard to the regulation of the development outside the bounds of the preservation order.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> As required under the National Monuments Act, an application for consent in respect of proposed works to Nos. 14-17 Moore Street was submitted to my Department on behalf of the owners in June 2013. The application sought consent for a range of works at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, including the provision of a commemorative centre and facilities for visitors, an underground car park to the rear of the monument and also the demolition of the Moore Lane facades at Nos. 15 and 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> On 16 July 2013, the Minister granted consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930. The consent provided for the creation of a commemorative centre at the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, the full repair and conservation of the buildings at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and the demolition of non-original, post-1916 additions and partitions in Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">As guardian of the monument, I believe the Minister shares responsibility for the surrounding area of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street. The entire Moore Street battlefield site should be developed and protected as a national monument. In any other state, these laneways of history would be preserved and would be a vital place of remembrance. This would be a fitting centrepiece for the centenary and an economic boost to the north inner city, as well as a prestigious international educational and tourist facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The Minister is in a new job. She can bring fresh thinking to the role of Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Will she go back to the drawing board and review her Department's decision? Will she consider developing Moore Street and surrounding streets and lanes, encompassing the GPO, as an historic quarter?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">As I said, I have no function in regard to the regulation of development outside the bounds of the preservation order. I mentioned that the Minister granted consent on 16 July 2013 but he also refused consent for the demolition of any structures or removal of material which date from or before 1916. Works for the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument were also refused and the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16 was refused, so they are being protected. It is also important that NAMA has approved funding for the proposed works to the national monument and it is now a matter for the monument owners to progress the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> I accept the Deputy's point that it is a very important site. A lot of work has been done on this to date. I will certainly be protecting the particular area that has been designated as a national monument, as it is my duty to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">The sale of Údarás na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo to Acadian Seaplants Limited was approved by the board of Údarás on 1 March 2013, subject to ministerial approval being obtained and legal details being agreed. Following an assessment of the proposal, approval was granted for the sale on 29 July 2013, subject to a number of specific conditions being fulfilled. I am advised that the sale of Arramara Teo was concluded on 7 May 2014 and that Údarás na Gaeltachta is satisfied that the conditions laid down have been fully complied with. I am satisfied that the best value that could be obtained for Arramara Teo was achieved through this course of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> As a multinational company based in Nova Scotia, Canada, with significant experience in the seaweed processing sector, I am satisfied that Acadian Seaplants Limited has the expertise to develop Arramara Teo and secure its long-term future for the benefit of its stakeholders. I believe this strategic partnership will secure Arramara's future in Connemara and will result in the development of the seaweed processing sector here.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> While I am unable to give further details with regard to the terms of the sale of Arramara Teo because of the confidentiality provisions of the contract, I am advised by Údarás na Gaeltachta that continuity of supply to Arramara's existing Irish customers is assured. One of the conditions of the sale agreement between Údarás na Gaeltachta and Acadian Seaplants Limited related to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo being guaranteed supply of product on reasonable terms and conditions into the future. In that regard, Údarás na Gaeltachta has confirmed that the sale agreement provides for the protection of future supply to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo, with no increase in price for year one and with prices advantageous to Irish customers as against international customers being secured. It is also understood that Acadian Seaplants Limited has covenanted to continue supplying the Irish customers. In the event of a breach of covenant, Údarás na Gaeltachta has advised that penalties would apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> In overall terms, it is envisaged that the sale of Údarás na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo will benefit the State through a cash consideration to Údarás na Gaeltachta, a significant investment in Arramara Teo and the development of the seaweed sector, with benefit accruing to the State as a result of increased economic activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">Questions have been raised about the manner in which the sale took place. It is not good enough for a State body to claim that it cannot tell us exactly how something was done because of commercial sensitivity. Everything could have been done perfectly and completely in order - I am not saying for a second that it was not - but some of the smaller seaweed companies are dubious about how the process was handled. It would be a good idea for the Government to release the details and open the books. If everything is fine, there should be nothing to hide. Alternatively, the Minister of State might consider using an independent investigator to do away with doubts, reservations and suspicions and to clear the air.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">This matter came to my attention a number of weeks ago. In my role as Minister for State, I held a meeting in the Department yesterday because I was anxious to have as much detail on all of today's questions as I could. Seaweed processing is an issue that affects my county as well as a number of others. This contract primarily affects counties on the west coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> When I asked the Deputy's question about disclosure yesterday, it was categorically stated that there was a confidentiality clause. I can raise the Deputy's question about public disclosure again but, according to the information I was given yesterday, the contract was confidential.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> As to the public advertisement and transparency of the process, I understand that Údarás na Gaeltachta considered that the most appropriate mechanism was to engage consultants to identify potential strategic partners in the seaweed industry for the future development of Arramara Teo. I am advised by Údarás na Gaeltachta that the process was carried out in accordance with the 2009 code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_50"> Údarás na Gaeltachta did not apply for a licence. Rather, Arramara Teo did. The licence application was included in the sale. Traditional harvesters could be pushed off the pitch. They are uneasy. Arramara Teo is seeking a three-year licence. Will the Minister of State consider ensuring the licence will not be issued to the new company until three-year deals have been agreed with indigenous harvesters? They will be under pressure standing up against a powerful foreign operation like the Canadian company and could do with State protection. It would be good if the State held off on awarding the licence until contracts were in place with the indigenous harvesters.</p>

            <p eId="para_56"> The National Museum of Ireland is an autonomous body with its own board and, as such, is responsible for all day-to-day operational matters. I, as Minister, have no statutory responsibility in respect of such operational matters, which include the location of monuments on museum sites. However, I have had inquiries made into this matter and understand that the National Museum was not party to any consultation to erect an Irish UN veterans monument on the Collins Barracks site. The museum has advised that Collins Barracks is one of the constituent parts of the museum and functions solely in that capacity to house and display the national collections in its care. The museum has further indicated its view that any interpretation of the previous history of Collins Barracks as a barracks is done in that context only and, accordingly, it would not consider it appropriate to place a monument on the site as proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> As the Deputy is aware, military personnel who died on UN service are commemorated by a monument in Merrion Square, on the annual national day of commemoration and by their own respective military barracks. All of those who died, both on military and non-military service with the UN, are commemorated on the annual national day of commemoration.

            <p eId="para_58">I thank the Minister for her response, although it was a little disappointing. The Irish international contribution to peacekeeping has extraordinarily involved approximately 7 million person days and 61,000 tours of duty in 72 UN-mandated missions. It is a major aspect of our foreign policy. Given the decade of commemorations, this is something that needs to be commemorated.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">It is not just about those who lost their lives, but the wonderful contributions of so many others to international peacekeeping and conflict resolution which have distinguished them and the country. The Minister says other Departments have a role in this. They may, but in the decade of commemorations, the Minister has a leading role.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I acknowledge what the Deputy says and that 61,000 is a great number of veterans. They have made a wonderful contribution. I support the commemoration of all persons who have served their country at home and abroad, especially those who have given their lives. It is important we recognise them. There are already a number of monuments and memorial gardens throughout the country that pay tribute to such men and women. The selection of a site for another monument dedicated solely to UN veterans would require careful consideration. I take on board what the Deputy says. Consideration would fall to include the design, size and scale of the proposed monument, its historical connection with the proposed site and the approval of the relevant planning authorities. I am happy to discuss the matter with the Deputy further. It is important to consider it carefully.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">I take the Minister's reply as positive. Those involved in the campaign include the retired Chief of Staff, Major General Vincent Savino, Malachi O'Gallagher and others who have contributed enormously to the development of the concept. Is the Minister prepared to meet the people behind the initiative? Their enthusiasm for the project, the value of which is beyond question, is infectious. A monument would demonstrate to the people the extent of the contribution we have made to international peacekeeping. If located at a suitably prominent location, there is an opportunity to let the millions of international visitors to Ireland to see at first hand the contribution Ireland has made internationally. Collins Barracks is suggested and seems highly appropriate, but if there is a better location, let it be identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">There are 800 children with native Irish in schools in the Gaeltacht. The Irish language study carried out seven years ago reported that Irish as a community language in the State had 20 years left. There are now 13 years left. Whereas people currently give out about English language documents having to be translated into Irish, we will now have to have Irish language documents translated into English so that the Ministers can understand them. The working language of the Department now becomes English because at its top the Ministers themselves cannot understand Irish. The Ministers are saying to these children to learn Irish and speak Irish among themselves and their families, but not to speak it to the Ministers as they do not have it.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">In focusing on the Deputy's question, which is a good one, I note that this is about bringing the Irish language into people's homes and getting parents to speak it. Nuair a bhí mé i mo chodladh aréir, bhí mé ag smaoineamh i nGaeilge. I was thinking in the language for the first time in a long time. We must get people thinking in the language - ag smaoineamh sa teanga. There is a challenge with the Irish language and I am asking people to follow me on my journey whereby we can reach out to people who got Cs, Bs, and As in the leaving certificate examinations but do not speak it. They have a grá for the language. I ask people to look at that. There is a barrier to getting people involved in the language.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I am conscious of my role as Aire Stáit for the Gaeltacht.

            <p eId="para_80">At the start of the year we had the unprecidented event of An Coimisinéir Teanga, the Ombudsman for the Irish language, resigning such was the disaster of Government policy and commitment to the Irish language. This has never before happened in this State or in any other country. The coimisinéir did not take that decision lightly. He did so because at every step this Government has reduced the level of investment in and emphasis on the Irish language, so much so that people from the Gaeltacht - taxpayers - who want to do their business in the first language of this State can no longer do so because such services are not available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> This Government is sending out a horrendous message in regard to the Irish language in this country. It is literally saying that people should speak it themselves, but should not speak it to the State services, including the health services or to us. </p>

            <p eId="para_84">No question arises in terms of my motivation rather it is a question of confidence - muinín. I am one of a large category of individuals who understands what people are saying when speaking Irish, including the Deputy in terms of the questions he has asked, but I do not have the confidence to converse in Irish. There are four processes to learning any language, the first of which is éist - listen - which is an issue raised in the Deputy's question. We should, perhaps, work on this by way of broadcasting and bringing Irish into people's homes in the morning. The other three processes are labhairt, léamh agus scríobh. When we all went to school we started with the fourth process, which is scríobh. We started writing the language before we understood it. We did not converse in Irish. I did not speak Irish to my tuismitheoirí when I went home in the evening. We started at the end of the process when we should have started with listening to the spoken word. We should be encouraging all of the great advocates of the Irish language, people who understand and speak it, to come to the fore. That is our job. As an individual, I am not going to change the challenges facing us in terms of the Irish language but I want to be a catalyst for it. I want to be the medium through which the many great groups representing the Irish language come to the fore. A consultative group has been already set up by the Government. I propose to work with that group.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">Is oth liom nach bhfuil ar mo chumas an cheist seo a fhreagairt as Gaeilge, ach cuirfidh mé leagan dhátheangach den fhreagra ar fáil don Teachta. As the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht was established on 2 June 2011, my response to the Deputy's question deals with the period since that date. My Department administers a wide range of programmes and measures. Its financial allocations since its establishment reflect the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure and the review of capital expenditure carried out in 2011. While my Department's gross funding has reduced between 2011 and 2014 as part of its contribution to the overall fiscal consolidation, to the greatest extent possible savings have been sought through efficiencies rather than reductions in services. For example, the allocation for spending on administration costs in my Department has fallen by 11% since 2011, from almost €38 million to less than €34 million this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> While the funding adjustments in recent years have posed challenges, I am satisfied that the overall level of resources available to my Department have allowed it to continue to support arts and culture, maintain our built and natural heritage, develop our language and Gaeltacht areas and support island communities and the North-South implementation bodies under its aegis. In doing so, my Department has sought to do the maximum possible to support employment, achieve compliance with EU directives and support the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> My Department's total capital provision has increased by just over €5 million, or 9%, since 2011. In budget 2014, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announced additional funding for a number of new measures in my Department's area, including €10 million for the Cork events centre, €6 million for the Limerick National City of Culture 2014, €5 million for the traditional skills and buildings at risk jobs leverage scheme 2014 which is directed at renovation projects for buildings which are protected and €3.7 million to fund a number of 1916 commemoration projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> I intend to continue with this approach of protecting services to the greatest extent possible, while contributing to economic recovery by supporting new developments in the sectors for which I am responsible. </p>

Tá sé seo in aghaidh an dlí. Anois, sa Dáil tá an rud céanna ar siúl ag an Aire féin.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> Dúirt an t-iar-Choimisinéir Teanga go raibh na heagraíochtaí ag briseadh an dlí de bharr nach raibh siad in ann freagra a chur ar ais chuig daoine i nGaeilge. Conas is féidir linn é sin a athrú muna bhfuil muid in ann é a athrú istigh anseo? Maidir le mo cheist, baineann sí le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus an t-ísliú bhuiséid atá tar éis tarlú. Tá an t-údarás ag cruthú post sna Gaeltachtaí, ach tá ciorrú uafásach déanta ar an mhaoiniú dó i gcomparáid leis an gciorrú a rinneadh ar an IDA nó Enterprise Ireland.</p>

On the issue of replies to questions in Irish, if the Deputy wishes to have his replies in Irish I will ensure they are so provided into the future. On the budgets, the Government wants to maintain services to the public and has done so in so far as possible. The Deputy will be aware that we are in difficult economic times. As I said, services to the public have been maintained in so far as possible. There may be less funding for particular services and events but every effort has been made to maintain front line services.</p>

Tá an tóin tite amach as an mhaoiniú do TG4 agus d'Fhoras na Gaeilge i bhforálacha na cáinaisnéise. Tá an tAire sa Tuaisceart ag iarraidh níos mó airgid a chur isteach i bhForas na Gaeilge, ach ní féidir léi mar nach bhfuil an Roinn anseo sásta an t-airgead céanna a chur isteach. Tá an Rialtas ag cur teorann ar mhaoiniú do na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge ar fad. An fhadhb atá ann anois ná nach bhfuil an t-eolas ag an Aire agus an Aire Stáit maidir leis seo agus níl aon tuiscint acu maidir leis an bpráinn atá i gceist.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">The Arts Council receives funding from my Department but it is independent. It recently published a strategic review of its work, entitled Inspiring Prospects, which was undertaken by a steering group, with Mr. Terence O’Rourke as the independent chairman. I look forward to reading this report in more detail and assimilating its implications. The review and the process underlying it should allow the Arts Council to reflect on whether it delivers the best service it can to the arts sector and the public. Inspiring Prospects is timely in that it should contribute to the process of developing a new national cultural strategy, which the Government has recently agreed. The report is available on the Arts Council’s website at <i>www.artscouncil.ie/News/Arts-Council-publishes-report-from-Independent-Strategic-Review-Group/</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">The Arts Council is no different from any other body spending substantial amounts of public money. At this point, the public needs reassurance. I suspect it will be forthcoming but a review by the Arts Council of its own procedures is certainly not adequate. External analysis of what has occurred within the council is essential because of the importance of transparency and accountability in public bodies generally. In so far as there has been speculation about a conflict of interest - I believe it is no more than speculation - is the Minister prepared to take steps to ensure objective analysis of the procedures that have been employed by the council to disperse funds?</p>

            <p eId="para_107">As I stated, the Arts Council receives its budget from my Department but it is independent. I accept its funds are public money and that we must be very accountable for public money. I understand the council is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is subject to the same rules and regulations as other bodies. I am to meet the new chairman.

            <p eId="para_109"> What is the Minister's position, or instinct, regarding the work of the Arts Council with disadvantaged communities throughout the country? Is she satisfied from her preliminary examination of what the council has been involved in that sufficient work is being done to ensure arts pursuits are not regarded as elitist and that every effort possible is made to bring the arts into all communities in the State, not least disadvantaged communities?</p>

It is important that communities be very much supported in respect of the arts. If the Deputy has any concerns, I can speak to him later about them. I will be happy to pass them on to the representatives of the council when I meet them.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> As I stated, the Arts Council is independent. It is subject to the ethics in public office legislation, and the members of the council make annual returns under that legislation. Meetings of the council are governed by declaration-of-interest protocols in accordance with best practice. Staff at the council are also subject to declaration-of-interest codes. I accept that the Deputy is saying a considerable part of my Department's budget goes to the Arts Council. It is most important, therefore, that the money be spent well. I accept that.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I understand that the Office of Public Works, which is both owner and manager of the Phoenix Park, has no plans to introduce general admission charges to the park, now or in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> The nomination process for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List is initiated by state authorities drawing up a tentative list of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries. Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group in 2010, "The Historic City of Dublin” was one of seven potential nominees chosen for inclusion in Ireland’s tentative list.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> My Department’s policy, which mirrors that of UNESCO, is that nominations for world heritage status must be driven in the first instance by local authorities and communities. Against that background, my Department hosted a seminar in September 2013 for local authorities and community representatives from the areas of the sites on Ireland’s current tentative list to gauge the level of interest in the potential nominations and to clarify the significant research and other requirements involved in preparing nomination documentation. I understand that, in the meantime, a steering group has been established by the lead authority, Dublin City Council, with the objective of progressing the Historic City of Dublin nomination. In line with both national and UNESCO policy, any advancement of the nomination will feature extensive public consultation over the course of the nomination process and in regard to any specific proposals that might arise from it.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I thank the Minister for that reply, which has many positive aspects. The Phoenix Park is an amazing facility and amenity. It is 350 years old and is larger than Central Park in New York.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">There is a railway line underneath it, linked with a series of tunnels and a station. It also contains Viking burial sites, the Magazine Fort, the remains of a 5,500 year old neolithic village and the Wellington monument, which has the odd distinction of being Europe's largest phallic symbol, not to mention the wildlife, birds, flora and fauna, and a cricket club which was founded by Parnell's father. When we consider the use made of the Phoenix Park, it can be regarded as a world heritage site in itself. Even if Dublin is not awarded world heritage status, a case can be made for the park. Issues arise in regard to unregulated parking in the park and safety for pedestrians in certain areas but these could be addressed without doing serious damage to the park or undermining free access to it.</p>

However, we are happy to support the local authority in progressing the matter. Regarding the issue of unregulated parking and traffic, I am happy to have that examined with a view to resolving it.

            <p eId="para_124">My Department is committed to implementing the priorities set out in the programme for Government and in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, which was published by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on 11 July. These will form the underlying basis of the work of my Department for the next 12 months and for the remainder of this Government's term of office.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> The statement of Government priorities identifies six key priorities for the coming period. My Department will have a particular contribution to make in relation to three of these priorities, as follows: strengthening the domestic economy and prioritising new jobs for the unemployed; rebuilding trust in politics and public institutions; and protecting and enhancing peace in Northern Ireland. It will remain a key objective for my Department to maximise the economic and employment creation potential of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. In this context, I will continue to develop synergies between the arts, cultural, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors, most notably in the area of tourism product development and cultural tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> The statement of Government priorities makes specific reference to the co-ordination and organisation of events and commemorations related to Ireland's path to independence that are respectful to the different traditions and communities on the island of Ireland. In that context, I will continue to advance plans for the programme of commemorative events in the context of the Decade of Centenaries 2012-22, including the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> I also look forward to promoting North-South co-operation in the context of the remit of my Department and, in particular, through the work of the North-South implementation bodies that my Department co-funds, namely, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga. Other key issues in the context of the programme for Government will be the continuation of efforts to implement with stakeholders the national peatlands strategy and the 20 year strategy for the Irish language. I am very new in the job but I will be drawing up my personal priorities for the Department and I will be happy to outline them for the House at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I welcome what the Minister has said and cannot disagree with the majority of the priorities set out. However, as Deputy Tóibín and others have pointed out, there is growing public concern about the Government's commitment to Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. There is real concern that the Government has no enthusiasm for implementing the strategy and many aspects are falling behind in their delivery. I was impressed by the fact that 10,000 people took to the streets of Dublin last February to protest about the status of the language and what they regard as the Government's lack of commitment to it. We have two new brooms in the Department. I do not question their commitment but at the end of the day they will be judged by what they do. Can we see some renewed vigour on the part of the Minister and the Minister of State in regard to the stratéis?</p>

            <p eId="para_129">We are committed to the Irish language. As I noted in several interviews, like many others I learned school Irish but unfortunately if one does not use it, one loses it. My parliamentary assistant, who is in his early 20s, was awarded student of the year for his Irish. He told me this morning that he is one of many who does not use it and then loses it. There is a huge cohort of people like me and we need to bring these people in by reintroducing the Irish language so that we use it more regularly. Confidence is important. Many of us know Irish but we do not have the confidence to stand up and speak it. I am totally committed to the protection and further advancement of the Irish language so that it is used much more widely in everyday contexts.</p>

            <p eId="para_138"> With the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, in July 2013 my predecessor made a determination under the National Monuments Acts on the consent application and related environmental impact statement submitted by the owners for their proposals for the national monument. I outlined this to Deputy McLellan earlier. The completed designs for the approved works have been submitted to my Department to verify they are in compliance with the decision made on the consent application in July 2013. In addition, NAMA has confirmed to my Department that it will make the necessary funding available for the works covered by the consent. This adds considerably to the prospects of a fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders being in place in Moore Street in time for the centenary of the 1916 Rising. Information on the developing commemorative programme will be available on my Department's commemorations website and individual announcements will issue for specific events.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> The Deputy asked about the GPO and I had an opportunity through the commemorations committee to examine the proposals. It is a fine proposition and the Deputy will be very pleased when he sees what is planned for the GPO. I would be glad to hear Deputies' views on commemorative arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">Would the Minister be prepared in the very near future to have an informal engagement with each of the spokespersons about the commemoration ceremonies? There has been much public interest in the suggestion that the British royal family may have particular involvement in the 1916 Rising commemoration. Does the Minister have views on that or does she envisage taking any particular initiative in that regard? The site at Moore Street has been alluded to and I accept the Minister's response that she is not directly responsible for anything outside the curtilage of the national monument. None the less, it is incumbent on whoever holds the ministerial office to engage with Dublin City Council and planners to ensure the rest of the site would be developed sensitively. There must be some kind of active engagement in that regard, as the issue cannot be left to NAMA, Chartered Land or Dublin City Council. We have seen lately how one cannot always be enthusiastic about the decisions of the planning department at Dublin City Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">While there are some problems in this legislation, it has improved since Second Stage and Committee Stage, as the Minister has taken on board some of our suggestions. He is one of the few Ministers to have taken on board the substance of the majority of the issues we raised, with one exception. Search and retrieval fees, Irish Water, Eirgrid, and bringing a draft order before the House are all issues we raised. It is a tribute to us in opposition but also to the Minister that he has accepted them. Other Ministers might not have done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> We asked that before a regulation is passed it be brought to the House. That is in my amendment No. 17. I tabled it on Committee Stage but withdrew it in order to have it discussed in the Chamber, not outside, after which it would be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or laid in the Oireachtas Library. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 allow for this and state that a draft order will require a resolution of the House. I would even have been happy with a debate at the relevant committee but it is good to require a resolution of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I compliment this Minister in particular because other Ministers should have done this. As I said on Committee Stage, I do not trust the Government generally but will in most cases make an exception for this Minister. The former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government laid the statutory instruments for Irish Water in the Oireachtas Library at very short notice, making it almost impossible for the local authorities to meet the deadlines. That was because the draft instruments were not brought before this House. That is the substance of this amendment and of the issue I am speaking about. I contrast what the Minister is agreeing to do, which I am happy about, with what his former Cabinet colleague did in respect of amending the local property tax rate by local authorities. That was published only a couple of days ago, which made it almost impossible for local authority members to meet that objective and to honour commitments made by the Minister’s party and mine. He did it slyly by placing it in the Library without any debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas or at any committee. That was not the way to do it. The way this Minister is doing it, bringing it before the House for a positive resolution, is a welcome contrast to how other Ministers act. I single out that example because it happened recently and is probably the most topical one at the moment. When we come to amendment No. 17, I will be happy to withdraw it because I am satisfied with the Minister’s amendments Nos. 33 and 34, which achieve the same objective.</p>

My amendment therefore proposes a retrospection period of seven calendar years. It would be important for the sake of public confidence and in the interest of open government and transparency that a period potentially relevant to accessing information on the economic crisis not be excluded on the basis of being out of time. I propose therefore that we shift the timeline back as contained in my amendment.</p>

I have discussed this on foot of our previous discussion with the chief executive officers, CEOs, of bodies that will be embraced now. Going back so far where they have not marshalled the data would be an enormous administrative burden. The Act will be applied retrospectively but that must be in a way that is practical. I am satisfied, having reflected upon it, that the date I selected, 21 April 2008, which is a long way back – many resist going back that far – strikes an appropriate balance between pushing it back to a reasonable start date and imposing a burden on the bodies such that they could not marshal the data for so many years in an appropriate form for FOI, which would be unreasonable.

          <p eId="para_178">I have no doubt that there would be some resistance to retrospection and by definition any level of retrospection brings with it an administrative workload. Will the Minister consider that again, bearing in mind that this Act is part of the architecture to which the general public as well as the political class or journalistic fraternity look for confidence in the public system, for transparency and accountability? Given the calamity the State and more importantly, the people, have come through, it is really important that the retrospection capture those additional 15 months. It does add administration but I do not accept that it is so onerous as to be the argument to reject the amendment. I hope the Minister takes my point about the timeline because there will be an inquiry into matters related to banking. There is probably a range of questions in the public mind that might legitimately be asked about that period, when the Minister was not in office, and which should be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I disagree entirely with the Minister's analysis. I ask him to reconsider. I will be pressing this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">As I have said, my intention is that 21 April 2008 will be the date that will apply to the vast majority of bodies under the Act. We will all recall that 2008 was before any of the egregious things that happened during the banking and financial crisis. All of those things flowed after that date. All of that area will be captured by this date. There has to be a balance. As the Deputy can imagine, when I was making the case for the date to be 2008, there was significant push-back from many people who did not want to go that far. I was reminded that this would impose a substantial additional burden on people. I was told that by definition, documentation was not in a form that was appropriate to freedom of information. It was suggested that it was onerous enough on them to have to go back all those years. I think this is a reasonable step in that context. Of course the Minister has the power to extend the retrospective date. That is done on a case-by-case basis. The imposition of a date other than 21 April 2008 will be considered on a case-by-case basis. For the generality of organisations that will be encompassed by freedom of information, it is reasonable to have a clear start date. It is signalled in the legislation. They have been preparing for it. I do not want to impose a burden on them over and above that.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_192">In page 12, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_196">It is a note to self. The notion underpinning this amendment is that there should be some coherence in the collation of data about freedom of information requests that are granted, refused or delivered on. We discussed this proposal on Committee Stage. This amendment seeks to provide for such coherence and define in legislation how it can be achieved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_197">A number of the amendments in this group are in my name. As the Minister knows, we discussed some of them on Committee Stage. Some of them are not quite new. Amendment No. 37 seeks to "make provision for the establishment of a database to include all information released under the Act" and to provide that "such database shall be made available to the public" to easily obtain. I am asking that this be done "within 12 months on the enactment of this Act".</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Amendment No. 38 seeks to ensure that each of the many freedom of information bodies "shall ensure that all staff employed by that body dealing with FOI requests shall be provided with adequate training". I think everyone will agree that this is needed. I am aware that a code of practice and certain procedures will be developed. I am asking for a firm commitment that this will actually be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Amendment No. 80 proposes that "The Minister shall, within 3 months of the enactment of this Act, draw up and publish a code of practice". We need to see that. I am putting a timeline on it because I do not like to see these matters drifting. Given that this legislation will have to go through the Seanad in the autumn, I presume we will be into next year before it is enacted. I would like to see a timeline on the code of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Amendment No. 81 proposes that the code of practice provided for in amendment No. 80, which calls for the code to be introduced within three months, "shall include provisions to promote the publication of official and other information". I want to replace the word "may", which is in the Bill as it stands, with the word "shall" because it is more definitive. I always worry about the word "may" because it leaves open the idea that something may not be done. I want to make the promotion of the publication of information compulsory because, as the Minister will be aware, public officials have statutory protection if they release something through freedom of information. They do not have that protection if they release information other than through freedom of information. There can be a lacuna if information is released in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> As a Member of this House, I have had experience in this regard with different Departments over the years. I do not recall a particular case. I have often made a request for specific information on a certain topic to be sent to me, only to be advised by an official that I should submit a freedom of information request, or get the person on behalf of whom I am making the inquiry to submit a freedom of information request, so that the information in question can be released promptly under freedom of information. Some Departments are good at releasing information promptly, but others are not so good at it, perhaps because they are not comfortable with the process or they are concerned that some issue might arise down the road if the information is released other than through freedom of information. I am trying to get rid of that type of culture and make sure provision "shall" be made for the promotion the publication of official and other information.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Many new bodies have come under the aegis of the Freedom of Information Acts in recent times. More of them will be covered by freedom of information as time goes by. I hope most of the new bodies will be covered. Irish Water has eventually come around to that point of view. There is still a culture of not releasing information, however. Local authorities are notorious for not releasing it. I will give a little example. I tried to search the websites of local authorities to find details of licences issued for public events. That information is not available on most local authority websites. They do not even have a link. There are sections on planning, planning queries, planning exemptions and county development plans, but there is nothing about licences that have been issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Hundreds of thousands of people will attend events like the National Ploughing Championships and the Electric Picnic that are to be held in my home county in the coming months. Information on these public events should be publicly available. I have been told that managerial orders are meant to be public, but they are not public. They are probably in a ledger in the bottom drawer of a desk in the office of some staff member or manager somewhere. One would probably need a code to access some of these documents. It is like the third or fourth secret of Fatima. People will say they are available in theory to be inspected, but they cannot be found or accessed. I have never seen a register of managerial orders published. I do not see it on local authority websites.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> This level of secrecy also seems to apply to tender documents, for example, when houses are being built. I will give an example. When some houses were being built in my constituency, a list of tenders was published. A list is normally issued to every company that has made a tender application so that it knows where its price stands by comparison with the other prices that were received. That list does not seem to be publicly available even though millions of euro in public money is spent on various schemes, such as those involving the construction of schools and roads. It is difficult to get information from the National Roads Authority about major roads projects. I am not talking about the secrecy that attaches to some commercial aspects of public private partnerships. I am talking about trying to get information from public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> My view is that, in general, public bodies would not provide information if they were not forced to do so and would not make decisions if they were not legally required to do so within a certain timeframe. Decisions would never be made on some planning applications if a legal timeframe did not apply. They are decided on only because there is a legal timeframe. There must be a legal mechanism to promote the publication of official and other information. The Minister might take on board the generality of what I am saying here now. When one asks public bodies for information, such as a list of the licences that were issued in a certain county or a list of the prices that were received from tenders that were opened, they almost ask why one wants to know such details.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">They might not say that but that is the attitude. I am not referring to the people in my county with whom I have an excellent relationship, but it is across the board. With regard to the Health Service Executive, I will not even go there. If one tries to get information through a parliamentary question, it is referred to the HSE and about six weeks later, which I believe is its normal timescale, one receives a letter. The person about whom one is inquiring could be dead or alive at that stage, but that is how it operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Publishing information, and I am not talking about personal information, is not yet fully ingrained in the public service. I hope this measure will help, but it will take more than this Bill. It will take the Minister's code of practice to force it through, and that is why I inserted the word "shall". I will not go to the wire on the word "shall" versus "may" but am merely making my point.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_208">My question is more to do with the compatibility of two legislative measures. I raised issues about historical records as they relate to genealogy on Committee Stage and I was reassured by what the Minister said on some aspects of that but the Bill defines birth, death and marriage records as personal records. I attended an event recently where the Minister for Social Protection was helping to launch the online indexes of the General Register Office. Regarding the actual records, she announced that there would be a change in the relationship. My understanding is that it would become a much more public process but that a time limit would apply, it being 100 years for births, 50 years for deaths and 75 years for marriages. Is one legislative measure compatible with the other? Will those records become public records within those time limits as opposed to personal records as defined by this legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Has thought been given to the issues that might be thrown up relating to the terms of reference for the inquiry into the mother and baby homes? Are there issues that have been considered in the context of that inquiry? To take the example of the Magdalen women, I found it difficult to work through a number of cases with some of my constituents. They are believed because the institutions' records are available but general records from the Department of the Environment, where there would have been a linkage with local government and the Poor Law, may not contain the persons' names but by virtue of the fact that they do not, it disproves something that is being taken as proof. In that situation, access to records has a bearing on the individual. Has that been considered in the context of freedom of information or does it need to be considered?</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_110" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_210">A number of different issues were raised and I will deal with them on a Deputy by Deputy basis. On the amendments submitted and spoken to by Deputy McDonald, Nos. 13, 43 and 48, as I indicated previously I am not inclined to accept Deputy McDonald's proposal to appoint an FOI data manager. I agree with the Deputy, however, that the role of the FOI central policy unit, which lies within my Department, needs to be significantly enhanced in terms of establishing, supporting and securing compliance with good practice across all public bodies subjected to FOI.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> A strong, expert and authoritative leadership of the FOI central policy unit is critical to the effective and efficient operation of FOI across public bodies. One of the deficiencies I discovered, and I have been using FOI over the years, is the lack of consistency in application and the lack of proper training for FOI officers. As I have indicated previously, the Department of Social Protection gives out a great deal of information but it is very difficult to extract information from others. We need to have uniformity and a common practice and understood code. </p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The central policy unit is responsible, in consultation with public bodies and working with the newly established FOI networks, to ensure the policy and legislative framework that supports FOI is effective and operates across all public bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_213"> In particular I expect that the strengthened system which is intended to be put in place for dealing with requests in public bodies and the measures to promote the proactive publication of information without FOI, which is also important - we should be putting up more - would lead to a substantial increase not only in the data available but a diminution in the need for FOI requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I have also considered Deputy McDonald's proposal that all FOI decisions and determinations, and all extensions of time for consideration of FOI requests, should be submitted to a data manager. Notwithstanding the fact that I am not in favour of the appointment of a data manager <i>per se</i>, I have provided in the draft code of practice that I published - I think I circulated it to everybody - that statistics should be collected, including statistics on the proportion of requests answered within the statutory timescales, the number of requests that had been refused, the number of reviews that have been carried out and so on and provided by organisations subjected to FOI.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I have also provided that all public bodies would publish disclosure logs which would set out, for example, the date of the request, what was sought, the decision made and the date of release. That goes a long way to meeting the needs expressed eloquently on Committee Stage by Deputy McDonald.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Regarding Deputy Fleming's amendments Nos. 37, 38, 80 and 81, much of what the Deputy said fits into what I regard as the most exciting initiative that I am determined to drive, which is not FOI but open data. We need to have, as a matter of routine, data sets available. That is a separate but very important discussion. </p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Deputy Fleming's amendment No. 37 proposes to establish a database to include all information released under the Act. As Deputy Fleming will be aware, a review of the implementation of the FOI Act was carried out and in that context, consideration was given to the publication of all records which are released. It is something I thought might be a good idea. The report of the external review group set out that some Government Departments, such as the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, already publish a disclosure log. Other Departments, such as the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as publishing details of what has been requested, also publish the actual records disclosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> While the external review group recognised the benefits of publishing such information, they all acknowledged the potential legal, administrative and practical difficulties of widely publishing information released under FOI. In addition, the Department in question advised that there is no evidence that the publication of the records led to a more efficient FOI regime, which reduced the number of FOI requests received on the same topics or issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> As already outlined, I proposed in the draft code of practice for FOI that all public bodies would publish disclosure logs on the nature of the information requested and so on and setting out exactly what such logs should include. Furthermore, when someone seeks the records released under FOI, the same record will be provided to the new requester with only the cost of literally reproducing them. As such, the records which have been released can be provided if requested without imposing any additional administrative burden on bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Regarding Deputy Fleming's amendment No. 38, I agree with the sentiment of the proposal and I am happy to advise the Deputy that section 8(11) of the Bill provides that in accordance with the code of practice for FOI, each Minister shall ensure that appropriate measures are taken by public bodies under his or her aegis in respect of training of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In addition, the draft code, which I have already published for consultation, contains detailed information on the training and the obligation of public bodies in this regard. That meets the objective set out, certainly, on Committee Stage by Deputy Fleming.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> In amendment No. 80, Deputy Fleming asks that a code of practice be published within three months of the enactment of the Bill. As outlined, a draft code of practice has been developed based on the findings of the review that I have already circulated to Deputies opposite. I published that draft code recently. It is my intention that the draft code would be finalised on enactment of the Bill. The code, together with the accompanying manuals on the nuts and bolts of the administration of FOI requests and any guidance notes made under the code, will of necessity be living documents that will require to be updated, refined and extended over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I also share Deputy Fleming's view as expressed in his other amendment, amendment No. 81, regarding the publication of official information. I am pleased to advise the House and Deputy Fleming that the draft code contains provisions providing proactive publication of information. It is intended to promote much greater access to information outside of FOI - this is the point I am making about open data - than is currently the case. Greater publication of official data and information is also consistent with the Government's commitment to participate in the multilateral open government partnership, the European element of which I was privileged to host here. In politics, certainly, in an administrative Department such as my own, one does not get excited about new initiatives too often, but I am very excited about the open government partnership. It is a basis for reforming the way Government and agencies of Government operate and providing for much greater openness. For those reasons, I do not see the necessity for the Deputy's amendments and I will not be accepting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Moving on to Deputy Catherine Murphy's request, it is going back to a debate we had at Committee Stage on legislation governing access to birth, death, and marriage certificates held in the General Register Office, GRO. Section 61 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 sets out the governing rules in that regard. Following an application to the GRO, a person may search an index which is open to the public and, following payment of a prescribed fee which is currently €20, can obtain a copy, for example, of anyone's birth certificate. Clearly a certain amount of information would need to be known in order for that search to be carried out - one would have to have the basic data to conduct the search concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The GRO is part of the Department of Social Protection - I note what Deputy Murphy stated in terms of the comments of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton - but the GRO is subject to FOI and will remain subject to this Bill when enacted. The proposed legislation will not prevent access to the registers as provided for under the Civil Registration Act. There is complementarity between legislation in that regard. I am not quite certain of what additional legislative changes the Tánaiste is proposing. I would say Deputy Catherine Murphy is probably more up to speed on that, if she has listened to the utterance of the Tánaiste, than myself. I am sure we will discuss that when the relvevant legislative provision, if it is new, comes before the Houses. Certainly, it would have to come to Cabinet in the first instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">That said, and following on from some of the contributions from Deputy Sean Fleming, we all recognise that there is a cultural resistance to varying degrees around the sharing of information. To address that aspect the Minister indicated where data is to be freely shared. This should at some point, at least in theory, render FOI legislation, if not redundant, certainly less critical in the architecture. We are not yet there and we have some way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> I appreciate what the Minister said in terms of the code of practice. He acknowledged the need to have oversight, a statistical analysis, etc. We are on the same wavelength on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> When I was on my feet, I should have spoken on amendments Nos. 47 and 48 - I only referred to amendment No. 13 - but I do so now. The idea of this data manager and the idea of making it compulsory that this information be submitted to the data manager is to a large extent to intervene legislatively in a way that is mandatory to break and reshape that culture of resistance wherever it exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I still wish to press my amendments. I understand that amendment No. 13 will be the critical one in the group because the other two flow from it. I take the view that it is necessary to have it stated in legislation, to have this data manager in place and to have statutory obligations associated with the submission of information on an annual basis to that manager. At this point, it is a necessary measure. Undoubtedly, I hope that this kind of provision would be unnecessary at a future point but, as I stated, we are not at that point just yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I appreciate the Minister's comments. He stated that under section 8 (11) each Minister of the Government shall, in accordance with the code of practice made under section 48, ensure that the relevant measures are put in place to deal with the code of practice. Unfortunately, and I will not unnecessarily labour the point, while section 8 speaks of "shall", section 48, when it deals with code of practice, states "The Minister may draw up". The Minister has answered it in a way. It was not as tight as that, but I accept his good faith on it. At this stage, I am getting tired of saying that.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">The Minister has gone a lot of the way. At the end of this process, I am sure there will be an issue or two, but generally, out of all the sections in the legislation, it will have fairly substantial cross-party support.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> My only other issue is directly related to this, but the Minister cannot do much about it. It refers to the question of data. The Minister represents Wexford which, like my own, is a rural constituency. Not only are there parts of Wexford, Laois and several other countries that do not have adequate broadband for citizens to avail of this open data to check on Government bodies but, while there is a mix of broadband services available, there are large parts of the Minister's constituency where there is not even a mobile telephone signal. I am sure the Minister loses his signal in some parts of his county - in parts of mine, I do. I am only saying one must enable citizens access this information. While this is not within the Minister's remit, I should point out that open data will only be as good as the communication highways to allow citizens get at the data.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">The point I was trying to make is that this Bill defines the GRO records as personal records. What seemed exciting about what the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, had to say was that once the records are outside of the time limits - 100 years for a birth, 75 years for marriage and 50 years for a death - they become public records. There is one piece of legislation stating that they are public records within a defined space, which is important from the point of view of those conducting research. The Freedom of Information Bill 2013 states these are personal records. The question concerning the compatibility of the two was the point I was making. The main point at issue here is that citizens can access the records.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The second point is that the terms of reference have not been finalised for the inquiry which will be the subject of debate here tomorrow. Records will form a big aspect of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The National Archives has 70,000 boxes of files that have not been catalogued. That in its own way produces an access issue. There are even records that people do not know exist that have the potential to complete the jigsaw. Has the Minister had any input in the terms of reference on some of the records that may well impact on this legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_239">A significant volume of statistical data is published in the Ombudsman’s annual report. All the statistics Deputy McDonald is seeking are published there. This can be refined. I had a discussion with the Information Commissioner during the week about the implications of this legislation. I believe it will be warmly embraced and more data will become available.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I do not know what is on the mind of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection regarding the matter raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy. The terms of reference for the inquiry, which do not pertain to this legislation, will not be discussed tomorrow because they are not yet finalised. They will be in the autumn because we want as inclusive a discussion on that matter as is possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I move amendment No. 15:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_251">In page 14, line 21, after “services” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_252">“and contract for services in this definition includes an administrative arrangement between an FOI body and another person”.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">It was always intended that this Bill would provide that Bus Éireann school transport services, carried out on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, would be subject to freedom of information. This was discussed on Committee Stage in some detail. I advised then that the service would be covered within six months of enactment through the restoration of the application of freedom of information to records held by service providers, in so far as the records relate to a service provided for or under contract from the freedom of information body.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> However, a recent High Court case determined the Department of Education and Skills has an administrative arrangement with Bus Éireann rather than a contract. I have provided, therefore, for an amendment to the definition of “service provider” in section 2 to ensure Bus Éireann school transport services will be covered by freedom of information in accordance with the new determination of the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> My amendment addresses Deputy Sean Fleming’s amendments Nos. 22 and 99. I hope he will not move them for that reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Regarding the Deputy’s amendment No. 40, it would not be possible to provide a list of bodies which might provide services under contract to a freedom of information body in the future. It was not deemed necessary to provide such a list under the 1997 Act. I am not aware that any difficulty has arisen in the intervening period in providing up-to-date access to such records, even though they were restricted by the 2002 amending legislation. I do not believe the amendment is necessary.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_257">The Minister said the High Court stated there is an administrative arrangement between the Department of Education and Skills and Bus Éireann, as opposed to a contract. Will the Minister explain what this entails?</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I have learned something new today and it is a good day when one learns something new. Why can the Department of Social Protection not have a similar administrative arrangement with An Post for social welfare payments? I suspect these type of administrative arrangements do not have to go through tendering. This would get rid of the argument that a contract must be put out to tender. The High Court has opened up an interesting vista. While I am looking for the best price for the taxpayer, I would be concerned about administrative arrangements because they cannot be appealed as they are not a statutory process. Is value for money obtained if these are not put out to tender? Will the Minister send us a note on administrative arrangements versus contracts from a public expenditure viewpoint?</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Amendment No. 40 deals with providing a list of service providers under section 10(9). I know it would be difficult to compile such as a list as it would be a rolling issue due to changes in contractors over time. I accept there would be practical difficulties in implementing this amendment. However, take a body such as the Health Service Executive, which has a variety of service providers such as section 38 and section 39 organisations. Some of them have rolling contracts from year to year. We have found that, because they are service providers and the funds are not voted by the Dáil, essentially they are a third party, and even the Committee of Public Accounts cannot compel them to give evidence before it. I am trying to get information on these bodies through freedom of information as it is taxpayers’ money in the end. There are 25 section 39 bodies getting over €5 million each from the State per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The money is voted by the Oireachtas to the HSE but because it goes to the HSE we - even the Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Health and Children - are precluded from holding to account the bodies who receive the money. I am trying to reverse the position now in order that we could get some information from those bodies through FOI.</p>

In due course, when the changes are implemented we will be able to access information from all of those bodies through FOI, and obtain all the information we have not been able to get heretofore. That is progress. We should publicise the changes, which are good. I tabled a number of amendments, which are grouped together. Do I have time to speak on them?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I apologise to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for speaking across you. It is intended that where there is a contract of service or an administrative arrangement between a body and a public body, it will be subject to FOI. That opening to which Deputy Fleming referred will be available once the legislation is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I must put on my legal hat to respond to what is the difference between a contract of service and an administrative arrangement. I will give the Deputy the detail if he is interested. Originally I brought to the Government and it approved the restoration of the 1997 situation that was undone in the 2003 Act, which took school transport out of the system. I put it back, or at least I thought I had until the High Court judgment by Mr. Justice Brian McGovern. The question arose in a case was whether Bus Éireann school transport operations would in fact be covered by the provision due to the finding that the arrangement between the Department of Education and Skills and Bus Éireann was an administrative arrangement and not a contract within the meaning of Council Directive 2004/18/EC relating to public service contracts and the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Specifically, if one asked me the difference between a contract of service and an administrative arrangement, I am afraid one would have to go to a legal adviser for that, but I wanted to make sure whatever the situation, it was captured and for this reason I refer in the amendment to both contracts and administrative arrangements.</p>

It is also to ensure that any exemptions applying to bodies included in Schedule 1 extend to subsidiaries of such bodies controlled directly or indirectly by such bodies. The amendment is being proposed on foot of legal advice that it was necessary to make clear the provision regarding subsidiaries of bodies. I had proposed amendments on those lines on Committee Stage but withdrew them because of the drafting which proved to be quite complex. I went back to the Parliamentary Counsel to get a refined draft and that is what I offer to the House now. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel took the opportunity to restructure the section to make it clearer and easier to follow. In essence, that where the parent body is in then all its subsidiaries are in and where it is out then all its subsidiaries are out.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I thank the Minister for clarifying the issue. I had made a note to ask how it dovetails with Ervia, the new fancy name for Bord Gáis, of which Irish Water is a subsidiary. Bord Gáis Éireann is an exempt agency. Schedule I of the Act deals with exempt agencies. I refer to page 75 of the Act. Irish Water is a subsidiary of an exempt agency. The Minister has already agreed to make Irish Water subject to FOI, but not the parent company. The situation does not appear to work in reverse. I understand it is a different process.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The amendment has limited merit. I note that Bord na Móna is an exempt agency. I accept it is a commercial entity. One of its subsidiaries is AES, which is one of the biggest waste collection companies. There is no point in saying subsidiaries of companies are included if the parent body is an exempt agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> When I was going through my notes on the Bill I was struck by the fact that the legislation is simple but it is very complicated to read. I have gone through it and noted the definitions for public bodies, prescribed bodies, partially included agencies, exempt agencies, enactments excluded from the Act in respect of bodies which are included in the Act, or enactments specifically included, non-disclosure enactments, exempt records and an entire section dealing with restrictions on the Act to records in terms of various types of organisations. I understand the situation outlined by the Minister in a case where the parent company is not an exempt body, partially exempt or covered by the enactments excluded, a non-disclosure enactment, an exempt record or a body whose records are subject to certain restrictions under the Act. That is good. However, a fair amount of people are excluded. It is good that subsidiaries are included, in so far as FOI applies to any body. I am sure there are more bodies, records and exemptions included but following a cursory glance I wondered how one would explain the situation, which is quite complicated. The intention of what the Minister said is good but it is quite limited.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">I think the first sentence spoken by the Deputy was correct. He said this is simple but sounds complicated. The legal structures of many bodies in receipt of funds from the State coffers mean I must deal with them in a clear legal way. I wanted to cast the blanket as widely as possible, subject to a few caveats that include commercial activities that will be dealt with in some amendments later, including amendment No. 102 relating to Ervia. It is important that we do not stymie commercial State companies in their operations. Deputy Sean Fleming mentioned Advanced Environmental Solutions, AES, which operates in a competitive market with many serious players, though I could say more about some of the companies operating in the waste management sector. I do not think an onerous new open reporting burden should be placed on State companies that is not placed on their commercial counterparts because this could give the latter access to information commercially damaging to the State companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I support State enterprises and I want them to be treated separately but apart from this the FOI blanket is thrown over almost everything else, except narrow areas relating to the security of the State and international relations. I think the Deputy will recognise this.</p>

          <p eId="para_303"> Amendment No. 23 deals with receivers and administrators working for or on behalf of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. We are talking about people with service contracts or administrative arrangements with a State body. I presume the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, was excluded but I think it should be listed as a partially-included agency, based on its administrative functions. We all agree that there are matters of commercial sensitivity but aspects of the work of these organisations are not related to commercial sensitivity, especially work carried out by receivers and administrators on their behalf. This applies to NAMA to some extent but I am trying to capture other bodies that might, as mentioned by the Minister, utilise people providing contracts for services or administrative arrangements. Will the work of receivers and administrators for the National Asset Management Agency fall under this freedom of information legislation when it passes?</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Amendment No. 79 deals with the Office of the President and restricted bodies and this point has been well made. Amendment No. 103 seeks the removal of the Food Safety Promotion Board from the list of exempt bodies, though the Minister will say it is a North-South body. I think we need to address the issue of North-South bodies. The Food Safety Promotion Board would not be restricted if it was a 26-county body and would be open to FOI requests. Food safety and traceability are very important issues and I am sure those in the Northern Ireland Assembly agree. I do not know whether FOI legislation from Northern Ireland or Westminster covers this but I do not believe the view on this would be much different. I suggest a co-ordinated approach to FOI for cross-Border bodies be adopted at the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_307"> Amendment No. 105 deals with Tourism Ireland and amendment No. 106 seeks to remove Waterways Ireland from the list of exempt bodies, though I know there is a North-South dimension. Perhaps discussions are underway to bring about these changes because there is a lacuna in the legislation where matters that should be subject to FOI scrutiny are exempt due to a North-South dimension.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">These are all Deputy Sean Fleming's amendments addressing issues that were debated on Committee Stage. I have not changed my mind on the Office of the President as the tradition that the President is above politics and outside the fray is accepted. I considered the amendment but will not accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Amendments Nos. 21 and 105 relate to Tourism Ireland while amendment No. 103 relates to the Food Safety Promotion Board. Amendment No. 106 applies to Waterways Ireland. Tourism Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board and Waterways Ireland were established under the British-Irish Agreement of 1999 and were given statutory effect in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999. Tourism Ireland was established separately under the framework of the British-Irish Agreement. These bodies all operate under a code of practice on access to information that has been approved by the North-South Ministerial Council. The code is based on the FOI legislation in both Ireland and the UK and its primary objective is to facilitate public access to information held by these bodies. There is an administrative arrangement analogous to FOI for these bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Regarding amendment No. 23, concerning whether receivers and administrators appointed by NAMA or another secured lender fall outside the definition of a public body as set out in section 6 of the Bill, the receiver or administrator is an independent legal officer appointed to take control of and realise the assets secured by a loan. The receiver or administrator acts as the legal agent of and for the benefit of the borrower and not the lender or secured creditor. The receiver or administrator's costs are borne by the receivership and not by the lender. Accordingly, I am advised it would not be appropriate to define receivers and administrators as public bodies and, therefore, the amendment is not accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I will not labour this point and I do not wish to personalise the matter but this is not a matter of the Oireachtas encroaching on the functions of the Office of the President. It is a public office, the holder of the position is elected by the people of Ireland and long may this continue to be the case. I feel when people elect a person to an office they are entitled to know what goes on there and I suspect the current President, along with former and future Presidents, would not object to this amendment. I will not press the amendment because I do not wish to be seen as interfering but I feel the Office of the President would be open to this and would welcome it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_323">Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of 26 disability and caring-focused organisations which had their money cut in its entirety under the grand scheme for national and community organisations. The impact of this has been devastating on the organisations concerned. Orla Hardiman spoke this morning on behalf of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. Chris Macey, the chairperson of the organisation, has written to us to state all 11 organisations in the Neurological Alliance of Ireland have lost their money in its entirety. This alliance, which advocates for 700,000 people with neurological conditions, will face closure by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I do not know whether the Taoiseach saw the clips on RTE yesterday with Christy Clarke from Drimnagh who has Huntington's disease. His wife Anne outlined very succinctly the challenges they face on a daily basis. With €26,000 a year the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland is in the position to provide a service for people with this very degenerative condition. This money has been taken from it. The Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, Chronic Pain Ireland and Multiple Sclerosis Ireland have also been affected, as have other such organisations which, for the past six years, have received funding through the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Something happened here and there was a recalibration of the scheme. I have done a bit of work on this. The feedback to the organisations is interesting. Pobal had no issue with the organisations themselves and how they went about their governance and work. It seems the criteria were changed, or the feedback was to such effect that one might be a better fit elsewhere or that one did not fit the particular criteria. This sums up the point I was trying to make yesterday. Interestingly, yesterday evening the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, stated to the Members of the House during an exchange that she was not informed about this decision by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Up to now 50% of the recipients of the scheme were disability and health organisations. Overnight this has been changed to one in eight. Clearly the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government decided somebody else should be funding these organisations and they cut them but did not tell anybody in government about it. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, acknowledged this yesterday evening, which goes to the heart of the lack of cross-cutting co-ordination.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Will the Taoiseach ensure full transparency and publish the recommendations made by Pobal to the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on who should get funding? Will he also publish the Department's response? The appeals mechanism is somewhat vague because Pobal can only state whether an appeal is valid and it is up to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to find the money. The Government should find €1 million to sort out this mess. Otherwise 25 organisations doing invaluable work in the community will be homeless and without any basic resources to keep going. From a humanitarian perspective will the Taoiseach intervene and do what is right and provide €1 million to underpin the appeals process?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_165">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_327">The Deputy has asked me to ensure full transparency and obtain the Department's response and I will. The funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations. The funding scheme began in 2011 and was due to expire in December 2013. It was then extended to the end of June this year with a new scheme to commence from 1 July this year with an overall budget of €8 million. During 2013, officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government carried out a review of the scheme, as the Deputy pointed out. This review found the scheme has fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of their services. The review recommended that organisations be required to clearly demonstrate the added value of the work proposed. The effective use of core funding in recipient organisations also requires that proper governance and proper cost control procedures are in place in the organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The new scheme was advertised for applications during the first quarter of the year. Pobal was asked to undertake an assessment of the applications received and this process, from submission of applications to notification of successful applicants, took place during the first and second quarters of the year. As the Deputy knows, Pobal has significant experience in carrying out these assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> It is true to say a large number of the applicant organisations sought the maximum level of funding available or, in some cases, an amount in excess of the maximum funding available. As a result the number of organisations which could potentially be funded within the budget available was lower than for previous schemes. The Deputy always asks for more money to be put into something. The beginning of problems in other areas for many years was to throw money at a situation and hope it would go away. To make the funding available to as many organisations as possible in these difficult circumstances the situation was assessed and allocations were announced last week, on 3 July. A total of 157 applications were made and received by Pobal. Of these, three did not meet the basic eligibility criteria. The remaining 154 applications were assessed and appraised against the criteria as outlined in the application guidance. A total of 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Pobal has put in place a dedicated team to deal with all inquiries from applicants and provide detailed feedback to applicants, which was the point of the Deputy's first question. There is also an appeals process and Pobal has provided detailed information to applicants on this process. The appeals process is now live and I advise the organisations mentioned by the Deputy and others to use the appeals process because they will receive all of the detailed information from Pobal. Some of the organisations which received money were Barnardos, which received €169,000, and the Children's Rights Alliance, Cherish Limited and Dublin Travellers Education Development, which each received €175,000. All of these have been published. The answer to the Deputy's question is we will ensure full transparency and a departmental response. I suggest to Deputy Martin that organisations such as those he mentioned, which do very good work, have detailed information available to them in regard to the appeal process from Pobal and they should use it.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">This is the appeals document. Appeals were meant to be received in May 2014, but obviously the local elections took place and the grants were not announced until after the elections for obvious reasons. The Taoiseach did not want this out before the local selections because there would have been hell to pay if these 26 organisations knew then. At the end of the appeals document it is stated that all Pobal will do is recommend whether an appeal is valid, after which it will go to the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a final and binding decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> A total of 26 organisations are affected and they are all in one sector, namely, disability and health. The Irish Deaf Society has been affected. It must close its Deaf Forward advocacy services because of this. All the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland would need to keep going is €25,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">That is what we are talking about here. Someone somewhere took a decision to take out these organisations in recalibrating the criteria. They told nobody in the Department of Health. The former Minister, Deputy Hogan, did not tell the former Minister for Health or the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for disability, which is a basic thing to do in terms of crosscutting issues and co-ordination of disability. She said last night that she was not told. It is a mess. It is more than a mess; it is very wrong to do it to organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> This is a very low level of funding in any event. It is money whose multiplier effect is important. In some instances, it enables them to put stamps on the envelopes and keep an office going. It affects organisations such as Chronic Pain Ireland, the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland, the Migraine Association of Ireland and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland. This needs ministerial intervention. The Taoiseach should get the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, around the table in order to take these organisations out of their agony and give them the prospect of closure. It needs to be sorted out before the end of the month to ensure €1 million is available either through the appeals or through the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> Something happened in the dynamic between Pobal and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that resulted in the decision to take these organisations out and to leave somebody else look after them. Somebody dropped the ball and nobody is looking after them now. It is unfair and wrong, and the Taoiseach should intervene to sort it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The appointment of two Ministers with responsibility for the Gaeltacht who do not have functioning Irish is a backward step. I make no criticism of either Minister. I have worked with the Minister of State, an Teachta McHugh, who has played a very positive role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I am sure that both he and an tAire, an Teachta Heather Humphreys, are very capable representatives. Mar sin, nílim ag tabhairt amach faoi na Teachtaí seo go pearsanta.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> However, the appointments and the manner in which the Department has been reorganised provide further evidence of the downgrading of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht that has been the mark of this Government. Dhá bhliain ó shin, bhrúigh an Rialtas an Bille Gaeltachta tríd an Dáil, cé nach raibh aon duine sásta leis. An cuimhin leis an Taoiseach gur shiúl an Freasúra amach as an Dáil nuair a chuaigh an Bille tríd. Freisin, bhí na grúpaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta thar a bheith míshásta leis an mBille.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Gaeltacht communities have been stripped of their right to democratic representation on Údarás na Gaeltachta. There is another quango which is not representative of the people of the Gaeltacht areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> I Mí na Nollag seo caite, d'éirigh an Coimisinéir Teanga ag an am, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, as a phost. Dúirt sé ag an am sin go raibh sin déanta aige mar nach raibh sé sásta le polasaí teanga an Rialtais. Dúirt sé go raibh an Stát ag obair in éadan na ndualgas a bhí air faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Taoiseach's decisions have increased the marginalisation of the Irish language and the public administrative system. The decision to merge the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga with the Office of the Ombudsman and the insufficient resources are further evidence of the disregard the Government has for the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Tá grúpaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta dearg le fearg faoi seo. Labhair mé leis an Taoiseach cúpla uair cheana faoi na daoine óga agus aosta atá ag iarraidh a ngnáth saol a mhaireachtáil trí Ghaeilge. Tá a fhios ag an Rialtas gurb ionann tír le teanga agus tír le hanam. In light of the criticism of the Taoiseach's appointments, will he now reconsider the allocation of these posts and ensure that at least one of the two Ministers with responsibility for the Gaeltacht areas has working Irish?</p>

However, I am compelled to raise again some of the issues regarding the dispute in Dublin city between the waste management company, Greyhound, and its workforce, which now has been locked out for more than four weeks as this dispute is now in its fifth week. I understand there has been communication between the workers' union, SIPTU, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to arranging a meeting to discuss the serious problems in the waste management industry as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I wish to repeat the point I made during Leaders' Questions two weeks ago, which is that there is an urgent need for an inquiry into pay and working conditions, issues of training, health and safety, maintenance of vehicles, storage of waste and general compliance with environmental regulations and local authority by-laws. This inquiry must involve all the agencies tasked with supervision, namely, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the local authorities, the Irish Waste Management Association and the workers. Is the Taoiseach aware whether this is going ahead and whether this is being driven by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation? That Minister must now examine seriously the need for an employment rights order for this industry. There is intense competition between the companies to cut costs and maximise profits at the expense of wages and proper working conditions in the drive towards competition for the market. If employers get their way, this will become a minimum wage, minimum rights industry with huge implications for health and safety for those working in it. Moreover, a crucial service for public health and the environment is in the hands of cowboy employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Does the Taoiseach not consider it to be deplorable that in a modern society, 100 years after the infamous 1913 Lock-out in Dublin, an employer, namely, Greyhound, is prepared to use the same brutal methods to try to crush a unionised workforce? This was a well planned and organised assault by the Buckley brothers by bringing in security on the day and by using so-called agency workers. One of the so-called agencies in-sourced hired operatives at the minimum wage of €8.65 per hour and the main scab organiser, Calin Bogdan, is not a licensed employment agent.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">There has been some commentary about NERA's involvement in this company and its employees. While Deputy Joan Collins is aware the authority acts utterly independently in these matters, it is its practice to instigate investigations where there are allegations of breaches of employment rights legislation, as would be appropriate for it to do. There have also been calls generally for a Government task force to investigate the operation of the sector as a whole. I am aware that in his response yesterday to the general secretary of SIPTU, the Minister noted that being mindful that the need for proper compliance with legislation is in the workers' and the wider public interest, he is seeking reports from the relevant agencies under his Department, that is, the Health and Safety Authority, the National Employment Rights Authority, the National Consumer Agency, the Competition Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and on the operation of the wider sector itself. This work has commenced and will be concluded as a matter of some urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> In respect of State workers, under the Employment Agency Act 1971, the employment agency must hold a licence if it is to carry on its business and NERA's workplace relations licensing section is responsible for issuing employment agency licences. It is a matter for NERA to oversee the operation of the employment legislation in this regard. SIPTU has written to the Minister alleging that a company is providing agency workers to Greyhound, which is displacing its members and sustaining the lock-out and that the company in question is not registered on the list of licensed employment agencies. That is a matter for the relevant section in NERA to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Obviously, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, launched a consultation paper in November 2013. It received 91 submissions which are being considered and evaluated. In the immediate term, I urge everybody concerned to avail of the facilities of the State mechanism for dealing with this, in order that the dispute might be brought to an end.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply but there is a certain urgency to this because those workers have been locked out for five weeks without a cent in their pockets. All Members of this House will rise on Thursday in the knowledge that their wages will be paid into their bank accounts on Friday week and again in August. These workers have no sense of security that they will go back into the Labour Court. It is where they want to go and I seek a strong indication from the Taoiseach that he is calling on Greyhound to enter into the Labour Relations Commission talks without the threat of a 35% wage cut and that those workers are back at work. That is where they should be as they want to do their work. That is what must be done for this to go ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">Deputy Joan Collins has raised a fundamentally important point here, which is that workers are without wages for five weeks. I acknowledge that Deputy Dowds met the workers last week. This dispute must be resolved but it will not be resolved with the current impasse. The way it can be resolved is to use the mechanisms of the State that are available to both sides. The Government desires a resolution and the way it must be resolved, like all other disputes, is to use these mechanisms and come to an agreement in order that work can be under way again and workers can receive their wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I ask everybody concerned on both sides to use these facilities. That is what they are for and they have been tried and tested in very serious cases over the years and have always proved beneficial in bringing about a conclusion. I suggest strongly that they be applied. The licensing section of the National Employment Rights Authority will deal with the allegation concerning unlicensed operations as such issues are the responsibility of NERA.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> I hope this matter can be brought to a conclusion. It is not good that workers have been left without wages for five weeks. The dispute needs to be settled and can be settled and the mechanisms of the State will be beneficial in achieving that.</p>

I often feel sorry for some of the restaurant staff because the requests Deputies make from time to time do not always conform to the wishes of the chef and kitchen staff.

          <p eId="para_459">On the medical reform Bill, the Government did a U-turn on discretionary medical cards and the Taoiseach, speaking on the Order of Business last week, indicated that the Government would provide general practitioner visit cards to everybody aged over 70 years. Approximately 50,000 people aged over 70 do not have a GP visit card or medical card. I understand legislation will be required to provide this group with GP visit cards. When can we expect the relevant legislation? Will it provide for those aged over 70 years who have lost their medical cards, particularly those with serious illnesses who cannot apply for a discretionary medical card using the over 70s income thresholds and must do so using the under 70s income thresholds? This anomaly is catching many seriously ill older people. I dealt with some horrific cases last week. What is the position regarding the medical reform Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> On the medical practitioners (medical indemnity insurance) Bill, the purpose of which is to ensure all medical practitioners have adequate medical indemnity insurance, the Minister may be aware that there is a crisis in indemnity, particularly for consultants in private hospitals. Premiums have increased by 50%, with the Medical Protection Society charging premiums of €90,000 for consultants in the orthopaedic and spinal areas. Many Deputies have been contacted about this serious issue. When can we expect the legislation given the urgency of the situation and the crisis in cover for key specialties in the private hospital sector?</p>

The medical card legislation to which the Deputy refers is for the next session, subject to the policy advice of the new Minister for Health. The health insurance Bill to which the Deputy refers is for discussion in Cabinet next Tuesday or Wednesday, as the case may be. </p>

          <p eId="para_463">Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur maidir leis an nGarda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014. The House has discussed a number of scandals recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">There are a number of measures that the Minister intends to introduce in the forthcoming Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill. The Cabinet agreed the heads of that Bill on 1 July. Is it intended to put that before the committee in the pre-legislative stage or, due to the amount of debate that has already been held on it, is it intended to publish it and encourage the Dáil to start work on it as quickly as possible to try to help rebuild morale within An Garda Síochána and those institutions that have been caught in much of the scandal and debate so far?</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The second issue concerns the referendum on Article 41.2.1o, as proposed by the Constitutional Convention which discussed this matter in February 2013. This is to try to make the Constitution gender neutral as regards what is called the "woman in the home" clause. Is it intended, as has been said, to have the proposed referendum dealing with this issue at the same time, next spring, as the Government is hoping to have the referendum on marriage equality?</p>

          <p eId="para_466">No date has yet been fixed for that particular referendum. I understand that the heads of the Garda Síochána (amendment) Bill were cleared in July. If the timeline permitted, we would like it to go to a pre-legislative stage but, as the Deputy's question suggests, it is a matter of urgency. If time is available, we would like to enact it in the next session, preferably after a pre-legislative stage.</p>

There is a need to address deficiencies that exist between landlords and tenants, including deficiencies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board. In south Kildare currently, a private tenant is renting from a landlord who does not live in the area. There are also serious anti-social behaviour issues. Neighbours who have been greatly impacted upon by this are not party to the tenancy and do not seem to have any form of redress.</p>

The Children First guidelines formed a key piece of legislation promised by the Government when it assumed office.

          <p eId="para_521">It is too early to say that the personal insolvency legislation is not working. It is certainly effective in terms of the number of people who are now applying for bankruptcy. In regard to restructuring loans, it does not yet seem to be dealing with a large quantum of impaired loans but we are in the early days of its operation. I suggest that in the first instance the appropriate committee of the House to examine progress may be the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. I am sure the Minister for Justice and Equality is open to suggestions from that committee on amendments which might improve the efficacy of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">The legislation promoted by the Government in respect of the property tax provided an option for local authorities to vary the tax up or down by 15%. However, the statutory instrument to which my colleague, Deputy Cowen, referred was published on 5 February without fanfare. It was not even accompanied by the usual press release. The effect of the statutory instrument is to make it virtually impossible for local authorities to vary the property tax in the current year.

            <p eId="para_526">I thank the Minister for taking this issue. I congratulate her on her new position and wish her well in future. School staffing, pupil-teacher ratios and classroom size have always been particularly emotive issues, especially for smaller schools, as they relate to children's education and young children in the case of primary schools. The emotion is not just confined to parents, who want their children to get the best possible education, as it also involves staff and teachers in schools. Teachers in small schools build quite a rapport with the community, including parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> The criteria for dealing with the allocation of teaching posts are set out clearly in the staffing circular 007/2014. As a result of these criteria, 39 small schools will lose a teacher next September, and there is a particular reference to budgetary measures in 2012. I am from a country school which had three teachers and I have seen a change in the manner in which teachers deal with the curriculum now. It is much tougher and there is much more work involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> Based on a drop in figures last year, schools will lose teachers this year. I will give the example of Meath Hill school in my constituency, where this emotive issue has become evident. It seems illogical that a school with an increasing number of students this year is set to lose a teacher based on last year's figures. Last year, student numbers dropped to 78, which I agree is a significant drop, but the enrolment for this year is 87. Last year was the first in which the school increased the number of teachers to four and much time and effort has been spent building up the school. For it to lose a teacher this year, when student numbers have increased and will do so again next year, is illogical. In the school, one teacher will now have to take first, second and third class together, as junior and senior infants have their own special classroom that has been built. It is very difficult to split fifth and sixth classes, which usually stay together, so the decision was made for first, second and third class to stay together. That means a total of 37 students under nine will be in one classroom, which raises serious concerns. This is not the only matter for a teacher, who will find it difficult to keep an eye on 37 students under nine, as the curriculum has changed and there is much more work involved. There is a serious health and safety issue because we are talking about large classes in small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> There has been an appeal and in this case I was informed that if student numbers had only dropped to 80 last year, the appeal outcome would have been positive. I am not sure I see the difference between having 78 students and 80 students. The school is losing a teacher based on last year's student numbers. I would appreciate if the Minister could consider the issue, as the process seems illogical. I look forward to her response.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Jan O'Sullivan)<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_530">I thank Deputy McEntee for her good wishes and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position relating to staffing in primary schools. I note the issues raised by the Deputy. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools are published annually on the Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools. It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS band 1 schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The staffing schedule also includes the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for the following September, which is September 2014 in the case of the coming school year. The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools which are due to lose a teacher. Affected schools can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board. Details of the appeal criteria are available in the staffing schedule, which is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills. The primary staffing appeals board meets three times per year and the board operates independently of the Minister and the Department. Its decision is final. In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level has been extended for the coming school year to allow schools not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> The allocation of all teaching posts is contingent on compliance with redeployment arrangements. The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies. The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. The staffing arrangements enable projected enrolments to be taken into account in the case of small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget 2012 measure mentioned by the Deputy and schools that are experiencing significant increase in their pupil enrolments. The Department regards this approach as reasonable and appropriate. It would not be practical or logistically possible to successfully operate the teacher allocation and redeployment process if there is any further expansion of this approach regarding projected enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. School authorities are advised in the staffing schedule to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account, such as classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment, etc. In particular, they should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">I note the school the Deputy referred to and the issue concerning small schools. It is a very transparent system, one that people understand and the appeal system is independent. We need to keep all those factors in the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">I thank the Minister for her response. It is important that people know it is an independent process and I accept it is. This removes any illusion that people can interfere in the process and I welcome that. I find it illogical, however, that a school, which for the first time received its fourth teacher last year, is losing one this year. I find it hard to explain that to parents, and rightly so. When the number increases from 78 to 87, that should be reconsidered. We appealed twice under two different criteria. I would appreciate it if the Minister could look into how this is addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">I hear what the Deputy says. I have not been in this job for very long. The system deals with all kinds of schools around the country and it is very important that it is transparent and seen to be fair, and that there is an appeal system. The appeal system does particularly take account of the small primary schools the Deputy is talking about. Where possible, I will ensure that there is fairness all round and that the issues the Deputy raises are taken into account.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_537">I wish my constituency colleague, the new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, well in his new post. If the Minister for Education and Skills has a moment to spare, this issue crosses over into her remit and I would appreciate if she could bear with us.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> As the school holidays kick in and staff and students take a well-earned rest after another school year, this is an opportune time to take stock and begin planning for the upcoming school year. We must also acknowledge that there are children all over the country in primary and secondary schools who are still in education due in no small part to the school completion programme, SCP. The programme was set up as part of the Department of Education and Skills’s delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, strategy. Its aim is to increase the numbers of young people staying in primary and secondary school and in doing so to improve the numbers of pupils who successfully complete the senior cycle or the equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> The SCP operates in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools. There are 124 local school completion projects employing 248 full-time, 627 part-time and 2,211 sessional and other staff. It focuses on targeting and providing supports to young people most at risk of early school-leaving. It involves identifying and supporting children at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of poor attendance, participation and retention. It does this via initiatives such as breakfast clubs, homework clubs, after-school supports, mentoring programmes and therapeutic interventions. The programme works to ensure the schools have in place the appropriate procedures to monitor, identify and respond to attendance, participation and retention issues. One key potential crisis point for any vulnerable child is the move from primary to secondary school. The SCP works to implement transfer programmes to support young people making that transition.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> The SCP is highly valuable but it does not seem to be highly valued. The scheme targets vulnerable children most at risk of falling out of education. I have spoken to SCP officers who deal with very difficult situations, such as children of families who cannot afford new shoes, or to purchase uniforms. Many children in this programme would not have breakfast before going to school, nor would they have a packed lunch in their bags or money to buy lunch. They do not have money for school books in many cases. Many deal with difficult circumstances at home. It is therefore vital that these children are given every support to stay in education. The scheme has been cut by approximately 33% since 2008. There are concerns about a further 6.5% cut this September. I ask that any cuts due to be implemented this coming school year be halted until the current programme review of the SCP has been completed. An answer I received to a parliamentary question put in May to the previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs stated: </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_541">It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to educational outcomes for pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">My concern and that of SCP officers is that this review will further reduce the role of the SCP without putting in place any kind of replacement scheme. Will the Minister urgently examine the potential reductions in funding for the SCP before the summer ends with a view to putting a halt to any cut due for the upcoming school year? The review is taking place and it is only fair that no further cuts hit the scheme before it is finalised.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_543">I thank my constituency colleague for raising this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> The school completion programme, SCP, aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve their school attendance, participation and their retention in education. The SCP is a targeted intervention, aimed at those school communities which are identified through the Department of Education and Skills's DEIS action plan for educational inclusion. The programme involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives which operate across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools. It provides targeted supports to some 36,000 children and young people who may be at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> The projects within the SCP are each managed and directed by a local management committee, which includes representatives of schools, parents, and other education stakeholders in the locality. The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. Typically, projects offer homework clubs; breakfast clubs; mentoring programmes; learning support; social and personal development programmes to young people; and out of school supports, including music, art and sports and a range of activities during holiday periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> As with all major spending programmes, the SCP budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE. This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014. In 2014, an allocation of €24.756 million has been provided for the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> Since its establishment, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the SCP, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. The process involves local projects developing annual school retention plans with detailed service proposals for the forthcoming school year and the determination of the allocations to be provided on that basis and having regard to the CRE savings requirements. I have been advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the agency for the funding for SCP projects in the coming 2014-2015 academic year. As an initial step the agency invited all SCP projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. The agency has commenced the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014-15 school retention plans for individual projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">It anticipates that local projects will be notified of the outcome of the process and of their allocations for the 2014-15 year in advance of the start of the new school year. The agency will continue to work closely with local management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process. The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the Estimates and the budgetary process, having regard to the resources available to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme has commenced. The review is an important initiative in the planning of the future development of the school completion programme. The objectives of the review are to identify best practice in the provision of support to children and young people to assist their retention in school, to clarify roles and responsibilities in the programme and to build on the valuable learning and experience acquired to date. It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and to ensure available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014-15 academic year.</p>

            <p eId="para_550">I thank the Minister for his reply. Labour Party Deputies have fought hard to protect funding and support for schools participating in the DEIS programme. When cuts were announced in previous budgets, we successfully fought to have them reversed. The Minister was at the Cabinet table at that time and was party to such positive outcomes. The cuts to the school completion programme represent an under-the-radar cut to schools involved in the DEIS programme and, crucially, to DEIS pupils. We need to see these cuts halted and ultimately reversed. There is an economic recovery under way. It is slow but it is happening. People will want to see that recovery being reflected in their pockets, but it will also need to be measured in other ways, for example by reference to the manner in which we protect and support vulnerable people in our society and help those who have been let down by this country's passive system of social inclusion, education and welfare. These are very important measures from the perspective of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> The school completion programme is an important scheme that provides real help for children who need it. If we protect and support it now, our young people and by extension our communities will benefit from it into the future. Given that a review of the programme is under way, would it not be prudent to await the outcome and the recommendations coming from that process before the further cuts proposed for September 2014 are made? That is the essential point of today's debate. It is not an expensive scheme, but it has an invaluable impact on vulnerable children in terms of keeping them in education and ultimately offering them a more secure path in life. I believe the resources for this scheme should be ring-fenced. I am willing to argue that point with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform if the Minister feels there is value in so doing and that it would assist him in his own efforts.</p>

            <p eId="para_552">I thank the Deputy for his expressions of support for this important programme. We know that any money invested in children yields the biggest return, regardless of whether it is spent in health, in education or on an important educational scheme like this one. This programme is aimed at the most vulnerable people, including those likely to leave education before they have had an opportunity to benefit fully from it. The review is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials from the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills and the Child and Family Agency. The Minister for Education and Skills was with us a few minutes ago. The review is being carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute following a procurement process that was managed by the agency. Rather than cutting any services, the review will look at areas where moneys can be saved and efficiencies can be put in place. Obviously, we have to be wise to the fact that there have been some reductions already. I will of course discuss this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy Howlin.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">Ba mhaith liom sa chéad áit mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le hoifig an Cheann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a phlé sa Teach inniu. I welcome the opportunity to speak. I appreciate the permission I have been given by the office of the Ceann Comhairle to raise this issue. I would like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on his promotion to the Cabinet and, more importantly, on his appointment as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, which means he has responsibility for road safety. I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister's predecessors in that Department - the Ministers, Deputy Varadkar and Kelly, both of whom helped me when I raised on the floor of the Dáil on numerous occasions the issue of the N71 route in west Cork . I appreciate their assistance. I would also like to wish the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, every good luck in his new role. I look forward to working with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> While this is an old chestnut, it is very important to me and to the people I represent. During the boom years when the so-called Celtic tiger was flowing, the people of west Cork were always amazed to find that they did not seem to exist when decisions were being made on infrastructural projects like schools building and road development. Thankfully, this Government has addressed much of the decline in the schools building area. I am extremely grateful for the substantial school building programme that has taken place, even in these times of very limited finances. However, we have made no progress with the National Roads Authority on the N71. When I was the chair of the western committee of Cork County Council, I led a delegation that met representatives of the authority almost ten years ago. The last time money was spent on the N71 was in 2003, when a 1 km bypass was built around Skibbereen. Although some moneys have been spent on maintenance, etc., nothing serious or worthy of note has been done in the 11 years since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_555"> We have a wonderful product in west Cork. I know the Minister is familiar with the area. Like many Members of the House who like to come to west Cork, he will have enjoyed the product we have down there. We are very proud of what we have to offer. Unfortunately, the N71 access route presents huge challenges, particularly at this time of the year. I say that to provide some background. A number of accidents have taken place at a particular junction and an adjoining stretch of the N71, which is no more than 500 m long. Unfortunately, there have been some extremely tragic fatalities at this location. Most recently, a young girl was fatally injured in a tragic accident at this spot. When such fatalities happen, we are all reminded that we have a duty which goes above and beyond politics and money. It is literally an issue of life and death. There have been four incidents along this 500 m stretch of roadway already this year. There were seven serious incidents involving the fire brigade and some fatalities last year. In 2012,12 official incidents were recorded along this 500 m stretch.</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> The figures are there. The National Roads Authority is well aware of the issue. As public representatives, we want to raise this issue and we have a responsibility to do so. I plead with the Minister, who is responding to his first Topical Issue since he took up this office in recent days, to approach the National Roads Authority and ask it to make direct and proactive contact with Cork County Council. This is a matter of life and death. I am not exaggerating any of the facts, although I wish I was. Too many tragedies have taken place on the tiny stretch of road that needs to be addressed. I will not go into the engineering details of the road on the floor of the Dáil other than to say that two bends need to be removed. I would like the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to ask the National Roads Authority to take a proactive approach. He should also ask Cork County Council to address this issue immediately, irrespective of the demands on its funds and its time. The Minister should be then in a position to confirm to me whether this is a priority for the National Roads Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for his kind comments on my appointment. I am aware that he has been working on and raising this issue for a very long period of time. I understand completely the importance that attaches to the improvement of this route, not only for safety reasons but also because it plays an important role for the Deputy's constituency and the broader country. In light of his involvement in local government and his membership of this House, the Deputy will be aware that the various figures involved in this area have different levels of responsibility. As Minister, I have responsibility for road network funding and policy. The National Roads Authority is responsible for the planning, design and implementation of individual projects. The local authorities deal with all matters relating to traffic management.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> I am aware that tragedies, losses of life and injuries have occurred on or near the location to which the Deputy is referring.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the National Roads Authority undertakes the ranking of our roads on a periodic basis with regard to safety concerns and examines collision data to assess the safety of the area and the road. I understand work on this road was undertaken last year at Bohonagh, which is east of the section of road to which the Deputy refers. </p>
            <p eId="para_560"> The Deputy began and ended his contribution by asking whether I would make contact with the National Roads Authority to ask for a further update on this matter and to determine whether further remedial and safety work should be prioritised for this section of the road. I confirm that I will do that. I appreciate why this is a concern for him, his constituents and the communities who use the road. I will contact the National Roads Authority and ensure that a report and an update is furnished to the Deputy about a matter he has been campaigning on and raising for some time.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I appreciate the Minister's response and the willingness he is showing towards this project. I look forward to working with him. My plea is twofold: the bigger issue of the upgrade of the N71 and the need for political prioritisation. I debated that on the floor of the House with some of the Minister's predecessors in the Department at ministerial level. As politicians, we have an obligation to prioritise issues. We ensure there is provision for collecting the water charges and taxes associated with that, therefore, we must have a say in where the money is spent, and I am determined to see that money come to west Cork. It is long overdue. I do not know what the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government had against west Cork and why, in times of plenty, it decided not to invest a cent in upgrading the N71. Those days are gone. I cannot do anything about that but I can raise it today and I assure the Minister I will be constant in my calls to get funding for the N71 through the NRA, and I would appreciate the support of his good office.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> I will make two points about this stretch of road. As the Minister pointed out, the NRA did some remedial works last year at Bohonagh, in Rosscarbery. Unfortunately, that moves the problem further west because if two bends are taken out and the road widened, motorists approach the next bend faster. That is the problem, and it is the result of years of neglect and lack of investment in the N71. It has to be addressed in the macro sense but in the short term we must deal with remedial works on the approach to Rosscarbery. Rosscarbery is a beautiful village-town, which is very popular. The locals know the stretch of road and, thankfully, there have not been many accidents involving locals but it is a very popular tourist area and people will not be familiar with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> There is a request on the Minister's desk for a deputation from Cork County Council led by my colleague, Councillor Noel O'Donovan, in west Cork to lobby for funding for this project. Such is the depth of anxiety among the people locally to get this issue addressed a farmer has offered to donate his lands, which is an extraordinary gesture. The story was carried in the local newspapers recently. I would not expect any farmer to donate lands but he has offered to donate the land at that stretch of road free of charge to the NRA. That is an indication of the depth of feeling among the local people. It would be remiss of the NRA not to accept that serious offer and be proactive on this issue. I appreciate the Minister's offer to deal with it and look forward to getting a report on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_564">I will respond to the two points the Deputy made about the road itself and the particular section of road to which he referred. Regarding the road itself, I am now engaging in reviewing our capital spending plans, in other words, the money we will spend on roads and other projects for the coming years. There are many priorities and issues that need to be addressed in that regard. The Deputy has long raised the issue of what has happened to the N71, therefore I will take into account the point he made about the broader road and what needs to be looked at, while appreciating that this will be done in the midst of having to make choices with regard to how and where we spend money available for infrastructure. I heard the Deputy clearly about the money needing to be spent in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> On the second point about safety, I will be contacting the National Roads Authority to update it on this debate and ask that it reverts to me, and to the Deputy, with an update on what has happened and whether safety work should be prioritised at the location, and the ranking process to which I referred earlier. I will ensure the Deputy is made fully aware of that. I will ensure also that the National Roads Authority is aware of the extraordinary offer from the farmer in the Deputy's community, which indicates to me how seriously the matter is being taken by the people he represents. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and with regard to the safety matter, I will ensure he is furnished with a report on foot of this debate.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">There is growing outrage across the world at the escalating death toll in Gaza. Gaza, with a population of about 1.8 million Palestinians, is essentially an open air prison. It is a community of people who are dispossessed, moved away from their homeland for decades. They have had to endure that profound injustice but, once again, they are under onslaught. Over 200 people have been killed in recent days, over 80% of whom were civilian women and children. All of us have seen the horrific images coming in every day and almost every hour. I could tell the Minister many stories but the worst has to be the entire family of the Gaza police chief, 19 people, wiped out.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> This is another onslaught by the Israeli state that appears to go unchallenged. I want to know what the Minister, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our Government have done to challenge the Israeli state on its repeated onslaught against the Palestinian people. It is deeply regrettable that rockets are being fired in the other direction but we should be sensible about that. Israel has one of the biggest armies in the world. It has a navy, an air force, nuclear weapons and missile defence systems. It is on a different scale from those in Hamas and other groups who have been launching rockets made within their own territories. This is not a real conflict. It is a genocide against a people.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> What will the Minister do about this issue? Will he call in the Israeli ambassador and represent the view of the Irish people once and for all that this rogue state, which is engaged in repeated acts of terrorism, should be confronted once and for all?</p>

            <p eId="para_569">I too stand in solidarity with the peoples of Palestine and Gaza and express a public condemnation of the ferocious and unwarranted massacre being perpetrated against those people by the Israeli state. I echo the points made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn. The world is looking on in horror and is shocked at the under-represented voice of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> I condemn in some sense the coverage by our national broadcaster, which has tried to portray this conflict as a fight among equals or some sort of civil war when it is genocide. It is like the world heavyweight championship boxer taking on a newborn baby. That is the parallel in terms of the forces at play here. There has been 1,500 attacks on Gaza in the past ten days, 1,500 tonnes of explosives with the majority of casualties being among civilians but we must step back from that. This is not a recent phenomenon, despite the recent escalation. The reality is that the Israeli offensive has been ongoing for some considerable time with the detention of Palestinians at an unacceptable level and an intrusion in their daily lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> A week or two ago, we had the privilege of meeting here a former member of the Israeli Defence Forces and member of Breaking the Silence who saw, from his own experiences inside the Israeli army, the propaganda that is taught to the Israeli people about the role of the Israeli army. He was quite clear, as indeed that exhibition was, that the Israeli army is an army of occupation and that it is nothing to do with defence. It is an assault on people's living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> I want to know why the State has been so silent. I want an absolute condemnation from the Government of what is going on and a demand for the massacre and bombardment to cease. I want a condemnation of Obama, Hollande and Cameron who have stood shoulder to shoulder with the Israeli state. It is small wonder when they pump in billions of euro, a majority of which is given back to their own arms industry. I want the Minister to let us know what he will do about that and illegal Israeli settlements on the ground in Gaza and Palestine.</p>

            <p eId="para_573">I wish the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, all the best in his new portfolio. No doubt we will have plenty of battles here.</p>
            <p eId="para_574"> To date, more than 200 Palestinians, mostly civilians including women and children, have been killed. In contrast, there has been one fatality on the Israeli side. I do not understand how the Government has stayed so silent. More than 300,000 Palestinians have been asked to move or have been displaced in preparation for an imminent attack. What is happening right now amounts to a massacre, not a war. We should all be concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_575"> Israel claims that it has the right to self-defence, but an occupying power does not have the right to defence. It has an obligation and a duty to protect the civilians under its occupation. Even if it fails to meet that duty, it must abide by humanitarian law and the principles of distinction, proportionality and necessity. It has not abided by any of these.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> What is happening in Gaza amounts to war crimes. It is a repeat of what happened in 2008, 2009 and 2012. We will see this repeated unless Israel is held to account under international humanitarian law and international criminal law. We need responsible governments to introduce sanctions in order to work towards stopping these massacres and to address the root causes of these flare-ups, which is the structural violence of occupation, apartheid and settler colonialism.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> Hamas and other Palestinian leaders are suspicious of the Middle East envoy, Mr. Tony Blair, acting as the link between Israel and Egypt. Blair is clearly a defender of Israel's interests and in the interest of peace, the Government should advocate at European level for the removal of Blair, who should be tried for war crimes for his disgraceful involvement in the Iraq war.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated, "No international pressure will prevent us from acting with all power", claiming to have recently had good conversations with leaders, including US President Obama and EU Heads of Government. Will Ireland also be complicit? Despite that the United Nations top human rights official has called for an investigation into Israeli air strikes in Gaza on the grounds that the targeting of Palestinian homes resulting in a high death toll among civilians, particularly children, violates international law, is there any chance the Government would take a neutral position and highlight how disgraceful the Israeli behaviour is?</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_579">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. The current large-scale violence in and around Gaza was sparked by the dreadful murders of four young people in June and July, but quickly escalated, and has taken on a terrible life of its own. An estimated 1,260 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and west Jerusalem, and at the nuclear reactor at Dimona. Israel, in response, has carried out some 1,750 air strikes on Gaza. These are stated to be aimed at missile launchers and other targets associated with Hamas and other militant groups. However, as is always the case, it seems the resultant casualties, now estimated at approximately 205 dead in Gaza, include large numbers of civilians.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> Israel has stated that it seeks what it describes as "quiet for quiet", that is, a resumption of the truce which has largely held since November 2012. The attitude of Hamas is less clear, but its military wing seems uninterested for the moment in any form of ceasefire. It may be that, having been weakened in a number of ways in recent months, it is seeking to reassert its standing in a military confrontation with Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> It is, however, civilians - women, children and men - especially of Gaza but also of Israel, who suffer the cost of these events. We have all seen with horror the reports of civilians killed, residents evacuating their homes and civilians running for shelters. I share entirely the views expressed by Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly and Mac Lochlainn, and by many members of the public, that this is utterly unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> Our position is clear. This violence, and its cost to civilians, is not acceptable. On taking office I issued a statement on Monday calling for an end to firing by both sides and a restoration of the truce. All Israelis and all Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security without a constant threat of violence. My predecessor, who also made a similar statement on behalf of the Government last week, spoke directly to the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors on Thursday last, and asked them to convey urgently to their authorities our considerable concerns about the situation and our call for restraint, an urgent de-escalation of the crisis, full respect for international humanitarian law and a restoration of the ceasefire. I am glad of the opportunity of this debate to restate the position of the Government quite clearly.</p>
            <p eId="para_583"> I was encouraged by the proposal on the part of the Egyptian Government for a ceasefire to come into effect yesterday, and by the acceptance of this proposal by Israel, which then halted its military operations for a number of hours. Regrettably, missile attacks from Gaza into Israel did not cease, and attacks in both directions are now continuing. There is no indication yet that Hamas is disposed to accept a ceasefire. I hope, none the less, that the Egyptian Government will persevere and that it will be possible to achieve a ceasefire soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> The High Representative, Baroness Catherine Ashton, has made similar calls on behalf of the European Union, as have many of my EU colleagues. The EU Heads of State and Government, at their meeting today, are expected to issue a statement restating those calls. The Foreign Affairs Council next week, which I will attend, will also address the crisis in Gaza and will hopefully have an opportunity to consider the longer-term implications for the peace process of recent developments on the ground and an appropriate EU response.</p>
            <p eId="para_585"> We are, of necessity, focused on achieving an end to the current wave of attacks, but the Government has consistently stressed that until the continuing blockade of Gaza is brought to an end, these cycles of violence are always going to recur. This is a matter to which we will return. I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I am keeping a close eye on the situation. I regard what is happening as utterly unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">The Minister will be aware that a few years ago the European Union, in an important report, heavily condemned Israel for the continued settlements in the West Bank. Essentially, the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza are in an open-air prison. The Palestinian people in the West Bank are occupied. There are between 1 million and 2 million Palestinian refugees based in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, dispossessed from their homes. This is the profound injustice.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> Israel has ignored repeated Security Council resolutions over the years. Only the veto of the United States protects it. When will the international community say that this is a nonsense about a war between Israel and Hamas? This is an utter nonsense. This is no war. This is no fair fight. This is an oppressive bully that has held millions of Palestinians as hostages for all of these decades and that repeatedly is not confronted about its actions.</p>

What is being fired from Gaza is well off the mark, not hitting home and low-key compared to the firepower coming across from the other side. The evidence of that is in the body count. There is nothing on the Israeli side while there is a massive civilian loss on the side of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> The point we are trying to make is that Ireland is a neutral country in the EU. The majority of EU countries bend the knee in slavish adherence to the United States and its colleagues in Israel for their own economic interests. We can be a beacon against that and be the voice of reasoned citizens across Europe declaring this should not continue. We need to do much more.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> I agree with the point about the Israeli ambassador but we need to lead the way with an economic embargo of the settlements and the undermining of all illegal Israeli activity which is behind much of the present conflict.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">Unfortunately, the US and Egypt are happy to see Hamas take a beating. On Monday, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the US was concerned about escalating tensions. On Tuesday he said, "I cannot condemn strongly enough the actions of Hamas". The Minister spoke about both sides behaving themselves. If France invaded Liechtenstein, killed 200 of its inhabitants while only one French person was killed, would we be asking them to behave and make up? No, we would be throwing anything we could at France. What is happening in Gaza is outrageous.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> Everyone knows Hamas’s demands are not ridiculous. It wants the blockade ended, the re-release of 50 prisoners who were recently re-arrested in exchange for an Israeli soldier and the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. If the US continues to defend the indefensible, Israel will continue to behave abysmally. That is no reason why the Irish Government should behave abysmally. Let us call a spade a spade. We need to be seen as a neutral country.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">I recognise that causalities are overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side. I agree with Deputy Mac Lochlainn that it is not credible or possible, however, to address this issue as if only one side were engaged in attacks, something some others have suggested this afternoon.

There are deliveries of food and fuel into Gaza while electricity continues to be supplied from Israel, although, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn will be aware, two of the power lines have been cut by missiles from Gaza.

          <p eId="para_633">The amendment is in the same vein as No. 27, which has fallen. It is a minor issue but it comes back to the exempt bodies. Amendment No. 28 essentially relates to a subsidiary of a public body or where it is unclear whether a body is exempt and No. 27 moves bodies to the exempt list. I thought it would be prudent for the Dáil to have the final say. If it is a recommendation of the Minister, then the Government of the day will carry the vote. There is much good work and welcome changes in the Bill and exempting a body is a serious thing to do. There may be good reasons for so doing but without amendment No. 27, the Minister of the day can essentially add to the list without Dáil oversight. The purpose of amendment No. 28 relates to cases of disagreement where the Minister of the day will decide. It occurred to me that the Information Commissioner would be the right person to decide rather than the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">There is slight confusion. The measure does not allow the Minister to prescribe new bodies; it is to provide a mechanism for bodies that are automatically captured but who might feel they should not be subject to freedom of information and who wish to dispute the case. Both sections 6(5) and 7(5) provide for the Minister to be the final arbiter in a dispute between the Information Commissioner and a public body as to whether the body is covered by the Freedom of Information Act. As the Information Commissioner would obviously be a party to the dispute, he or she could not be the final arbiter in a dispute. If he or she says the body should be included and the body disagrees, he or she cannot say he or she is the deciding authority and provide his or her view. It is better for the Minister, who is the responsible constitutional officer for the Act, to be the decider in such a case. The alternative would be to make it a matter for the courts, but I do not think that is necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">The Deputy is confusing two different issues again. This is simply a provision where the basic fact of whether a body is included or not is in dispute and the dispute is between the body which says it is not covered and the Information Commissioner. I am providing the matter should be determined by the Minister. It mirrors the situation set out in the Ombudsman legislation, which is the same officer, at the suggestion of the then Ombudsman herself.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">I am sorry, I was mixing up my amendments. Amendment No. 29 is very similar to No. 27. No. 27 says a Minister may put a body on the exempt list and amendment No. 29 is about the Minister putting part of a public body on the exempt list. As with amendment No. 27, it is a serious thing to do, to say to a part of a public sector body that it is completely free of freedom of information. It seemed to me that because it is a serious matter, a Dáil vote would provide an extra safety guard against a future Minister making decisions. My understanding of the legislation is that such decisions are not just instigated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, for example, could go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and ask that a certain part of CIE would be exempt. We spoke earlier about school transport. A future Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform could agree to the request. We could begin to see, through decisions that do not have any Dáil oversight, the gradual erosion of freedom of information as an increasing number of bodies are potentially put outside it. A reasonable safety valve to introduce would be to ratify such decisions by Dáil vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">Again, the Deputy's intention is captured by the amendment I propose. He should examine amendments Nos. 33 and 34. The procedure for the Minister to be able to act in this way is important because as Deputy Donnelly said, nothing is set in stone. The Deputy wants Dáil oversight of decisions. My amendments Nos. 33 and 34 to the relevant sections, 6 and 7, require a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they come into effect. Any such decision must be laid formally before this House and the other House and it will require a formal acquiescence of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">It is a very simple amendment and I hope the Minister will not have a problem with it. It relates to the section where we are getting into the meat of what the Act is about, having gone through the various definitions. This is the first section dealing with a request for access to records under the Act. Section 12 states that a person who wishes to exercise their right of access shall make a request in writing or in other such form. I want to insert the word "or electronically" after the word "writing" because other such forms could include over the telephone but it is not specific that it includes an electronic request. I ask that the facility would be clear in the legislation. Given the times we are in, we should make specific provision for electronic communications.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_704">In page 27, to delete lines 33 and 34.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">This is the most substantial body of amendments as the section relating to fees caused serious debate. I withdrew my amendments on FOI fees on Committee Stage and said I would give the matter deep consideration because a coherent and strong case was made. I emphasised that I had listened closely to the views expressed by members of the committee on the amendments they tabled and that I would reflect carefully in advance of Report Stage on how best to address the issue of FOI fees and other matters. In that context, I asked my officials to undertake a detailed assessment of the case for reform of the FOI fees regime and a paper has been produced on the subject that I have made available to the various party spokespersons. I hope the paper was of use. The assessment was approached in the context of the Government's commitment to securing substantially greater openness, transparency and accountability in public administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> On the basis of this assessment, I have decided that a complete reform of the FOI fees regime is required reflecting elements of good practice in other vanguard FOI jurisdictions such as Australia and the UK. The Government has approved this reform and it will see changes including the removal of the application fee, the setting of caps on search, retrieval and copying fees, the provision of some search, retrieval and copying time free of charge and the proposed provision of information in simple administrative form outside of FOI. This will be achieved through the more proactive publication of information and open data policies as well as other access regimes, such as access to environmental information and the EU re-use of public sector information directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> In summary, the amendments relating to fees that I am proposing to the FOI Bill will make a significant difference. The amendments will see the abolition of the €15 application fee. I have heard it said in recent days that my goal is to reduce the fee to zero so that another Minister could later increase it but this is not the case. I have removed the power from the Bill to set an application fee so any re-introduction of the application fee will require primary legislation. I will introduce a cap of €500, which equates to approximately 25 hours' work, on the amount of search, retrieval and copying fees that can be charged and a further upper limit on estimated search, retrieval and copying fees at €700, or approximately 35 hours' work. Above this limit an FOI body could refuse to process a request, unless the requester is prepared to refine the request to bring the search, retrieval and copying fees below the limit. This is best practice in the UK and I met members of the UK authorities, including the Minister responsible, who believe it works very well. Rather than deal with a blunderbuss application that may take up to 50 hours to deal with, they ask the requester to break up the request into focused areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> A minimum threshold of €100, which equates to approximately five hours' work, below which no search, retrieval and copying fees will be charged will be introduced. In other words, there is no application fee and up to five hours of FOI search and retrieval work will be done for free. The provision relating to deposits will be retained. The Bill will introduce a definition to ensure that there is clarity on the activities for which search, retrieval and copying fees can be applied. This will be fully in line with the intention of the original legislation which includes all activities carried out leading up to the finalisation of a file containing the records for review by the decision maker prior to release. The amendments will also see the reduction of costs for internal reviews, as I set out, and a substantial reduction in the cost of appeals to the Information Commissioner has been agreed by the Government from the outset. In accordance with normal practice, the actual monetary amounts in each category will be set by way of ministerial order. The changes to the fees regime are dramatic and go a long way to take in the strong views expressed by Opposition Members and external groups. I listened carefully to the presentations made at the open Government forum and I spoke to a number of experts in FOI best practice around the globe to ensure Ireland can be an exemplar on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Some will argue this regime will put too much pressure on an over-burdened administrative system because we have reduced numbers but I feel it is appropriate and I am happy the Government has endorsed my proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">Like the other Deputies, I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and the fact that he reviewed a substantial part of the legislation that was debated on Committee Stage. The review was very useful and I thank the Minister and his officials. I can see that many of the arguments made by me and by other Opposition Deputies are reflected in these amendments and I welcome this fact. The removal of the upfront application fee is particularly welcome and the reductions are very good too. The table provided was very useful and shows that five to six hours are entirely free, which covers most FOI requests.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_712">I acknowledge that this is a huge and very welcome step forward but will make some observations in the spirit of improving the legislation further.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> The table on page 29 of the report shows there is a severe step change in the fees that can be charged. The first five or six hours are free but if a requester's application takes seven hours to process, he or she is to be charged for all seven hours. It is peculiar that the table indicates a charge of zero for each of the first few hours but then there is a sudden leap to €146 at the point of the seventh hour. Perhaps the ministerial order could allow that the first five hours are free and the hourly charge begins at the sixth hour with a charge for one hour. It makes more sense than suddenly charging for all seven hours as the step change is strange otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Similarly, when the table goes from 35 to 40 hours, the €500 cap ceases. My reading of the proposed amendment says the first five or six hours are free but if an application takes seven hours to process the charge is for all seven hours and the first five hours are no longer free. If this could be changed, that would be great. There is a linear relationship between fees charged and time taken after this point until fees flat-line at €500. However, if my understanding of the amendments is correct, when the 40-hour point is reached a body can refuse a request because it involves too much work.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">It can state that maybe it will still do it, but if it does there will be another step change. This does not seem the most helpful of profiles. If there is to be a charging regime I wonder whether it should be less punitive, particularly at the lower level, such as at seven hours where one moves from a zero charge to a €150 charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> When the Minister is putting together the ministerial order will he consider the charge per hour? I worked this out to be €20.95 or €21 an hour. I worked backwards to this being the equivalent of an annualised amount of €44,000. The report makes the point this is approximately half the cost of recovery and that the real cost incurred is approximately twice this. This suggests an annualised salary per hour worked of €88,000, which seems very high. After the five free hours, hour 6 should not cost one-six hours but one hour, and perhaps the €21 per hour is punitive. It feels very high. Will the Minister consider these points?</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> I also have an observation to make on a prevailing mindset and perhaps nothing needs to change. I thought the report was very useful but its prevailing mindset is that responding to freedom of information requests is not a primary role of the State in and of itself. This needs to change. The last sentence of paragraph 7.7 states, "This opportunity cost relates to the time that public servants spend in dealing with FOI requests rather than in carrying out their primary role and responsibilities in relation to the provision of public services". I would very much like to see this mindset changed and reflected in a less expensive and friendlier charging regime, which does not view responding to freedom of information requests as something which distracts public servants from their primary role but as part of their primary role. In a good healthy transparent government and public sector this should be seen as part and parcel of the primary role.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I again emphasise these issues are around the edges. The changes being made are excellent. My questions are whether the step-change can be examined, whether a charge of €21 an hour is punitive and whether anything can be done to change the mindset regarding providing the public with information being part of one of the many primary roles of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">This group of amendments substantially deals with fees. I accept some improvements have been made by the Minister since Committee Stage, and the improvements he intends to make when the draft statutory instrument is brought before the House for discussion should be helpful. I concur with Deputy Donnelly and I wish to highlight some issues which I ask the Minister to clarify when he responds.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> I found the legislation as originally drafted, on which we were working when we submitted our amendments after Committee Stage, unclear. Some time ago the Minister gave us a draft text he proposed to introduce and we have had an opportunity to propose amendments to it. I did so but they have been ruled out of order. At present, section 27 states, "Subject to this section, a fee of such amount as may be appropriate having regard to this section shall be charged". It made specific provision for a charge. The statutory instrument specifies a €15 charge and people felt this charge could be zero. I do not know who stated this, I could have said it myself. It sounds like something I would have said, that it seemed as though the charge was being reduced to zero but not necessarily being abolished. The amendment tabled by the Minister will mean the section will read, "Such amount as may be appropriate having regard to the provisions of this section shall be charged". The first line makes it look as though section 27 allows for fees which "shall be charged by the FOI body concerned under this subsection and paid by the requester concerned to the body in respect of the grant of an FOI request".</p>

          <p eId="para_728">What if they only read the first sentence? In most walks of life people read only the first sentence in most articles of most newspapers. Not everyone gets to read to the end. The section makes provision for a fee. We now come to the next sentence, which the Minister has pointed out and which I have underlined. It states, "The amount of a charge under this subsection shall be equal to the estimated cost of the search for and retrieval and copying of the record concerned by the FOI body concerned for the requester." This sentence states the only fee which can be charged is the search and retrieval fee. I take this to mean there cannot be an application fee.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">That is good and many people called for it. It would be churlish of people not to acknowledge the second sentence when they get to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> I tabled an amendment to the section before this, but related to this section, which was ruled out of order. I proposed there should be no application fee but it was ruled out of order because only the Minister can make such a provision. I also proposed a maximum amount of €500 and no fee for the first ten hours. The Minister has proposed five hours but I wanted to change this. It was ruled out of order because it was a potential charge on the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> The last subsection - it is subsection (14) - proposed in amendment No. 56 states, "An FOI body shall endeavour to establish a facility by which payment or refund of any fees due under this Act may be made electronically." I am happy with this. I tabled an amendment but was told it would be a cost to the Exchequer. I thought this was interesting and decided to put the point to the Minister in the Chamber rather than arguing with the Bills Office. It made the ruling and I will not argue. I hope that in the public service paying something electronically rather than manually would be a saving for the Exchequer and not a charge on the Exchequer. In conversation this morning with the Bills Office I stated that to my mind, and, I suspect, the mind of the Minister responsible, paying something electronically should be a more economical option, but I was told the system would have to be changed which could cost money. I stated the change to the system would save money.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">There is no point in arguing any further, but it is interesting. The Minister is responsible for public expenditure and he is introducing electronic payments and allowing people to deal by electronic means with a variety of State organisations. We want to encourage that system here from the Opposition side. This establishment, the Oireachtas, has taken the view that it is a charge on the Exchequer because there could be a cost in introducing a more efficient way of doing something compared with not trying to introduce a new system. I found it extraordinary that my amendment was ruled out on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> As we are on Report Stage we do not have a great opportunity to speak and can only make a short second contribution. We can argue about the search and retrieval fees. I published a Private Members' Bill on this topic 18 months or two years ago. I specified a cap of €500 after carrying out a full trawl of all Departments. I am sure the Minister has seen that - responses to a series of questions confirmed much the same thing. It is amazing what comes out of the woodwork and people with an interest started e-mailing me stating that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine had set a maximum fee but they were charged more. We will not argue about the exact accuracy, but the general picture was fairly clear across Departments. That is why I wanted a cap on the search and retrieval fees, as the Minister has done here, which I welcome. The Minister has addressed most of the issues we highlighted. Later in the debate we will come to a few of them relating to partially included bodies etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I want to take the Minister through subsection (4) which troubles me a bit. I thought personal information was sacred under the Freedom of Information Act. Personal information is supposed to be free and there was never even an application fee for personal information. The new subsection (4) states: "Where the record or records concerned contains or contain only personal information relating to the requester concerned the charge under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall not be made, unless the grant concerned relates to a significant number of records". We are now putting such a provision into legislation, perhaps for the first time. It goes against the spirit of what the Minister wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> On Committee Stage I gave the example of medical records. This amendment now provides that if a body has a significant number of personal records relating to the requestor, the requestor may be charged. I thought the principle was that personal information was to be free - not just free from the application fee, but free to get the information. This now facilitates the charging of a fee where the grant "relates to a significant number of records, and in considering whether or not such a charge shall be made, [there is an option not to charge it but it does not mean that public servants across the board will not] the means of the requester shall be taken into account." I believe I raised this issue on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> How is the FOI officer in Carrick-on-Shannon in the Department of Social Protection meant to know the means of everybody in the country? Is the decision maker meant to carry out a means test? This subsection has opened up an issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">The Minister is changing it. He is saying it was butchered in the past, but he is coming back to un-butcher it now. I just do not understand why he did not take this out. This provision jars in the case of a person seeking his or her own medical records. Many people have many medical issues and there can be substantial records. They could be on CD or other format. There was a time when patients went from the X-ray department carrying a big brown envelope, but now they get a disk to bring to the consultant in the room up the road, depending on the hospital, whether it is public or private as the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> That is bad enough. While I accept there is provision for it not to be charged, it states that the person making the decision may take the means of the requestor into account. I accept it should be relatively easy to establish the means of a person in receipt of a social welfare payment because the deciding officer is entitled to conclude that if the requestor is in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection his or her means have already been assessed and the Government is generally happy with that. However, for many people it is unfair that they should be charged for personal information. The Minister has done quite a good job in making amendments to the legislation, including abolishing the application fee. However, there was never an application fee for personal information. The Minister is now abolishing the application fee for non-personal information, but is still providing that a person seeking personal information may be charged certain retrieval fees, which jars with-----</p>

          <p eId="para_746">I know, but we are here changing the legislation. We are here to make the changes and not to copperfasten what was done in 1997. There have been many changes in this legislation. Before we come to decide on this amendment perhaps the Minister can take advice as to whether that subsection could be deleted. I do not know if he can do that. He cannot walk cleanly from this House today and say he has abolished fees for personal information. He is actually copperfastening fees for search and retrieval of personal information, which should not have been there to start with because the application was always free. So we are abolishing the application fee for non-personal information but we are copperfastening a fee for personal information search and retrieval if there are a significant number of records. I accept there is a method there for the deciding officer to assess the means of the requestor, which is arbitrary and unfair, and should not be there. Introducing a means test for this is not the way to go about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I ask the Minister to drop that subsection, which jars with what we are doing here. The section runs to two and a half pages compared with the previous section. On the previous day we discussed a measure covering the case where different sections in a Department had to deal with a request. Where was that? Has it been dropped or is it elsewhere in the Bill?

          <p eId="para_754"> On Committee Stage I highlighted the case of a person who wanted to get their full personal file from the Department of Social Protection relating to a disability invalidity payment. The person was told their request had to go to two different sections - to the means-testing section and to the medical section in the Department - and that was construed internally as two different requests. I did not think it should be, but that is how some people do it. It is all the more reason for having an exact code of practice. We are back to that again and we are happy to bring that in here.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> Those are some general observations. I am pleased with the search and retrieval fees. We could argue about the number of hours here or there, but I agree with the gist of the Minister's approach. When the Minister comes back with the draft statutory instrument, I presume some of that could even be teased out at that stage. It is good that the Minister has specified in subsection (1) that the only charge will relate to the cost of the search for, and retrieval and copying of the record concerned. However, subsection (4) is of concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_756">I acknowledge the significant changes that have been made in this section by amendment No. 56. Obviously that was the area over which people were most exercised and concerned. In order to change behaviour there must be a way to change behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The Minister referred to the concerns that might arise regarding the additional administrative burden but that can be reduced by people taking a different approach, namely, the open data approach the Minister is trying to drive. I believe it will be helpful in effecting that cultural change and not only is the fee reduction positive but the cultural change it will drive will also be positive. While acknowledging the point made by Deputy Donnelly on the tapering between five hours and seven hours and more, it is positive that the first five hours will be free. Overall, I wish to acknowledge all these significant changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> However, there was one point on which I wish to ask a question, which is that the new wording allows for different public bodies to set different overall ceilings. It is absolutely critical to have clarity and understanding, that some level of control will be applied in this regard and that it will be quite transparent. The Minister might revert to Members on how this will be calculated and as to what kind of control or culture will be involved in this particular aspect, because it obviously could become a significant problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I will also be brief and will cut to the chase as Members discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage. I am opposed to the charging of any fees in respect of freedom of information, FOI, requests. On Committee Stage, it was established that the charging of fees is not about cost recovery and the report the Minister compiled, which I acknowledge, makes that point again. The Minister is not charging to cover the costs as that would not be possible and nor - I imagine - would it be desirable in the Minister's mind. The question then arises as to why charge and what is the effect of charging. Members are aware that when charges and fees are levied at whatever point, it acts as a disincentive for people to make freedom of information requests. I acknowledge that from the Minister's perspective, he has changed radically the method by which he proposes to charge but, none the less, the regime he describes contains charges. This is entirely the wrong direction to take and the correct position is not to charge either an upfront fee or a search or retrieval fee. I revert to an earlier part of today's debate when the Minister referred to open data and to a system whereby datasets and a culture in which data are freely and routinely made available. I agree it is necessary to get to that point and when that point is reached, it will render the freedom of information legislation, if not redundant, then certainly not the key piece of legislative architecture in this regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> There is a reluctance within the system to share or make available information and the objective of everything Members must do is to ease the passage of information release. I have a principled opposition to the charging of fees, of which the Minister is aware as we debated this point long and hard on Committee Stage. The Minister has come a substantial way, in his own terms, by abolishing the €15 fee and so on. I ask him to go a little bit further and instead of inserting a lengthy amendment, to simply dispense with the notion of fees entirely. While I could go on, the Minister will be relieved that I will not do so this time. I could go through the details of my concerns on the amendment as drafted but the bottom line is that I do not believe in charging fees for freedom of information requests either upfront or through search and retrieval fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">I thank the Deputies for their comments, with which I will deal <i>seriatim</i>. I thank Deputy Donnelly for welcoming, in the main, the amendments I have tabled. He referred to the step change and it is by design, as having discussed this matter with the United Kingdom in particular, the idea is to make it much more user-friendly for freedom of information. To be blunt, I do not want people to make really complicated and burdensome FOI requests that will take between 40 and 70 hours of work. It would be much better if they made focused requests taking five hours on specific sets they seek. The entire idea is to encourage this and that is why the step change or tapering to which the Deputy has referred is included. I believe it is the right approach to take and that certainly is the information and advice I have had internationally. On the actual costs, the hourly cost, at €21, has not changed since 1997. The sum of €20.95 is the equivalent of what it cost in pounds in 1997. For Members' information, the equivalent charge in the United Kingdom at present is £25 sterling per hour. Consequently, I believe this is reasonable and I have not sought to increase the cost from 1997 levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_768">-----replicated. I cannot remember what the point was but I will come back to it. The Deputy made two further points, one of which pertained to the proposed section 27(4), which concerns personal information. That provision is mirroring the 1997 Act and it is a matter of reasonableness. All personal information will be free, by and large. This has been the position since 1997 but there must be some barrier in respect of reasonableness. For example, were one to request every item of information the public service possesses about oneself, there could be tens of thousands of items of information. Is it reasonable to make such a request and to get every Department and agency of the State beavering away on that? There must be an element of reasonableness in this regard. I am advised - my Department trawled through this - that this provision is seldom used. It is just for when someone makes an extraordinary request. I have seen requests from people in respect of genealogical pursuits, for example, where they basically wanted agencies of the State to draw up a family tree for them by going through every record in their family line going back 500 years. I am advised I should retain this provision simply to have some semblance of reasonableness with regard to personal information. However, by and large, it would be a rare exception to have any charge at all for personal information. Moreover, where it is charged, it will only be an actual cost of duplicating and finding that information. As for the electronic payment question, that certainly is what I intend to do and it will be part of the code of conduct. It will not be a requirement but will be where people wish to do it electronically and this obviously is what the Government is migrating towards. I still cannot remember what was the point I was trying to make with regard to the 1997 Act in response to the Deputy's first point, although it might come back to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned cultural change and I agree with her entirely. It is part of a suite of measures in which the Government seeks change. I have stated all along that having a common code of practice, having a requirement for trained FOI officers and having a consistency regarding FOI across the public service is almost as important as the content of the legislation because then, everybody will know what is expected of him or her. Moreover, there will be a common scrutiny of freedom of information, with a central FOI unit within my Department being responsible for that oversight. This will be very important and I agree with the Deputy that the aim is to have a mindset of openness. This goes to the point made ultimately by Deputy McDonald on moving towards open data and why I would have anything here. One must get to that point and must have systems. I already have been talking to the chief information officers about common systems to publish datasets, in order that information is made available more freely. Deputy Murphy also mentioned the different level of ceilings.</p>

It is odd that in the case of a person whose request involves seven hours' work one would provide five hours of work free of charge and impose a fee of €40 for the remaining two hours. Would the requester not be asked to split the request to ensure the work involved in each part did not exceed five hours? The Minister indicated that discussions took place with the United Kingdom on this issue. While I do not agree with charging any fees, if they are to apply, the sixth hour should be €20 and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> On the charge of €21 per hour, as per the report on the issue, the purpose of the fees regime is to strike a balance between providing reasonable access to public information and avoiding vexatious or lazy requests. I refer, for example, to a request for information that involves a civil servant clocking up 40 hours of work when the information was already available in the public domain. A request requiring 20 hours' work would incur a charge of €420. For many citizens, this does not strike a balance but indicates to them that they are not wealthy enough to submit their request. The counter-argument is that a person with such a request should break it up into four parcels of five hours' work as it would then be free of charge. Will the Minister confirm that a citizen who broke down a 20 hour request into four equal parcels would not incur a fee? If that were the case, it would go some way towards addressing the issue. Is it the Minister's view that a 20 hour request nominally costing €420 would be free if it were split into four bundles of five hours' work?</p>

          <p eId="para_775">The Minister did not respond to my question, although I know in any event what would be his response. I draw his attention to section 15, which allows a head to refuse to grant a freedom of information request on administrative grounds. Among other factors, an administrative refusal may be made where "in the opinion of the head, granting the request would, by reason of the number or nature of the records concerned or the nature of the information concerned, require the retrieval and examination of such number of records or an examination of such kind of the records concerned as to cause a substantial and unreasonable interference with or disruption of work (including disruption of work in a particular functional area) of the FOI body concerned". The system has an in-built check for dealing with voluminous requests, as they were described by the Minister. I will not labour the point as I have made my position clear on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I wanted to finish my reply to Deputy Catherine Murphy but she has left the Chamber. She made a point about different ceilings. Deputies will be aware that it is my intention to extend the scope of the freedom of information regime to a much wider group of organisations, including bodies that receive significant sums from the Exchequer, some of which will be charities. It may be necessary to have a lower threshold for such charities. I need to discuss with representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Cheshire Foundation, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland and other organisations what would be an appropriate regime because these bodies will be concerned about freedom of information legislation applying to them. I wish to be able to give them reassurance and to bring them along the path to freedom of information. I have covered most of the other points.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">While one can be theoretical about this issue, in practice there should be open dialogue between the requester and requested body. The latter should, if necessary, inform a requester that his or her request involves a great deal of work and ask precisely what information is sought. Good organisations do this already. The requester can then detail what is the net information he or she seeks to ensure it is provided for free. The reason for providing a free moiety, after which a fee will apply, is to incentivise both parties to take this approach.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">In page 30, to delete lines 2 to 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">While I am prepared to speak to both of them, amendments Nos. 49 and 53 are completely different. I am concerned that section 15 provides an opt-out to heads who may not wish to comply with the spirit of the legislation. Section 15(1)(<i>c</i>) basically allows a head to refuse a request on the basis that it involves too much work. Perhaps the Minister will publish guidelines on what would be considered an unreasonable request. I understand other Deputies raised this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Amendment No. 53 is unrelated to that issue. It provides that where a head refuses a request on the basis that the information sought is already in the public domain, he or she must direct the requester to the location of the relevant information. This is a simple requirement, which could be met by providing a hyperlink. As such, it places a simple and non-onerous burden of proof on any head who refuses a request because the information sought is already in the public domain. </p>

          <p eId="para_787">Amendments Nos. 49 and 51 seek to delete or amend the right of a public body to refuse a freedom of information request on certain administrative grounds. Amendment No. 49, which has been tabled by Deputy Donnelly, proposes to delete the provision which allows a body to refuse a request where the processing of the request would be likely to cause a substantial and unreasonable interference or disruption of work. I understand the logic of the Deputy's argument as it is reasonable to regard the processing of a request as a person's work, rather than a disruption of his or her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> In view of my decision to remove up-front fees and return to the architecture of the original Act of 1997, it is necessary to provide a guard against unreasonableness. Nevertheless, I accept the Deputy's point, which can be captured in the code of conduct. We have published a draft code, which I am sure Deputies have had an opportunity to read. </p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I am also sympathetic to the intention behind Deputy McDonald's proposal to allow for the publication of records relating to a request that was refused on the grounds that it would cause a substantial and unreasonable interference in the work of the body in question. </p>
          <p eId="para_790">However, I consider that the provision currently in the Bill is designed to deal with that particular type of request. The provision envisaged in the amendment would cause a substantial volume of work that would suck in personnel and pull them away from other important work, not only at the time of the request but at any time. Whether it is now or in three months' time it makes no difference. If it is a fact now, it will also be a fact in three months' time. On that basis I do not accept the proposal that it should be published in six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">The Minister is right - all of our views on this matter have been thoroughly aired.

          <p eId="para_794">I appreciate all of that. I do not think it is wise to have this in the legislation. I already cited section 15 which addresses the issue of administrative burden. It is dangerous, however, to make calls like that. I will give a real-life example of it. A number of survivors of the Bethany Home, and one in particular, made numerous FOI requests. I am told they were dismissed by the Department of Justice and Equality because they were considered to be a nuisance and constant callers. There is no doubt that these people were persistent in their pursuit of information, but time has proven just how correct they were to be persistent and to use pester-power in respect of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> I am unhappy with the language in the section, such as "frivolous", "vexatious" and "manifestly unreasonable", but according to whom? I am also unhappy with allowing somebody that scope for decision. I know there is a capacity to appeal but in section 15 the Minister has already built in a sufficient check or test in respect of any FOI requests that may come forward. I have said all of this to the Minister before, so there he has it.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">That is what I have just said. As regards Deputy McDonald's point, the original 1997 Act used the term "frivolous or vexatious", which is often used in legislation. I have come across cases, although rare, when somebody takes a down on a public official and says, "I am going to put in FOI requests every day about everything that you do". I have seen it happen. There has to be some blockage because, short of saying that such an approach is intimidation or besetting, it is not an appropriate use of FOI. We therefore need to have some safeguarding system within the code, especially when there is no cost involved in the regime I am proposing.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">We spent some time talking about this on Committee Stage. I was referring to specific queries, language, sequels and various other things. I have now re-examined the matter. Section 4 concerns when an FOI request is for information contained electronically across numerous devices. My concern is that this potentially provides some sort of opt-out or lack of keeping up with technological advancements. In lay person's language this concerns someone seeking a piece of information that may be on eight different PCs. Under this section, one is obliged to use whatever search and retrieval tools were available at the time. At that time, it may be that one had to log into each PC, which might be in eight different locations around the country. Someone might say that too much work is involved or else they will charge for the request because it would entail a lot of work. Since then, they may have been able to access all eight PCs from a centralised location. Under this subsection, however, it says they need only seek the information using whatever search tools existed at the time the information was created. I am concerned that, albeit unintentionally, it is locking in outdated technological search tools.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> If I am wrong, what problem is this subsection trying to solve? Can the Minister provide an example? I am unclear as to why electronic data are being treated differently in this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">It is on the basis of practicality. I consider the deletion of the section I inserted on Committee Stage as being a retrograde step. We had this discussion on Committee Stage. I accepted that the wording of section 17(4), published originally in the Bill in July 2013, gave an erroneous impression that access to FOI records concerning electronic recording was being somewhat restricted. Far from causing a restriction, that is not my intention. The Bill contains a number of provisions to take account of technological advances. To clarify, that includes electronic records and encompasses all databases. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> In response to the confusion and the debate we had caused by the original wording of subsection 17(4), I published the alternative wording for that section on Committee Stage. It was designed to explain the matter with more clarity. That wording was accepted and is now part of the Bill. Section 17(4) requires bodies to take reasonable steps to search for and extract data whether or not that would result in the creation of a new record. Previously, there was confusion as to whether the extraction of data from electronic sources, brought together in one record, would create a new record and would not therefore be permitted under the Act. The purpose of section 17(4) is to remove that uncertainty. It is a positive development to ensure greater access to a variety of data - held extraneously or differently on a variety of databases - which can be amalgamated into a single new data file and be covered under the Act. That is a great advance and I hope it meets the concerns expressed by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">The purpose of this amendment is to correct a drafting issue. Section 20 of the 1997 Act provided that a head may refuse to grant a freedom of information request if the record concerned contains matter relating to "the deliberative processes of the public body concerned". That text was amended in the 2003 Act to refer to "the deliberative processes of a public body". The effect of the 2003 amendment is that, for example, if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform received a freedom of information request for records relating to a deliberative process in the Department of Health, those records would be afforded the same protection as if the request had been made to the Department of Health. This is considered to be the correct approach on advice from Parliamentary Counsel.</p>

          <p eId="para_994">I move amendment No. 72:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_995">In page 57, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_996">"(10) Subject to <i>subsections (1) </i>to <i>(9)</i>, where the information relates to personal information of the requester, such information shall be released even where the information is provided by a third party.".</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I mentioned a particular case on Committee Stage but I will not labour the point too much. With the Department of Social Protection, for example, a person may not be approved for a disability allowance or invalidity payment and before a proper review or appeal is requested, one must see what is on file and establish the reasons the request was not granted in the first place. I would encourage such people to make a freedom of information request to establish the reason their request was declined, as it may relate to means or medical grounds, for example. The Department of Social Protection is the best Department for responding to freedom of information requests, but perhaps other cases will ultimately be covered by codes of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> I have encountered cases where a person may not have the form signed by their GP returned. It may stipulate whether requirements were mild, moderate, profound or severe. The reason for the form not being returned could be that the form was signed by a doctor, which is a third party even when it is the GP of the person concerned. The consent of the person who completed the form is required because he or she is an interested or relevant party. This can lead to cases where a person's medical assessment cannot be released unless the GP formally consents to the release of such information. This seems a bit severe and perhaps somebody is interpreting regulations quite literally. Perhaps a representative of doctors has indicated to the Department somewhere along the line that before any medical assessments are released, that group should be informed. We regularly get letters from public bodies informing us of a freedom of information request. There has been confusion on a couple of occasions and perhaps these were isolated. Conversely, it may be established practice. If a person requests their own information, it should be released, even if a third party has not given consent.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_999">The potential for release of personal information under freedom of information is one of the most sensitive aspects of the regime. The provisions included in the current Act were carefully crafted to provide a very high but not absolute level of protection for personal information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Notwithstanding the many complex and difficult issues that have arisen in the area of personal information over the years, and the application of the freedom of information Acts, the existing provisions have, I believe, stood the test of time. Notwithstanding this, it will be very important that the code of practice for freedom of information provides further guidance on several aspects of the treatment of personal information under the legislation. Deputy Fleming has adverted to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> A key presumption in freedom of information is that a person should have access to his or her own personal information. This is reflected, for example, in the absence of any fees or charges for personal freedom of information requests. That was always so before this new provision. This is not, however, an absolute right and must be balanced against other objectives such as, for example, ensuring public bodies receive confidential information on matters which are relevant to the performance of their duties and responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> There are a wide range of circumstances in which a public body may hold what would fall within the definition of personal information under freedom of information legislation in circumstances that the relevant information has been provided by a third party. These records could relate, for example, to the medical or psychiatric history of a person; social work cases, where there might be distressing facts that need further criminal investigation; performance assessments or employment references; or Garda security or intelligence matters. It cannot be the case that a person would have an unrestricted right to such information in all circumstances, which would override all other considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> The legislation explicitly provides that a decision-maker must take into account the possible harm to the requester from the release of particular health records, allowing these to be released to a nominated health professional. More generally, in deciding on a request for information, the decision-maker must take cognisance of the basis that exists for exercising relevant exemptions that may apply to third-party information on a person held by a public body. In some cases an absolute prohibition may exist on the release of that information. In others, a public interest balancing test may apply. It is very unlikely that there would be one approach that aligned with every set of circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> It cannot, however, be correct that all such information would always be released. It could do terrible damage to people to release some information in that way. Such an approach would be likely to have what could be described as a chilling effect on the appropriate communication of information from one public body to another. It is important that many bodies receive information in confidence from third parties which may assist them in providing services to vulnerable members of the community and that they would be able to do that on the basis that there would not be an absolute right to release that information to a requester. I do not believe we should move from the tried and trusted path that has existed since the 1997 Act in respect of this very sensitive area. I hope the Deputy appreciates that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">I thank the Minister for his considered response. He has clarified the point because there probably is a general presumption that a person has an automatic right to all personal information on him or herself. The Minister has reminded me of cases of people who were, to use the old phrase, committed against their will and there was probably information on the files that could do them further harm if they were to see it now about who committed them or who made a request, which could cause mayhem in certain situations. I can understand and I am grateful that the Minister reminded me of the fact that the right to one’s personal information is not absolute because it could have serious consequences. I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister when drafting the code of practice will try to tease this point out in more detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_1006">I move amendment No. 73:</p>

          <p eId="para_1008">This relates to different situations where a head may refuse information if it deals with the financial and economic interests of the State. I understand the section in general and the refusal of information if it affects the State’s ability to collect tax or levy rates or if it affects foreign investment or industrial development. The particular lines I want deleted are:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1009">(r) advising on or managing public infrastructure projects, including public private partnership arrangements (within the meaning of the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002).</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The arrangements under the existing Act without that section prevent information coming out about public private partnerships, PPPs, because of their commercial sensitivity. I believe there are enough provisions in the legislation to protect any of the issues relating to public private partnerships and the management of these infrastructural projects already in the system without this. Some of the information that would not be commercially sensitive could be released. I am worried that this blanket permission for a head to refuse information is too extensive and wide ranging. A more specific version of the present arrangement would be better.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">Section 40(1), which is also contained in the 1997 Act, provides that access to a record may be withheld if its release could have a serious adverse effect on the ability of the Government to manage the national economy or financial interests of the State, could result in undue disturbance of the ordinary course of business, could reasonably be expected to have a negative impact on decisions by enterprises to invest or expand in the State or could reasonably be expected to result in an unwarranted benefit or loss to a person or class of persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> Section 40(2) lists a range of records to which subsection (1) applies. In addition to the classes of records which could be protected under the 1997 Act, this Bill adds some classes of records in light of freedom of information being extended to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, group of companies, including those the Deputy’s amendment seeks to delete, such as records relating to liabilities of the State or a public body and records advising on, or managing, infrastructure projects, including PPP projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> I reassure Deputy Fleming that the section does not restrict access to such records automatically but only in the circumstances where the grounds in section 40(1) apply, in other words, where the deciding officer would on balance believe the specific information would have the deleterious effect we have set out. That section has been in operation since the 1997 Act and is an important safeguard for the State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1020">It is some time since that was done. One is long overdue. As a first step the committee some time ago asked the Information Commissioner to examine all the items in Schedule 3, which deals with enactments excluded from the application of section 41, which deals with the enactments relating to non-disclosure of records. The Information Commissioner presented a detailed and comprehensive report to the committee last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The report related to the enactments that are excluded from the scope of the freedom of information regime, as restated in Schedule 3 to this Bill. The excluded statutes are set out on page 79 of the Bill and the excluded statutory instruments are set out on page 81. The Information Commissioner recommended that 52 enactments - my recollection is that approximately 100 pieces of primary legislation and statutory instruments are on the list - should be removed from Schedule 3. In approximately 48 cases, she agreed with the reasoning for their retention on the list. The Department gave its commentary to the Office of the Information Commissioner, which passed it on to us. My amendment, which follows on from the report the committee received from that office some time ago, proposes that "the 52 non-disclosure provisions recommended for exclusion in <i>Schedule 3</i>, where the Information Commissioner disagreed with the views of the relevant Departments, shall be deleted from <i>Schedule 3</i>". I am calling for the deletion of those 52 provisions from Schedule 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> The Information Commissioner, who was very responsible in her work, agreed that approximately half of the enactments should be left on the list. I do not have Ms O'Reilly's detailed report with me, but my recollection is that her report referred to certain enactments - page 80 of this Bill refers to "No. 42 of 2004 - Health Act 2004 - Section 26", to "No. 22 of 2005 - Veterinary Practice Act 2005 - Section 25" and to "No. 10 of 2005 - Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 - Section 73" - that set out the recruitment and grievance procedures etc. applying to doctors, nurses and other professions. Those areas should not be shrouded in a cloak of secrecy for good reasons. The Department did not see fit to legislate in that way, however. Ms O'Reilly disagreed with that. I agree with her assessment, on balance, because I believe there is still a culture of trying to hide information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> I will refer to an example I have encountered recently of the way things work in the public service. I do not know whether it relates directly to the problem I am trying to address. I was shocked by this case, which I am taking up with the line Minister. A person whose reputation was damaged as a result of a public servant carrying out his duties in an unsatisfactory manner took the public body in question - the HSE - to court. It went to the High Court. I will not give the Minister all the details. It is on the public record. I am not providing any confidential information. I have read the High Court's 101-page decision. The High Court judge rightly condemned the performance of the public official. An award of approximately €763,000 was made against the Irish taxpayer because of the way public officials went about their business in following up the allegations that damaged this person's good name, character and career prospects. When this matter went back into the public sector after the High Court had dealt with it, a debriefing of the High Court decision took place within the public service and it was decided that no disciplinary action should be taken against the individual public servant concerned. Maybe he was doing his best, but got it wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> As a result of the decision not to take disciplinary action - some of the enactments I have mentioned contain provisions relating to disciplinary action - no record of the public servant's involvement in this case, which cost the State over €750,000 and on foot of which serious statements were made by a judge, was kept on his personal file. I got a phone call last week to inform me that the public servant in question has been approved for promotion by the relevant public body. When I took it up with the chief executive of the State body concerned, I was told that neither he nor the interview board was aware of this. It was not on the person's file because no disciplinary action had been taken. As a consequence, the interview board had no knowledge of the matter. He was offered the job on the basis of his CV and his performance at an interview. No record of what had happened was considered. I am not saying it should have prevented him from getting the job, but those involved should have been made aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> This case gives us an example of the kinds of disciplinary issues that are covered by the enactments listed in Schedule 3. I am thinking specifically of the Health Acts, but other Acts relating to dentists and other medical bodies are also covered by this legislation. These bodies do not want light to shine on what goes on under these Acts. Over the years, the Department has succeeded in getting them included in Schedule 3 so that they are excluded from these freedom of information provisions. I am talking about public bodies governed by statute that are covered by the freedom of information regime, but benefit from having particular sections of particular Acts excluded from freedom of information. Emily O'Reilly has expressed her disagreement in 52 such cases. I suggest that her considered view on this matter is probably a more balanced view as it is in the interests of the public rather than the line Department. I ask the Minister to make arrangements to agree with my amendment, which follows on directly from the recommendation of the Information Commissioner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1026">I will not comment on the specific case highlighted by the Deputy because I have no detail on it. I have no knowledge - good, bad or indifferent - of the case the Deputy instances. I will confine my response to the specific legislative provision and the amendment. Section 41, as contained in section 32 of the original 1997 Act, upholds the operation of specific confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions in other enactments - this is the very thing Deputy Fleming has been talking about - unless such provisions are listed in Schedule 3 to this Bill, in which case they are subordinate to freedom of information. Provision is made in the legislation for the review of secrecy provisions in other enactments. As the Deputy rightly identified, the members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform can review and make recommendations from time to time on the question of whether these provisions should be amended or repealed. If it is recommended that they should continue in force, the joint committee has the power to recommend whether they should override freedom of information or should be included in Schedule 3. That is a power of the Oireachtas at committee level. I have been informed that such a review is currently under way. It will be a matter for the committee, of which Deputy Fleming is a member, to recommend which of the non-disclosure provisions should be included in Schedule 3. That will be the committee's job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> The Act does not provide for a ministerial power to amend Schedule 3 to remove or include specific provisions. It is not a matter for me. I sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the matter with a view to providing for a ministerial power to make an order which would allow Schedule 3 to be amended if a public body accepted the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee. I am advised by that Office of the Attorney General that as a matter of constitutional law, I cannot by order amend primary legislation in that way. It would be a matter for the Oireachtas as a whole. The advice of the Attorney General makes it clear that it is not legally feasible to make an amendment to an Act with the effect that decisions of the Information Commissioner should override primary legislation made by the Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President. As such, we must rely on the Oireachtas committee, of which the Deputy is a member, to decide what action should be taken, as provided for in section 41, and for amendments to Schedule 3 to be made by way of primary legislation if so recommended. On that basis, there is no basis for me to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">It is a great committee for one's prospects of getting a promotion. I suggest that if one joins the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform or perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts, one's chances of being promoted will be very high.

          <p eId="para_1032">We all know that too. Perhaps the Minister might use his good office to have a word with his party colleague who is the Chairman of the joint committee and see whether he can move on this topic. It is a very busy committee and it deals with many issues. The Chairman of the committee is involved in the banking inquiry. Something needs to be done in the meantime. Over the years, many people have asked who regulates the regulator. We are meant to regulate the regulator. This is one of the few legislative provisions in which an Oireachtas committee is given a specific function involving the review of legislation. The committee in question has failed to do so. I am just one of the committee's 27 members. As the Minister might have gathered, I am probably the only member of the committee who has been pushing this issue. I would appreciate the support of the other members of the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1041">Amendments Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive, and parts of Amendments Nos. 84 and 88, relate to an anomaly relating to how the records of the Information Commissioner are treated under FOI. FOI does not apply to records relating to reviews conducted by the Information Commissioner under the FOI Acts. Only the records relating to the general administration of the Office of the Information Commissioner are subject to FOI. There is no similar exemption in regard to reviews conducted by the Information Commissioner under the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007. The Information Commissioner sought that this anomaly be addressed. In fact, it was the previous Information Commissioner, Ms O'Reilly, who asked that this amendment be submitted. This is being effected by providing an exemption to the Office of the Information Commissioner in respect of the records it holds in regard to both types of review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1049">I should have also referred to amendments Nos. 84 and 93 because they are in this group. The purpose of those amendments is to provide for an exemption from FOI for the records of child abuse bodies other than in regard to their administrative records. The bodies in question are the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> In view of the sensitivity of the records held by these bodies and the fact that, even if their records were subject to FOI in full, it is likely they would be exempt from release under the FOI exemptions contained in this legislation relating to personal information and information obtained in confidence, I considered, having received a request, that these bodies be exempted from FOI. I decided, however, that it would be difficult to justify providing them with an exemption in respect of the administrative records that they hold. Legal advice received from the Attorney General raised no legal difficulties in making these bodies subject to FOI in terms of their administrative records. The exemption proposed for these bodies will be similar to that applying to the Office of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"><b>
						</b>Regarding the Central Credit Register, the purpose of amendment No. 84 is to provide an exemption for the Central Bank in respect of records relating to the Credit Register to be established under the Credit Reporting Act 2013. The Credit Reporting Act 2013, which provides for the establishment, maintenance and operation of a central credit register by the Central Bank, was enacted in 2013. When that register is established, it will contain records of virtually all borrowings and repayments of individuals across the State. The credit histories relating to individuals and persons who are licensed or regulated by the Central Bank will be covered under the existing Central Bank exemptions under FOI. Some companies not regulated by the Central Bank, for example, Dunnes Stores and Ryanair, would be subject to consideration for release under FOI as the Bill now stands, although there is a very strong likelihood that such records would be exempt because they were received in confidence or they are commercially sensitive. I am, however, proposing this exemption on the basis that confidential personal information relating to an individual’s financial affairs should not be included under the remit of FOI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The other issue relates to Iarnród Éireann. Before the Bill was published, it was decided that Irish Rail would be brought under the remit of FOI. In making arrangements for this measure, it became clear that the inclusion of Irish Rail would have to be refined to ensure that no unintended consequences would result. Does the Deputy remember I said that monopolies would be captured? Rosslare Europort is operated by Irish Rail in a commercial environment and should be treated in the same way as the other commercial ports, and that is what I intend to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">I thank the Minister. When I read the reference to Rosslare I thought it was something to do with Wexford but I was willing to let it pass. If there was something to do with Wexford I would not try to block it but if it in any way helps the operation down there, well and good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> Amendment No. 84 deals with the Office of the Commissioner for Environmental Information. I accept what the Minister said about the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and so on but in sub-paragraph (d) of the amendment, the Minister is inserting a provision which is essentially to restrict freedom of information in these situations. I have a problem with restricting environmental agencies in terms of not being able to get environmental information.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">Generally, I understand what is involved but there is one issue. I tabled amendments which are part of this group. Amendment No. 101 is in my name and the Minister's name and it deals with EirGrid. EirGrid is the issue I want to talk about in this group. We put the case to the Minister on Committee Stage that Irish Water is now under FOI and EirGrid is a State monopoly. The Minister is bringing EirGrid into the section in the legislation that deals with partially included agencies. There are exempt agencies and partially included agencies. Amendment No. 86 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1095">EirGrid plc, other than insofar as it relates to records held by it relating to its functions under its transmission system operator licence granted under section 14(1)(e) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999;[.]</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">I note the debate we had and that EirGrid will have commercial transactions with various power plants on such issues as what it is paying and when they come online. Those are commercial issues because there are many providers other the ESB and it is a commercial business. That is not what my party is getting at, but will the Minister confirm, because one gets lost with partially included bodies and what is included in the provision, that it means EirGrid other than in so far as it relates to its functions? Will he clarify that, once the Bill is enacted and fully implemented, all aspects of EirGrid's work on the planning process of the pylons, Grid Link, Grid West and the North-South interconnector will be subject to FOI? I can understand the Minister would have a difficulty in relation to the commercial sensitivity aspect of EirGrid's dealings with the power plants, but what has exercised the public mind more than anything is the performance of EirGrid's public duties in so far as it affects the planning of routes, planning applications and the public consultation process. He will be aware there were 35,000 submissions and as a Leinster Member, he will be aware of the areas affected and that there is quite a lot of controversy in many other areas. Will the Bill facilitate full FOI disclosure on the planning of these projects? This would not be the commercially sensitive aspect. It is only the early stages before anybody ever talks of construction or the cost of a pylon and I want to know if that will be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> If it is included, will the Minister indicate the earliest year about which a person can make an FOI request? There are EirGrid disputes that are probably going on a number of years. I intend it to go back not to the year dot or anything like that, but up to six years. He might also state the earliest date about which a person will be able to make an FOI request on EirGrid in the future. For example, there have been several oral hearings and An Bord Pleanála decisions on EirGrid in recent years. If those who felt they did not get all the information one gets at such hearings or the information that is published by the applicant, and EirGrid will only have published what suited its application in these hearings, will this provide an opportunity for them to be able to use FOI to get information on some of those projects that are currently trundling away through the system? The Minister might clarify precisely what type of information will be available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">It was a bit churlish of me not to state that, unusually, two of these amendments, amendments Nos. 101 and 104, are jointly sponsored by myself and Deputy Sean Fleming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> To deal with the specific points he made which relate to the energy network companies, Deputies will be aware of statements made by the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in recent weeks that he was in favour of FOI applying to the monopoly energy network businesses of the ESB, Ervia and EirGrid. Ervia is the new company that has taken over the business of Bord Gáis Éireann since Bord Gáis Energy, the competitive gas energy supply business, was sold earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> On foot of that commitment, my officials have been engaging with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in an effort to draft a suitable amendment to ensure that the monopoly businesses of the bodies are made subject to FOI but that the integrity of the supply of both gas and electricity is safeguarded in the strategic interests of the State. It will also be necessary to ensure that the commercial enterprises of the companies are protected, consistent with other commercial public bodies, and that a situation is not created where the financial standing of the companies and their ability to attract funding from the financial markets on the best possible terms for critical future investments is put at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> What I have decided to do is to make preliminary amendments at this stage. I may have to revisit these in the Seanad in the autumn to ensure that the issues I have already mentioned are adequately addressed. Ervia is a company in development and the current licence holder as transmission and distribution system operator is Gaslink Independent System Operator Limited. This is likely to change in the short term when Ervia establishes its gas network company as a subsidiary. Any changes to the Bill as a result of developments in this area will also be addressed before the Bill concludes its passage through the other House. I will pursue these issues in consultation with the new Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and with the Commissioner for Energy Regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> The specific amendments I am tabling here are to remove Bord Gáis Éireann from the list of exempt agencies and replace it with its successor Ervia and to provide an exemption in Schedule 1 Part 1 so that the impact of amendments Nos. 87 and 97 is that the records of Gaslink Independent System Operator Limited as transmission and distribution system operator under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002 are subject to FOI. The impact of amendments Nos. 86 and 101 is to remove EirGrid plc from the list of exempt agencies in Schedule 1 Part 2 and to add it to the list of agencies that are exempt in part in Schedule 1 Part 1 so that its records relating to its licensed functions as transmission system operator under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 are subject to FOI. As ESB Networks Limited is a separate legal entity from the ESB Group, I am leaving the ESB Group in the exempt list, but in amendment No. 86 I am including an exemption for ESB Networks Limited in Schedule 1 Part 1 so that the records of ESB Networks Limited relating to its licensed functions as distribution system operator under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 are subject to FOI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">This all sounds complicated but I am stripping the commercial bits from the monopoly bits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> The exemption for Irish Water is being deleted from the Bill in amendment No. 104 and I have already given my reason for the exemption of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.</p>

While we will not go the wire on this, I am still shocked how the agency and the Department of Finance got one over on the Minister on this. Here we are opening up freedom of information, abolishing fees and encouraging open government and open data, but the Minister’s friends in high places got at him to put in an amendment to ensure information concerning the remuneration, terms and conditions of those in the NTMA are not available to freedom of information, other than when that information is contained in the records in summary or collective form such as that individuals cannot be identified. A cloak of secrecy is being put around the pay of the top people in the NTMA. Shame on the Minister for falling for that. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, obviously told the Minister he can have his freedom of information but he keeps his secrecy for his NTMA. That is not a good development.</p>

There is commercially sensitive information in these organisations which should exempt them from freedom of information and there are sufficient safeguards in the legislation to achieve this. I am not in favour of an approach which gives them full protection, however. It is important and useful that there should be bits and pieces where these organisations are open to freedom of information to remind them they work for the citizens ultimately.

          <p eId="para_1138">We have discussed this matter of exemptions up and down. I too have significant reservations around blanket exemptions. The supposition should be inclusion, bar where it can be demonstrated there are reasons of commercial sensitivity - that old chestnut - or other reasons as set out in the legislation. Organisations should have to bring forward actively reasons under sections 32, 36, 37 or 39 as to why they should be exempted. The purpose of my amendment is to deny any agency that type of blanket exemption.</p>

          <p eId="para_1139">We have discussed this at length. Deputies Donnelly and McDonald are proposing the deletion of the entire list of exempt and part-exempt bodies. I do not propose to accept the Deputies’ amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> I do not believe one could have a commercial State sector operating to a completely different set of rules from its competitors. It would hamstring their capacity in achieving the best interests of the shareholder, namely, the citizen. They have to be allowed to operate on an equal footing with commercial companies which are not subject to freedom of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> I had long discussions with my friend and colleague, the Minister for Finance, on NAMA, the National Asset Management Agency. I accepted the case he made that the disclosure of full information relating to the remuneration of NTMA company staff would place the body at a serious commercial disadvantage in recruiting and retaining expertise. Many people are migrating out of these bodies. As the economy recovers, pay rates in the private sector are robust in comparison to pay rates in the NTMA and NAMA. I have had discussions about improving taxpayers’ knowledge of remuneration rates in the agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">The Deputy is aware that in the annual report and accounts the NTMA provides information on remuneration of top level staff on an anonymised basis on a €50,000 width band. It sets out how many are in X category, X category plus €50,000, Y category plus another €50,000 and so on. In keeping with the need to promote greater openness on pay I requested that the NTMA should take further steps to disclose additional information on remuneration levels. I suggested that those bands would be reduced to €25,000. In discussions, the NTMA has agreed to that, and to reduce the pay bands in its 2013 annual report to reflect that. I do not think I am in a position to accept the amendment in that regard.</p>

Sometimes the Houses of the Oireachtas are criticised on the slow passage of Bills but the Bill has been significantly improved by the work of the Members of the House, in particular on Committee Stage. I have given very careful consideration to all the very strong cases made. I responded in very careful terms to very good amendments tabled by the Deputies opposite, including looking at international best practice and providing reports and documentation to the Opposition in terms of what happens on the international stage in relation to such legislation. As a result, the FOI Bill that is about to pass is in very good order. It is an exemplar among FOI regimes. I know there are tweakings that others would have liked. It may well be that I will have to come back to the House depending on amendments that arise in the Seanad but it is my objective to have the regime in operation for next year. I thank sincerely the Deputies opposite for their involvement and hard work in advancing the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1195">Amendment No. 23 seeks to ensure any licence granted accords with the principles of sustainable forest management. We discussed at length the need to define clearly sustainable forest management and I contend that the Rio principles on this should guide and inform how we come to that definition, but the Government has rejected my contention. This is unfortunate but sustainable forest management is referred to in section 2 so it is a condition for the issuing of licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> We discussed the issue of Gougane Barra previously and I have spoken to people about this. It links to issues of public consultation and sustainable forest management. The Minister has defended the action as a preventative one to stop the spread of a disease but there was no real consultation with the public, concerned stakeholders, environmental groups, the community on which it will impact and so on. The so-called consultation process can be cursory and tokenistic but real active participation by all key stakeholders, including communities, environmental groups, heritage groups and those with an interest in our forests is necessary for big decisions such as cutting down much of a national park like Gougane Barra. It is necessary to hear all the arguments and consider all the evidence to ensure such big decisions are properly informed. This is what sustainable forest management is about, a real participation by everyone involved. However, this is not how things are done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> One could argue that Coillte is something of a secret society because it is not covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm that Coillte employees must sign a confidentiality clause that negates any commitment to public consultation. How can this square with real engagement with the community and stakeholders? It seems Coillte employees can say nothing publicly of Coillte's activities, and this is a real problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> The decision was made to abandon the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights and afterwards the merger with Bord na Móna was announced. This merger has potentially enormous implications for the future development of a forestry model in Ireland, and some of us are concerned that the merger may have been motivated by a narrow desire to exploit Coillte's land mass resource. Forestry, in the narrowest sense of the word, could mean the facilitation of large industrial wind farms with serious implications for forests. Huge controversies have arisen over such use of Coillte's lands. For example, there has been much controversy and conflict in north Mayo over the building of a refinery there on Coillte's lands. I am speaking of big decisions on the use of public land and forestry resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">We have to have the most stringent requirements for real engagement with the public and stakeholders when we make enormous decisions impacting on something as important as this forest and land resource. Stating that any licences granted by the Minister, to Coillte or anybody else, must be in line with sustainable forest management is a critical safeguard in the protection of our natural resources from inappropriate development, potentially environmentally-damaging development and development which could potentially damage our heritage and adversely affect other areas such as tourism, walking and mountaineering. Sustainable forest management is an holistic overall view of forestry rather than one too narrowly defined, where decisions are taken very secretively without proper consultation. This is the logic behind stating that all licences should be conditional on the notion of sustainable forest management.</p>

          <p eId="para_1200">I cannot accept amendments Nos. 22 and 23. With regard to amendment No. 22, the Minister must be empowered to attach conditions to a licence or grant approved by the Minister. Attaching such conditions may be required to address issues of public safety, to protect taxpayers funds, or for reasons related to environmental protection. The attachment of conditions to licences and grants is nothing new and the cost associated with such conditions is part of the normal cost of doing business. Furthermore, whether or not such costs are justified is highly subjective and not appropriate for inclusion in legislation. This is the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> With regard to amendment No. 23, one of the Minister's primary functions, as expressed in section 11, is to safeguard the environment and follow good forest practice. It is implicit in the Bill therefore that when the Minister attaches conditions to any approval or licence a basic requirement of such conditions will be the adherence to good forest practice, including compliance with the relevant guidelines and standards issued by the Minister. As I stated previously, sustainable forest management is not defined in the Bill because it is not a fixed concept. The internationally accepted definition of sustainable forest management will invariably evolve over time to reflect the changing values of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202"> The Bill is not about Coillte, as I have stated on several occasions in the past. I do not know how much Deputy Boyd Barrett deals with Coillte, but I deal with it on a regular basis and I have much interaction with it. The change of direction is a challenge for the organisation and I believe it can do it in a good way for the State. It will be important from the taxpayers' point of view as they will get value for the investment being made. Access to information is covered under the access to information regulations. Coillte has public consultation on all of its management plans and it is obliged to do so. As a Member of Parliament, the Deputy should see for himself and meet the people involved in Coillte and see how they do business. He would find it informative and I have no doubt, given his concern and interest in trees, that he would find it very worthwhile. I invite him to do so because Coillte has a very good project and model.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> The Deputy said he met various people. Over the weekend I met a forester in my home town. He is a man of many years' experience and stated what is good about what is happening in Coillte now is that it will do what it has always been good at, which is marketing trees and wood and cutting and growing wood. There is huge potential for work and projects throughout the organisation to the benefit of the taxpayer in the long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_1205">I thank the Minister of State. I should take up the offer to meet Coillte. I have had some engagement in recent times with some Coillte staff. I do not want to underestimate the value of much of the work done by many of the people who work for Coillte. What I say is not in any sense across-the-board criticism of Coillte. What is important is the mandate of Coillte, and the extent to which it, and anybody engaged in forestry, is subject to proper environmental guidelines and principles which inform forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> The Minister of State has described one aspect of forestry, as has his friend in forestry, which is forestry as a crop. This is an important aspect but it is only one aspect. What slightly worries me is that the legislation is geared primarily towards this and I fear Coillte is geared too much in this direction. I do not state it does not do other things as it does some other things very well but, let us be honest, there is a tension between the pressure to see the thing as a crop, perhaps on a short term basis, and sustainable long-term forestry with stewardship, development and expansion of the forest resource in every sense, economically, socially and environmentally. Serious questions are raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> I will be interested to hear the response of the Minister of State on why Coillte is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Is it true Coillte employees must sign a confidentiality clause? Who did Coillte consult on such a big decision to cut down huge amounts of the trees in Gougane Barra and close down a forest park? I heard there was a cursory consultation with the forest liaison group and that was it. I would like to hear more on this. We need to have broader more comprehensive principles informing the granting of licences when we deal with such an important resource.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">Coillte is subject to the same regulations as any other landowner and this is the reality. With regard to who it consulted in Gougane Barra, certainly it would have been great to consult many other people but there was a disease. I explained this to the Deputy on the previous occasion. The explanation I gave him then is the same. Obviously the decision was not taken lightly. One does not make a decision to fell trees in a place of such beauty as Gougane Barra lightly or without having reason to do so which will stand up. When the Forest Service made the decision it consulted widely on what it could do about the disease and what was the best way to deal with a problem it had. No more than a vet would take a decision on animals with disease, somebody must take a decision, and allowing a disease to go wild and delaying is not the way to do it. Professional specialists were asked and they gave the answer, and that is when it was done.</p>

I am trying to change this so that the grant can only be taken back if the person has failed to comply with the conditions of the grant. That is what normally happens with a grant.

          <p eId="para_1242">I move amendment No. 26:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1243">In page 10, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1244">“8. (1) The Minister should establish a working group based on the Forestry Liaison Group, with balanced representation for the social, environmental and economic stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1245">(2) The working group may create sub-groups to issue advice on specific areas when required in consultation with the Minister.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1246">(3) The working group should have input in setting of agendas and work.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1247">(4) The working group should act as a link between international and national forest policies.</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1248">(5) The terms of reference of the working group should be set by the stakeholders and be guided by the Rio Forest Principles.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">This moves from the general case that I have been putting for sustainable forest management and adequate public consultation to the specific, as it were. To ensure we have a sustainable approach to forest management and to ensure as part of a sustainable approach that we have a comprehensive, broad, balanced, democratic attitude and approach, the forest liaison group as it is currently constituted, which advises the Government on these matters, should be required to have a balance in terms of the social and environmental pillars, as it were, as well as maybe those connected more to the industry, farming and so on, which are also very important parts of all this. We could probably add in mountaineering groups and walking groups. We need a real balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong in this. As I understand it, there is one environmental representative on the forest liaison group and it is much more industry focused. My amendment would make it a requirement whereas what the Minister of State proposes provides that the Minister basically should have the discretion to decide what experts he or she might want on this committee. I do not think that is good enough. It should not be a matter of discretion whether we have sustainable forest management. It should not be the right of any future Minister to skew forest management, which is such an important resource, in a particular direction if it threatens the integrity of this important resource. That is the logic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> My amendment again refers to the Rio principles. The Minister of State has made the point that sustainable forest management is an evolving concept, which is fair enough. However, the Rio declaration is very comprehensive and allows for that flexibility. It sets out broad principles and parameters, which represent the highest expression of how we should do it right. It takes in all the aspects, including cultural, environmental, tourist and economic value. I want that approach hardwired into the structures which will work with the Government, if one likes, in terms of managing our forests in a sustainable way. I do not see why the Minister of State would not accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> The Minister of State's amendment states there should be "an appropriate balance between members who are men and who are women". That is an interesting inclusion and a good one. He is happy to be specific on that balance. Should he not be equally happy to be specific on the other balances? It is absolutely right to specify that gender balance, but he has not included the other social, economic and environmental balances, which are equally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> At the risk of labouring a point we have discussed at length, I believe it is just a recent example of it. We could also talk about the refinery in north Mayo and the major conflict that caused. Coillte lands were used in a way that caused huge division in the community and certainly the community would maintain there was not adequate consultation with it about what was done. Equally in the more recent example of Gougane Barra, the Minister of State did not outline the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">The Minister of State has justified it on the basis of urgency because of the spread of the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> I am not an expert in this regard but the first indication of disease in Gougane Barra was in July 2013 and the announcement that 16,000 trees would be cut down was made in January. Why were the intervening six months not used for public consultation? That was plenty of time for a comprehensive public consultation to consider the entire issue. Subsequently, it was discovered that it was not just larch that was cut down, as other species were also felled. I acknowledge I do not know but I received a letter from someone who claims to be knowledgeable in this area, which showed pictures of diseased trees where the disease was active and live and those trees were completely decrepit. This person also sent me photographs of the trees that were felled in Gougane Barra, which clearly were not affected by the disease. Questions have been raised and while I do not know whether these suspicions are justified, one way in which this suspicion - or massive conflict and controversy as seen in north County Mayo - can be overcome is to have public consultation. I simply do not accept that one cannot have genuine public consultation without causing unnecessary delays, as to have a proper public consultation is not really about time but is about will. Six months was plenty of time in which to have public consultation but it simply did not happen. Moreover, this concerned a national park of huge importance and perhaps is symptomatic of a problem in respect of decisions that are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> That is the case for this amendment, which proposes that this working group should be balanced, should be informed by principles of sustainable forest management and that the Minister should not simply be allowed to do what he or she wants. It is a reasonable proposal, which I hope the Minister of State will accept, and I intend to press this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1257">During the consideration of an amendment proposed on Committee Stage by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I indicated that I would look again at this provision with a view to introducing flexibility and balanced representation on committees set up under the legislation. I believe my amendment achieves such flexibility. It allows for the appointment of people with the relevant expertise to a committee, having regard to the particular terms of reference of that committee. The advantage of this is obvious, allowing as it would for the utilisation of leading experts in the fields of interest which the committees have been established to examine or report upon. My amendment also acknowledges and has regard to the diverse nature of forestry and the different stakeholder interests ranging from the contractors, consultants and businesses that propagate, plant and fell trees, through to the sawmills that process the timber and the environmental non-governmental organisations whose objective is to protect the environment. It seeks to ensure these diverse interests and views are represented on such committees. It also recognises the need for gender balance in the composition of the committee. This is in line with the commitment given in the programme for Government and the national policy on gender equality that requires all public bodies to take due note of equality in carrying out their functions and to increasing the role of women in decision-making.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1258">While I appreciate the Minister of State has tabled an amendment to respond to the concerns raised, it is too qualified. I wish to press this matter because it relates concretely to how the Government and the Minister will be influenced by the right balance of stakeholders in forestry. The amendment tabled by the Minister of State states: "the Minister shall give due consideration to the desirability of the committee’s membership reflecting the social, economic and environmental interests". In other words, the Minister will consider whether it is desirable to have a balance. That is pretty weak, as how could it not be desirable to have a balance? The Minister should not have the discretion to decide he or she does not wish to have a balance but only wants the industry people. This is how the Minister of State's amendment is worded, whereas the amendment I tabled states there must be a balance. The Minister of State's amendment correctly provides for a balance between men and women, which is very specific, but on the issue of the balance in respect of social, economic and environmental factors, it is up to the Minister as to whether he or she will have a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259"> That is a way out of having a balance and this is not simply an abstract argument because there are serious questions about the model of forestry that is being pursued and whether too often, albeit not in all circumstances, the model being pursued is one that does not really engage properly with the public and does not take on board alternative points of view. Moreover, it is overly geared, and I suspect will become ever-increasingly geared, towards the interests of big developers in industrial wind turbines, industrialised biomass or whatever it might be. While I acknowledge they also have the right to a voice, too often it is that voice which dominates and the community and environmental concerns get lost, as do the other social, cultural and heritage interests and perspectives, to the detriment of our natural resources. This is the basis on which I intend to press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1260">The ideal make-up of any committee will be determined by the tasks to be assigned. I have had the opportunity to set up committees in the past and will provide the Deputy with an example. On foot of the major storm that occurred earlier this year, I set up a windblow task force, to which I assigned different people from the industry who had knowledge on how to deal with it. It was a really effective committee and I intend to continue with it, because it acts as a great advisory group and has achieved a lot within a short timeframe. The forest liaison group is a different group in which environmental people are involved. It is my intention at all times to have a balanced representation and it is inherent in what I have already stated that I would get people with expertise from the various fields that are needed for the different committees that might be set up, when needed, on an ongoing basis. One cannot include precisely in legislation that one will put in so many representatives from the environmental sector, so many contractors and so on. As the Deputy is aware, it would not make for good representation. However, the thrust of the amendment I have tabled is to put people on committees that reflect all viewpoints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261"> As for the land availability group, while I would love to have received a report from it some time ago, this has not happened because there are disagreements on issues and it is hard to bring it to a conclusion. Although I would have liked to have received a report from it faster, because of the differing viewpoints it has taken a long time to get it. Moreover, there are times when one can set up groups that can be cumbersome or difficult to manage. Consequently, to aim for efficiency and as good a balance as one can get always is the best way to do it in order to run it in a more efficient way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">However, I believe there will be huge pressures on all Ministers, present and future, in this area. Sadly, the media are not terribly interested in this debate as it no longer is controversial because Coillte will not be sold. However, I believe that as a big milestone is the potential merger of Coillte with Bord na Móna and what this may mean.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">It involves substantial resources, the value and importance of which will increase at every level. The value of these resources is understood in some quarters, for example, in banks which invest heavily in forests. In the aftermath of a period of financial speculation on a virtual economy and the economic crash, there is an increasing awareness of the value of real things such as natural resources. Forestry is an extremely important resource and, as such, future Ministers will come under severe pressure from industry, multinational companies and many other sectors that wish to exploit our natural resources. Against that background, we must set in legislation a requirement to establish a consultative committee with genuinely balanced and broad representation, with which the Minister would consult in deciding how to approach this issue and deal with the pressures he or she will face. This is necessary to ensure citizens, communities, history and heritage do not lose out. </p>
          <p eId="para_1266"> I have not taken an inflexible approach. My amendment does not specify that the committee must include a certain number of environmentalists, trade unions, members of walking groups, etc. It offers the Minister flexibility, while spelling out that he or she must establish a committee with balanced representation whose approach, broadly speaking, would be informed by the Rio principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267"> I will press the amendment because the decision on this issue will have significant consequences for the management of forestry. I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting it, although I am certain he will not do so. </p>

          <p eId="para_1389">I move amendment No. 28:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1390">In page 11, line 11, after “law” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1391">“, save where such disclosures may be deemed to be in the public interest, particularly where such disclosures are made in the interests of sustainable forest management”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392"> This amendment concerns disclosures and confidentiality. One could call it a whistle-blower's amendment. Section 9(1) states: "Save as otherwise provided by law, a person shall not, without the consent of the Minister, disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing, or as a result of having performed, duties as a member of a committee unless he or she is duly authorised to do so." Therefore the Minister has the right to silence or impose confidentiality on the committee. That may or may not be justified in some circumstances, but that power for the Minister to impose confidentiality has to be qualified. My amendment provides that it should be qualified "save where such disclosures may be deemed to be in the public interest, particularly where such disclosures are made in the interests of sustainable forest management".</p>
          <p eId="para_1393"> This is important because, as we know, we have had too much secrecy in State institutions in general, which has cost our society dearly in a range of institutions and sectors. They include the financial sector, schools, churches and various State institutions. The secret society approach to running an economy, a society or a state has to end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">This is something the Government has indicated should happen. We need greater accountability and transparency, and to encourage whistle blowing when it is in the interest of society. It follows logically that the Minister should not have the power to unconditionally impose confidentiality clauses. If a member of the relevant committee believes it is in the public interest and in the interest of sustainable forest management to blow the whistle, he or she should not be prohibited from doing so. That is a general reason why the Government should accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395"> There are concerns about the decision making process in the forestry sector, particularly by the biggest owner of forests in this country, Coillte, and its impact on the national forest estate and adjoining communities. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has pointed out that a lot of people are doing a lot of good work in Coillte. I recognise that Coillte employs a considerable number of dedicated people who love what they do and care passionately about our forests. However, one could say that about many dysfunctional institutions. There were lots of good people in the church and I am sure they did a lot of good work. There were also some not so good people who did terrible things. The culture of secrecy meant that whistles were not blown when terrible things happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> This is an important debate. I did not get an answer to my question on why Coillte is not subject to freedom of information. The Minister of State indicated that the Bill is not about Coillte but it is about forestry and Coillte owns half of our forests. It is by far the biggest owner of forests and it has a decisive influence on forestry nationally. It is odd, therefore, that it would not be subject to freedom of information. In the debate on Irish Water, the Government conceded on its initial plan to exclude that company from freedom of information. I do not see why the same argument should not apply to Coillte. Why would it not be subject to freedom of information?</p>
          <p eId="para_1397"> The Minister of State also did not respond to my point that Coillte employees have a confidentiality clause, which means that if they are concerned about certain aspects of what might be happening in the organisation, their contracts of employment precludes them from speaking about their concerns. If we want to give strength to the many good people who work in Coillte, we need to give them legal backing if they decide to speak out about what is going on in this big organisation, which controls 7% of the landmass of this State. The argument that we need greater levels of transparency and accountability is unanswerable. Any power the Minister might have to impose confidentiality has to be qualified in the way this amendment suggests.</p>

          <p eId="para_1398">In the context of our consideration of this amendment on Committee Stage, I indicated that I would consider the public interest issue in consultation with my legal advisers and, if necessary, review the section further before Report Stage. My advice is that the words "or as provided by law" in the existing text of section 9(1) already accommodates the amendment's aims in respect of public interest in that it encompasses the range of legislative provisions that deal with releases of information. The important point is that confidential information may only be released by the Minister or as provided for by law. This encompasses the personal information which cannot generally be released in the public interest because personal rights are enshrined in the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. On the other hand, the release of commercially sensitive information is covered in the Freedom of Information Acts. All the aforementioned legislative provisions are included in the subsection by reference to "provided by law". In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1399">I would like to hear other opinions on this subject. Does the Minister of State mean that if a member of a committee who advises him on forest management hears something that does not concern personal information, is in line with the law and is a cause for serious concern in the context of the public interest and the sustainable management of our forests, he or she will have the legal right to blow the whistle? I want clarity on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1402">I will press the amendment, although I will not seek a vote on it. I am not terribly happy with the Minister of State's reply because it is somewhat evasive. The Minister of State cannot speak again but perhaps his officials could just nod. If a disclosure is allowed by law and the whistleblower legislation allows for the disclosure, the Minister would not be able to override permission? I welcome that the Government is introducing legal supports for whistleblowers but I want an assurance that the Minister's power to demand confidentiality cannot override people's legal right to be whistleblowers. It is not clear to me whether that assurance for people to blow the whistle when it is in the public interest to do so is provided for.</p>

          <p eId="para_1405">The difference between us may not be as great as it would appear. I understand that the law would not permit the release of confidential or commercially sensitive information under freedom of information. In normal circumstances, it would also not be permissible to release personal information on an individual. Am I correct in saying, however, that if a whistleblower law allows the whistle to be blown in certain circumstances, it would be legally possible to make that information available?</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">In other words, there would be restrictions from freedom of information law on one hand, with normal restrictions on personal information, while on the other hand there would be the possibility of releasing information if a whisteblower law allowed it. Is that the balance we are trying to strike?</p>

          <p eId="para_1415">I refer to amendments Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive. I appreciate the idea behind amendment No. 29, substituting "should" for "may", is positive towards forestry management planning but the use of the word "may" is more appropriate to this section. For this reason, I do not agree with the proposed amendment. Forest sizes can vary from small to very large and it is important that this provision is flexible enough to allow for a selective approach to requirements for a forestry management plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416"> With regard to amendments Nos. 30 and 31, I draw Deputies' attention to section 10(6), where the provision is made for the making of regulations to provide for the form, content, duration and implementation of plans. In drafting such regulation, a Minister must have regard to the doctrine of proportionality, in particular that any requirement he or she proposes would not be disproportionate to the objectives sought and that constitutional rights of citizens would be protected. Furthermore, such regulation cannot go beyond the principles and policies set down in the Bill. It is implicit in the text of the Bill and prior to the drafting of regulations that the reasons for such measures would be outlined in advance. The intention is to make management plans as user-friendly as possible and my Department will provide templates and guidelines to facilitate this process. I accept the spirit in which the amendments are proposed but it is not necessary to include them in the text. I do not accept amendments Nos. 30 and 31.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417"> With regard to amendment No. 32, it is not necessary to provide this level of scrutiny for all proposed secondary legislation and I do not accept this amendment. In the context of section 25, dealing with power to charge and recover fees, I will introduce amendment No. 64 to allow for parliamentary scrutiny of any proposal that may emerge to charge fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_1429">This relates to the Minister's safeguarding of the environment, the requirement that the Minister should take into account the social, economic and environmental functions of forestry and follow the best forest practice. Many points have already been made in previous discussions on other amendments but one cannot overstate the importance of this being a requirement of the Minister rather than just something he or she should consider. The value of forests is varied and often the forestry model applied here - as I and others have said - is too narrow. We need to broaden our understanding of forestry. We have discussed this and the Minister of State has indicated we should discuss it further after we finish debating this Bill. He has informally suggested that we could have statements on how to develop forestry, and no matter what occurs with this Bill and amendments, that would be a welcome development. Many people want some input into how we develop the forestry model in this country to its potential. Some feel that the current model being pursued is too narrow and does not fully realise its potential. Some people would argue there are serious threats to forestry because we are pursuing too narrow a model at times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430"> This amendment comes from the idea that the Minister should not just have regard to this issue but it should be required that he or she would take into account the economic, environmental and social impact on forestry and follow the best forest practice rather than just good forest practice, which is not really defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">It should be defined specifically by national forest policy and by national forest standards. We are trying to be more specific about the meaning of “best forest practice”, which is not always terribly well defined. It is too vague and therefore one can define it any way one likes. Our definitions of these things need to be tighter. </p>

          <p eId="para_1432">I appreciate the Deputy’s intention in this amendment which seeks to ensure that the social, economic and environmental functions of forests are maintained at all times. The proposed amendment, however, would place an unrealistic and unobtainable obligation on the Minister because it is simply not possible to ensure that these often competing functions are maintained at all times. For example, it is sometimes necessary to restrict the economic functions of a forest in order to facilitate its environmental functions. This may be the case in limited circumstances where the timing of felling may be temporarily delayed due to the presence of protected species. The existing text in this section obliges the Minister to have regard to the social, economic and environmental functions of forestry in the performance of his or her functions. This enables the Minister to strike an appropriate balance between these functions by means of policy and by way of other measures provided for in this Bill, consequently I cannot accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433"> Amendment No. 34 seeks to require the Minister to lead by reference to a national policy and national standards. That would be too restrictive. The existing reference to good forest practice is preferable because it is sufficiently broad to allow the Minister to take account of national and international policy and standards for good forest practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1434">The broadness and vagueness concern me. The Minister of State needs flexibility and cannot be absolutely tied down to, or hamstrung by, every last detail but if the policy and standards are good and are informed by a sustainable approach to forestry, some of the clashes and conflicts the Minister of State alludes to do not come into play. There is often a false tension between what is viewed as the economic approach to forestry and the heritage or environmental approach. I am arguing on behalf of environmental groups and people who are passionate about, and interested in, forestry, who know more than I do and who say it is possible to have the best of all possible worlds. If it is done right the unique feature of sustainable forestry is that one can achieve and maximise all of the ends, economic, social, cultural, heritage or whatever. To set them against one another is wrong. If the Minister of State has the right policies and standards and applies those, the clashes do not have to exist.</p>

          <p eId="para_1459">We discussed this on Committee Stage. I am proposing to allow the Minister to require "ecological surveys of any afforestation sites" to be carried out. I am not sure we have made the point that the cutting down of trees and the carrying out of other activities in or close to forests are not the only things that can be problematic. The wrong type of afforestation, or inappropriate afforestation, can be problematic as well. Perhaps we should require the Minister to consider the impact the particular type of trees being planted may have at all sorts of levels. It is important to reflect on the impact of certain types of trees on the local environment, wildlife, soil, local communities and the broad ecology of a locality. I have often discussed people's concern about the reasons for cutting down trees and their belief that they should not have been cut down. We should bear in mind that when forests are being developed, communities are often concerned that the wrong types of trees are being planted. Obviously, this relates to the ongoing debate about the excessive focus on sitka spruce as a single species and the impact that such a monoculture can have on ecology. That is the logic behind this amendment, which would empower citizens who are concerned about the impact of particular approaches to forestry on the local ecology, native woodlands and existing woodlands by giving them the right to petition for ecological surveys to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1460">As I have previously indicated, there is already an established framework under the European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations 2010, whereby prior to any approval being issued, my Department must determine whether an initial afforestation project is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the environment and complete a screening to determine whether an environmental impact statement is required. As part of this process, my Department regularly consults other agencies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland, local authorities and An Taisce. Provision is also made for the general public to make submissions on the likely environmental effects of any such projects. These environmental impact assessment procedures are complemented by the appropriate assessment procedure operated by the Department under the birds and habitats regulation, whereby all forestry projects which require a licence are evaluated to determine whether there is a possibility that the project might have a significant effect on the conservation objectives and the qualifying interests of the Natura 2000 sites. If it is determined that there is a possibility of a significant effect on a Natura 2000 site, the applicant must submit a Natura impact statement to my Department before a decision is made on whether to issue a licence or approval. I remain of the view that the protection of the environment is already sufficiently addressed by this Bill and other legislation. I do not propose to accept this amendment. I remind the Deputy, in response to his point about making provision for concerned citizens to petition the Minister, that provision is already made in existing forestry legislation for concerned citizens to participate in the decision-making process with regard to forestry. Amendment No. 61a, in my name, will empower the Minister to make regulations to introduce further measures to improve public participation in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1461">I would like to elaborate briefly on the logic behind this amendment. I want to underline that I am by no means a scientific expert in this area. I would like to comment on the whole issue of disease without getting into the rights and wrongs of the Gougane Barra issue. There has been some speculation about certain diseases which are beginning to appear here, in England and in other parts of Europe. I refer to diseases that we did not appear to have much of before now. I was reading an article about the ramorum issue. As far as I understand it, we did not really have it here before. They did not have it in England until relatively recently. The Minister of State's officials probably know more about it. Perhaps the point is that it was limited to different species. There is speculation that it is hitting new species after being imported into Ireland and Britain because we are planting particular types of species that might not be appropriate. One of the consequences of the spread of these diseases is that we have to cut down loads of trees. This example shows why we need to be careful about the potential impact of afforestation projects on our native woodlands. That is the point of this amendment. It seems reasonable that people who are concerned about these issues should have the right to petition to ensure the possible ecological impact on native woodlands is studied properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1462">I will be brief. I do not want to open up another debate on this issue. Everything is already in place. The National Parks and Wildlife Service and all the different agencies are asked for their opinions. Those opinions are always discussed. One is always concerned about disease. One must always take every step to prevent disease. Ash dieback, for example, is a new disease that we have relatively little information on. The Department, with the support of the other agencies, is continuing to try to find disease-resistant trees. One has to look for other ways to deal with these matters. One has to take the best advice available at the time to deal with these issues.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1466">"(4) On proof by the owner of the land concerned that the steps taken in relation to that land by a person authorised under <i>subsection (2) </i>needlessly resulted in damage or loss of a significant character to that owner in respect of that land, the person so authorised shall be liable to pay compensation to him or her therefor and, if the person so authorised is not the owner of the trees referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, the person shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the owner of the trees in respect of any payment the person has properly made to the first-mentioned owner under this subsection.".</p>

						</b>are replicated in amendments Nos. 41d, 41e and 41f.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468"> Amendments Nos. 41a and 41d arise as a consequence of legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that provision should be made for payment of compensation to a landowner whose land has been entered for the purpose of removal of vegetation or vermin from that land and where such action has needlessly resulted in damage or loss to the owner of that land. The compensation is payable by the person who was authorised to enter the land. Compensation will not be payable by the Minister. Amendments Nos. 41b, 41c, 41e and 41f are grammatical changes and make no material change to the subsection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469"> Amendment No. 71a introduces a new section to deal with compensation. Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage there was lengthy discussion on the need for the Bill to provide for payment of compensation in circumstances where there is refusal of an application for a felling licence. In light of those concerns, particularly from Deputy McNamara, who fought a lengthy argument on this issue, I sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General in the matter and the advice I received was that there would be a risk of a finding that the provisions of the Bill permitting refusals of felling licences would be unconstitutional if they failed to provide for compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470"> The purpose of this proposed amendment, for which I have received Government approval, is to give effect to this legal advice to provide for compensation where it is legally necessary to do so. While the outright refusal of an application for approval or licence is infrequent, there are, and will continue to be, instances where an approval or a licence may be refused by the Minister, usually for reasons of environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471"> It is intended that compensation will be provided through regulations to be made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine which will require the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The proposed amendment limits the circumstances in which compensation will be payable. In the case of refusal of a felling licence or forest road licence, compensation will be limited to the depreciation in the value of the trees that is attributable to the deterioration in the quality of the timber as a consequence of the refusal. This is similar to the provision included in Northern Ireland and UK legislation. Restrictions on the payment of compensation are also listed, including where a licence is refused for environmental reasons, for example, in a designated nature conservation area or for reasons of public health or safety.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1474">I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment and listening to what some of us argued on Committee Stage. It improves the Bill in many regards. The amendment introduces compensation in cases where an afforestation permit is refused, where a felling licence is refused or where a forest road is refused. That is welcome because the refusal of any of those is an interference with the property right. In certain circumstances our Constitution requires compensation for an interference with a property right. However, it is not just our Constitution which requires that. It is also required by the European Convention on Human Rights, which is incorporated into Irish law to the extent it is by the Human Rights Act. The European Convention on Human Rights is also incorporated into British law. It was for that reason, and I refer to the committee debates in Northern Ireland, compensation was provided in the event that a felling licence is refused in Northern Ireland. That was pointed out to the Minister on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475"> My clear understanding is that this compensation was introduced in Northern Ireland not necessarily because the State wanted to introduce it but the State felt it was required to be introduced to be compliant with the Human Rights Act. The property rights protections in the European Convention on Human Rights are broadly the same as the property rights in our Constitution. There is extensive case law on this matter to interpret those protections. Undoubtedly, it is possible to interfere with those property rights in the common good. The Constitution clearly states that. I refer to one of the leading academic commentaries on the Irish Constitution, the first edition of which was by the late John Kelly, a Fine Gael Deputy. The current edition states that it will be noticed that the cases presented so far sometimes referred to compensation as an element which may validate or make acceptable constitutionally what would otherwise be an objectionable inroad on private property or the absence of compensation as an element confirming the injustice of the interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476"> For all those reasons I welcome that the Minister has introduced an amendment to these matters but amendment No. 71a hollows out the compensation provisions. It states that the Minister may introduce a statutory instrument to compensate for these matters but the Minister, by statutory instrument, will be able to refuse compensation if the refusal is based on certain reasons, and those refusals are very broad. If the refusal is because of environmental concerns, health and safety, a fear of interference with water quality or best forestry practice, and we heard earlier in the Chamber that best forestry practice is an evolving concept, there will be no compensation. It is difficult to understand how anyone could be refused for any reasons other than the reasons contained in the provisions. They are so broad it means that one is entitled to compensation, but one will not get compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477"> I have no problem with a refusal to grant an afforestation permit being excluded from compensation if it is for any of these reasons because that is more or less already provided in the Planning Act. If one is refused permission to build an estate of houses on one's land, one is not entitled to compensation for it because it is for the common good but I have a major problem with one aspect, and I question how it could be constitutional. If someone is issued an afforestation permit, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine can tell that person to go ahead and plant their ten, 100 or 1,000 acres of land and he or she will examine whether that is in the common good in terms of the environment, water quality and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">The State gives permission to do this, but it must be borne in mind that this affects not only the property rights but the right to earn a living. Say, for example that after having invested one's livelihood it has been 70 years since one planted as a young man and having reached the ripe old age of 90 and having thought one would never see such a day, one decides to realise the investment. At that point the legislation as framed allows the Minister to intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479"> I am not particularly worried that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has the power because, as we have already discussed, he is a benign Minister. However, this law will be there for future generations and it will give a future Minister the right to say that he or she has changed his or her mind. Moreover, because it is in the interests of best forestry practice which has evolved considerably over the years or because the reasons are environmental the Minister can then decide one cannot harvest those trees for which the State gave the person concerned the afforestation permit. The fact that there is no compensation for that, not the fact that a future Minister would be allowed to refuse a permit to fell those trees, but the fact that he or she can do so without providing compensation, seems contrary to what the Minister of State hopes to achieve by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480"> I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, not today but on the last occasion this Bill was discussed on Report Stage, state that one of the objectives of this Bill was to get those who own a marginal piece of land to think about afforesting it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1482">That is an objective on which we both are agreed. I completely support the Minister of State on that, as I broadly support him on this Bill, but I do not see how somebody who owns a marginal piece of land could be encouraged to plant it if the Minister is saying that he will allow the person to plant it because it is marginal, he or she will get a considerable return on investment over 70 years as it is not great land in that one cannot graze it half of the time. The Minister may even encourage planting by making it easier to jump through the hoops to determine whether or not it is feasible to plant in terms of whether it is environmentally beneficial, the water is suitable and the character of the landscape is suitable. Yet he may refuse an afforestation permit, the refusal of which I do not have a problem with because there are lands that are suitable for afforestation and lands that are not. However, once the Minister or any State actor gives someone an afforestation permit to invest in this, tie up the person's livelihood, and his or her family's livelihood and the possibility of earning money from this piece of land which is the person's private property, how can a future Minister, say 70 years later or, if they are growing it for hurleys, even ten or 20 years later, state that the State has changed its mind? One of the most basic requirements for any investment is certainty, for example, the certainty that if one buys a house one will be able to live in it or if one grows a crop of mangles or potatoes one will be able to harvest them and use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483"> What the Minister of State is saying to those with marginal land is that he would like them to plant it but he will not tell them for sure that they will be able to access the crop because he retains the right to deny them access to it. That is fine because it is in the common good. However, it is not in the interests of best forestry practice to do so and exclude the right to compensation. I would have severe doubts as to how it could be constitutional because, as I stated, it interferes with the property right, albeit in the common good, but without the right to compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484"> I welcome that the Minister of State addressed this and other concerns which were raised on Committee Stage, not only by me but by other members of the committee. That is more broadly indicative of the approach of the Department rather than the Minister of State because his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, adopted a similar approach in seeking to achieve consensus on the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. It is much appreciated because, ultimately, the Constitution states we all are here to make law even if sometimes our constituents, or even we ourselves, think we are here for other reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485"> I do not want to labour the point. I welcome the amendment the Minister of State is introducing, amendment No. 71a. I would have doubts about some of the wording of it. It is a little awkward. Leaving that aside my major concern would be that while it introduces a compensation requirement - I argued on Committee Stage that a compensation requirement was required to make it constitutional - it is then hollowed out by the reasons that one will not receive compensation. That would be my concern, that it does not encourage landowners to afforest their land. Moreover, I would have doubts about its constitutionality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486"> Before the Minister of State responds I appreciate everything that he has done to address the concerns. I thank him for having arranged a meeting with some representatives of his staff, who, I know, have taken legal advice. I know that their legal advice is that this is sound. I also know that the Minister of State is not bound to take legal advice from some backbencher. I appreciate that, and I would not expect him to. As an elected representative, my view is that this does not encourage forestry and that it is possibly unconstitutional. I would like to see it tested at some stage. I would have my doubts about how it will go. Nobody can predict with certain how anything will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487"> I appreciate the Minister of State's efforts. I am not seeking to denigrate them. However, the end result is still a concern to me, that a person can be given a permit, can be told it is okay to plant a piece of land, ties it up for as much as 70 years and at the end of that 70 years, when the person thinks that he or she has put this aside and the investment is there for the person and his or her children, the person could be refused permission to cut the trees. This on the basis that the Forestry Bill passed in 2014 states that if the Minister refuses such a person for environmental reasons, because of water quality, etc., he or she does not have to compensate him or her. In consequence, the Minister is refusing the person in this instance and will not provide compensation. Those are my concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_1488">I listened with interest to Deputy McNamara's contribution on compensation for those who are compliant with the permit at any given time. I am a little confused. He mentioned where somebody goes for planning permission, gets planning permission and is compliant with planning permission rules. We had a Minister in here who disregarded that. I refer to the septic tank charges, if the Minister of State recalls. Those who were compliant in 1984, 1986, 1994 and right through, because of the EPA guidelines, would not be compliant now. I acknowledge Deputy McNamara's argument on what has gone before. I have always been of the opinion that if the septic tank issue was challenged constitutionally it would not succeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1489">I find Deputy McNamara’s argument quite compelling. When I think about it, it is similar to one of the amendments I had tabled, which was ruled out of order because it could involve a charge on the Exchequer, that would ensure financial recognition for forest owners who did not harvest a crop in the interest of European designations or good environmental management. It is about encouraging people to engage in forestry but also to ensure that those who the State hopes will develop forestry will have some guarantee that they will not be at a loss for doing so. I would like to see the State forestry company, Coillte, significantly contribute to afforestation. There needs to be a debate about its incapacity to do so with EU rules and so forth. Given that the Government’s focus is about encouraging private farmers to move into forestry in a larger way-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1491">Yes, but we also have an imperative to ensure we have good, environmentally protective, best practices in forestry. Deputy McNamara has a good point about a farmer who decides to afforest marginal land but discovers 40 years later that he cannot harvest it and will not get any financial recognition for contributing to the overall environmental welfare. Farmers are right and justified in seeking the assurance that if that were to happen - as Deputy McNamara said it could for a very good reason - then they will be compensated. It is a reasonable argument.</p>

          <p eId="para_1492">We have spent much time discussing this important aspect of the Bill. This Bill intends to encourage landowners across the country to plant more forestry in marginal land. Up to 6,500 hectares are planted every year but the programme for Government calls for up to 14,000 hectares. As a landowner myself, I know opting for forestry is a significant commitment. If a farmer changes from breeding one stock to another, for example, it can easily be reversed. Forestry, however, is a commitment for many years. This legislation will make it amenable for landowners to make a decision to move into forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493"> We are all agreed about the benefits of afforestation to rural communities. Only last week, I visited Munster Joinery’s factory in Cork, a firm which employs over 1,000 people in rural areas. There is no industry that I know that can generate such good and environmentally sound employment in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494"> All Members who have contributed to this amendment have made strong points on the issue in question. However, we have received legal opinion from the Attorney General on this which caused a delay in the Bill’s progress. While I would have liked to have the Bill enacted earlier, it is important it is done right. As a Minister, I cannot go against the legal advice of the Attorney General to the Government. This amendment has been drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel on foot of that advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1495">We agree on much more than we differ on. All of us, including Deputies Boyd Barrett and Ferris, agree afforestation is a good development with significant environmental benefits. The Woodland League, with which I have been in contact, argues some of the earlier afforestation programmes were not beneficial. Back in the days when there were not the stringent requirements there are now to get an afforestation permit, planting was done - in good faith - on marginal lands, many of which were not capable of sustaining even trees. Now, it is more difficult to get an afforestation permit, which is a good development. It tells people we do not want them to waste their resources growing a crop on unsustainable land.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496"> I am not arguing people should be compensated when their land is unsuitable for forestry. In the same way, people refused planning permission for a house because it might interfere with the environment or other guidelines in place for the common good should not be compensated. However, take the case of a person getting planning permission for a house from a local authority, spending a lot of money building it, only to be then told by the local authority that they cannot live in it because it has changed its mind on what is desirable and what is not. That is what I fear will be introduced by this amendment. I welcome the general compensation requirement, as it is an improvement to the 1946 Forestry Act. We should not be introducing laws unless we are improving on what was there before. It is the broad exclusions from compensation, however, that cause me concern. It concerns me that a landowner can go to much trouble to get an afforestation permit but the State can turn around at some point in the future and deny the landowner the opportunity to harvest that crop without recourse to compensation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1499">In these Houses all of us pledge allegiance to the 1916 Proclamation that hangs in the foyer. Therefore, we believe in a republic - a new republic - one where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, disability, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, where they live or what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500"> Creating the conditions for establishing an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups and sections of society need enhanced protection from the State. In my time in the Dáil, and for a number of years before I was elected, I have witnessed cut after cut to those living with disabilities and those who love them and care for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501"> A total of 26 disability organisations saw their funding, through the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, run by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, revoked on 30 June. That is disgraceful. Our citizens deserve better. The Government must restore €1.2 million in funding lost to disability organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502"> I echo some of the comments made by the Disability Federation of Ireland today. It expressed concern that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for implementing the national disability strategy, was apparently not aware of the serious cut implemented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. It also expressed concern that the Minister of State no longer comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and that there might be a disconnect between her disability and equality portfolios. The Government must be aware of that. I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, will examine the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503"> The Disability Federation of Ireland has also asked that the Government consider the appointment of a senior Minister for disability inclusion. Having just completed a reshuffle and rearranged some ministerial portfolios I do not assume the Government will do that immediately but in the absence of such a change I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to examine the issue. There is ongoing concern on the matter among the disability community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504"> I urge him also to secure a commitment from the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, his party colleague and deputy leader, to overturn the cuts and restore funding to those important organisations. They are providing critical front-line service to people who are most in need of them. We must do the right thing by disabled citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505"> I have said it before in this House and I will say it again tonight, that we need a "threshold of decency" on disability supports and a political consensus that people with disabilities would have their dignity and rights maintained and that their families would not be abandoned as a result of ongoing cutbacks. We will not allow those with disabilities and their carers and families to endure cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506"> I remind Members of this House of the imagery from 2012 of citizens with profound disabilities protesting outside Leinster House at the cuts imposed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and how that struck a chord with people. The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality. The Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities in this State, and their families and carers. Their broken promises on disabilities are the cruellest of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507"> The previous Government cut the disability allowance, carer's allowance and carer's benefit, and the blind person's allowance, not once but twice. The removal of the Christmas double payments also heavily impacted on the disabled and their families and carers. As a result, the Government cut the income of disabled people and their carers by 10% over two budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508"> In my time as a Member of this House, and also previously as a councillor, I have engaged more with adults and children who have disabilities and that has been a real eye-opener for me. Life is hard but it is even harder for some of those people and their families. It is not just difficult for those with a disability; it is incredibly difficult for their loved ones around them. It is physically hard and emotionally draining. They are at the coalface. They are the ones who campaign day in and day out in their own ways for their loved ones to have the same standard of living as they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509"> Many of the speakers last night pointed out that it is also financially difficult for people with disabilities. We know that half of those with disabilities experience income poverty and more than one third experience basic deprivation. Since 2008, the sector has faced a 14% cut imposed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510"> I would like the Minister of State to inform me why Ireland has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Surely that should have been done some time ago as we signed the convention in March 2007. Could he please tell me the reason for the delay? Could he also indicate when the Government will do the decent thing and introduce equality budgeting? In July 2013 Sinn Féin introduced the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013. The Bill sought to amend the existing legislation and aimed to provide for equality proofing of Government policy and budgets and public bodies through impact assessments. Had the Bill been accepted and passed, it would have ensured that both the Government and public bodies in exercising their functions would do so in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage. The Bill recognises those additional sectors of society which require enhanced protection from the State in relation to policy and spending decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511"> We all know that times are hard in this country but what some of us fail to recognise is just how difficult they are for some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society. The Government came to office on a wave of promises in 2011 but soon afterwards it became apparent that many of its plans involved taking from some of the most vulnerable. Often, in order to create true equality we have to put the mechanisms in place to ensure that happens. This is one of those times. By using equality budgeting, we would ensure equality is placed well and truly at the centre of any decisions concerning public expenditure and income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512"> Equality budgeting has been internationally accepted as a means to deal effectively with inequality and poverty. Worldwide, more than 60 countries have adopted or are working towards equality budgeting. The time has come for Ireland to follow suit, to make a stand and provide a more just and equitable society for all. It is our duty as republicans - Sinn Féin does not claim ownership of the description "republican". Everyone who pledges allegiance to the 1916 Proclamation, and believes in the values and principles inherent in it, is a republican. All of us who are republicans have a responsibility to consider equality budgeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513"> I endorse the vision for people with disabilities from the Disability Federation of Ireland. It called on the Government to take urgent action on three key areas. First, it urged the Government to halt reductions in the basic standard of living of people with disabilities requiring welfare supports. People with disabilities are most likely to experience real poverty because on top of the recent cuts in benefit levels and new charges, they also have to continue to pay for extras required due to their disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514"> Second, the Government must ensure funding for the services needed by people with disabilities. Cutting the services required by people with disabilities not only undermines their lives, it also leads to a growing public burden in terms of hospital stays and expensive care costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515"> Third, the Government must publish and show leadership on an ambitious implementation plan for the national disability strategy in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where people have dignity, individual autonomy and full and effective participation in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516"> That is the vision and the achievable goals the organisation has set out. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, believes in equality and is committed to it. I wish him well in his new brief. I will work constructively with him to achieve the goals we share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">I commend Deputy Finian McGrath on bringing forward this motion, which we will support.</p>

          <p eId="para_1519">I join others in congratulating my colleague and friend, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, on his appointment to the position of Minister of State and wish him well in the role. I know he will bring his great depth of professional experience working with young people and his political experience to the role and he will do an outstanding and committed job. I also welcome this motion, tabled by Deputy Finian McGrath and his colleagues, as anything that brings this sensitive and important subject to the floor of the House must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520"> It is a cliché to say that the manner in which a society engages with disabled people indicates the progress of that society, its political activity and democracy generally, but it is true. The amendment to the motion cites some figures and I want to read them into the record again. The Government spends almost €5 billion every year on disability services and €1 billion on income supports relating to illness and invalidity. The health service provided some €1.4 billion in 2014 for health and social services for people with disabilities. These figures include residential services for over 9,000 people, day services for 22,000 people, respite residential services for 6,000 people, 1.6 million hours of personal assistant home support, €7 million for additional places for school leavers, €3 million for emergency residential placements and €4 million for the development of services for children with disabilities. It is important in a rational debate that these figures go on the record, in light of some contributions from the other side of the House. The disability sector has always been a priority for this Government and remains so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1521"> There is no point in evading the fact that this country experienced a horrendous recession that left us on the point of bankruptcy. As a consequence of the recession many people suffered enormously and a disproportionate amount of this suffering was experienced by people with disabilities. Happily, through visionary and prudent financial management, we are emerging from the recession. In the first quarter of the year we saw 2.7% growth and 60,000 jobs have been created in the past year. Income tax returns are up 10% and retail wages are up 3%. It behoves us to concentrate resources on those with disabilities and to exercise positive discrimination favouring disabled people who took the sharpest edge off the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522"> The low pay commission that is part of renewed Government priorities is significant for people with disabilities because those who are employed are often in low-paid jobs. The newly established Government priorities for 2014 to 2016 will result in the implementation of the value for money and policy review so budgets will be linked to activity and outputs. There will be a link between how money is spent and positive outcomes for people with disabilities and this is only right as taxpayers' money is being targeted on those who need it. There will be personalised, community-based services and this is important so people can live in their communities, access services and be looked after holistically. It is important that we devise strategies to deal with unemployment among disabled people and be ever-vigilant into the future on this issue. It is unquestionable that the level of unemployment is higher among disabled people. Even before the recruitment embargo, the quota system in the public service did not work properly as it tended only to absorb people within the public service who fell ill or developed a disability in the course of their work. The public service tended not to use the quota system to recruit new staff who were disabled and this must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523"> The community-based model of residential service is evolving but needs more attention as various NAMA developments have the potential to help build the 25,000 private and social housing units per year promised by 2020. Some of these units should be targeted at people with disabilities as community residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524"> There is currently a controversy around the loss of funding by advocacy groups for people with disabilities and I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and the Cabinet to revisit this matter. There must be ways of reinstating this income and I hope it will be an outcome of this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525"> Carers are very important and I believe there is potential in the scheme for carers that has not yet been exploited. We could make caring a more attractive option for people in other low-paid jobs. It is not possible to go into great detail in a short period but the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and his colleagues must examine ways to expand the carer's allowance. Means testing is generous but could be improved and everything possible should be done to entice people to switch from low-paid employment to caring, which is also a form of real employment. There is great potential in this. The roll-out of primary care is a commitment in the priorities for Government because it is vital for the entire population, particularly disabled people who wish to live in their own communities and have a full life therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526"> Improvements in the quota system when the embargo on public service recruitment is lifted must mean more targeted employment opportunities for disabled people. Employers must be offered incentives to take on disabled people and when general employment incentives are created there should be a mandatory element included for disabled people. If an employer is to benefit from tax relief for employing extra people a certain quota should be disabled. If we develop residential services and community living for people with disabilities they will live full lives because they will have access to everything they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527"> The carer's allowance must be more attractive and those currently in receipt could be offered more benefits. The income threshold should also be increased and, in so far as possible, the carer's allowance should be increased incrementally. This will make caring a more attractive career and a real option for people. This would give many people with severe disabilities a greatly enhanced quality of life and allow them to live where they want to live, in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">Thanks be to God in contemporary times we have made enormous progress from the traditional old-fashioned model of institutionalisation and all that went with it back in the dark days. Immense progress has been made but there is still a great need to do more and improve. Now that all the signs suggest we are emerging somewhat from recession, although we would not want to get carried away, it is important that we positively discriminate towards disabled people with the increased resources and greater flexibility in budgets, as they have borne the greatest brunt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529"> I repeat my request to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and the Cabinet that we revisit the issue of the advocacy groups and their income.</p>

          <p eId="para_1533">I know mental illness is not a disability and that disability is not mental illness, but there is an alignment in the area of stigma and I wish to deal with this aspect. Stigma can be deeply hurtful and isolating. It is one of the most significant problems encountered by people with mental health problems. At another time it was also there for those who suffer from disability, but thankfully this has moved on. What we now want to highlight is that it is so important that the stigma which surrounded disability 40 or 50 years ago, and which surrounds mental illness now, moves on. Learning to live with a mental health problem is made more difficult when someone experiences the prejudice caused by stigma around mental ill-health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534"> Stigma can be used to exclude and marginalise people. The prejudice and fear caused by stigma can even prevent people from coming forward and seeking the help they need, which is especially true about young people and particularly young males. Stigma can also stop people offering help to or being supportive of people who suffer from mental ill-health. This is especially the case within families, which are not prepared to accept they should seek help or to advise a member of the family to seek help if he or she has a crisis or a mental ill-health problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535"> Stigma often inhibits people from getting the jobs for which they are qualified and I will speak about this later because I have some statistics. It can prevent people with mental health problems from playing an active role in their communities. There is an economic cost to this because people who have a mental illness can contribute to our economy. There are also significant social and personal costs. People with mental health problems consistently identify stigma, discrimination and social exclusion as major barriers to their health, well-being and quality of life. Stigma can and does contribute to limiting access to housing and employment, damaging social relationships and social participation and reducing self-esteem in a big way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536"> When we speak about stigma we mean using negative labels to identify people with mental health problems. This used to be the case with regard to people with a disability, but thankfully this has moved on. Stigma has its roots in fear and misunderstanding. Many people hold negative opinions towards people with mental health problems because they do not understand the issues involved and they rely on myths and misconceptions. International research and policy documents identify stigma as one of the most persistent barriers to understanding mental health problems and the importance of mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537"> I wish to discuss some work and research done in this area in the time I have left. In September 2012, St. Patrick's Hospital conducted research on how the general public perceive people with mental health problems. We must bear in mind when people are asked the question about how they feel about mental health that they are likely to underestimate the level of stigma because they wish to be positive. A total of 20% believed those with mental health problems were below average intelligence. A total of 40% considered that seeking help for a mental health problem was a sign of personal failure. A total of 66% experienced reluctance to hire a person with a mental health problem, believing them to be unreliable. A total of 30% would not be willing to accept somebody with a mental health problem as a close friend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538"> In another study conducted by Amnesty International, which was conducted in September 2011, the organisation spoke to people who had suffered or were suffering a mental health problem to get their views. A total of 94% of those who suffered from a mental ill-health problem had experienced unfair treatment. A total of 70% concealed mental health problems, 50% stopped having a close relationship and 60% stopped working.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539"> We must tackle negative labels for people who suffer from an illness over which they have no control over, just as I had no control over the illness with which I suffered at a certain stage in my life. We identify people with mental health problems very negatively. How do we talk about people? We ask whether they are mad. We say they are idiots. We say they are mental health cases, barmy, light in the head or not the full shilling. These are the labels we put on people who suffer from an illness. We face a challenge to get over this labelling, just as we did with regard to those with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540"> I pay tribute to a Government organisation, See Change, and John Moloney, who established it when he was the Minister of State. It does much work in this area. People should look at its website and the work it does very quietly. It comes from such a low base given the negativity that it is a challenge. People will say we have not moved at all but I do not believe this. I have been working and campaigning in this area since 1990, when I was a Member of the Seanad and campaigned to decriminalise suicide, which we achieved in 1993. We have moved, but on a continuum from zero to ten we are at two or three. We have a long way to go in dealing with the issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_1541"> It is no reflection on any Minister, but one of the reasons we do not make the investment we should in mental health is that the electorate does not demand it of us. When one canvasses, one hears about physical health problems, waiting lists and elderly people waiting on trolleys. Do we ever hear about a child waiting for six months or 12 months for a psychiatric intervention or a psychiatric assessment?</p>
          <p eId="para_1542">We do not because of the stigma that prevents people talking about it. I am told about it because I am identified with the issue, but if we are not told about it, we do not demand our Government or our political system to do something about it. In other words the reason that mental health has not been dealt with over the decades is that there are no votes in it. We need to raise the issue as a political one. I raised this when I was first elected to the Dáil many years ago and it was the first ever debate on a Private Members' motion on suicide. It has been debated quite often since then, but not as regularly as most health issues. We should bear in mind that one in four people at some stage in their lives will suffer from a mental health problem. It is an issue that should have more political attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1543"> I am using this opportunity to make comparisons with how people with disabilities were discriminated against in the past, including people in wheelchairs. There is still a certain level of stigma, but it is very minor. While we might talk down to somebody in a wheelchair, it has moved on in most areas of disability. It is moving on from the area of intellectual disability. We now understand intellectual disability differently from some years ago. There are two very good books in the Library here on the history of mental health in Ireland one of which goes back to the-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1548">I take the opportunity to congratulate formally the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and I wish him well in his new role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549"> I thank those who tabled the motion for discussion. It is quite appropriate that the voice of the disabled - there are many - is heard in this House. That is why I welcome discussion of this nature irrespective of the side of the House it comes from. None of us has a monopoly of care or love regarding those against whom nature has discriminated. It would be an error on our part and it would be to our shame that this Parliament would not come back to the subject on as many occasions as it possibly can in order that not only can we defend the gains that have been made for people who are disabled - I do not like the word - but in better financial circumstances the quality of life is extended and made better for people who fall into that category of being disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550"> I want to avoid going back over territory that was dealt with earlier in the debate. All of us, irrespective of the constituency we are in, have to pay tribute not only to the people who work full time for remuneration but also to those who volunteer and participate with disability groups and give their time freely, in some cases, as was acknowledged yesterday, a considerable amount of their time. These include people who do not have immediate family members who, unfortunately, have a disability of some nature. These are people who just volunteer. This is one of the great things that shows the decency of Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551"> I know that one cannot get away from the media thing. Sometimes one has to reflect on the light that has been shone on Irish society in the past and maybe somewhat on the present. We have the report published today on those young people. If we go back a few weeks, there is another report and another report. One sometimes gets disillusioned and asks what sort of society and State operated given the scandals over how we treated our children, mothers and babies, child abuse, and clerical child abuse. At the time we had the debate in the House about clerical sexual abuse, I heard a woman on the radio say she was ashamed about her nationality with all this stuff coming out. It is frightening and embarrassing for a generation of people, but it is good that the whole thing is opened up and out there, irrespective of how we might feel about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552"> I know the church takes a bit of stick, and rightly so. I have not been behind the door in giving it some stick over its control and monopoly of Irish society for too long. Those politicians who went before us were not the bravest either and they turned a blind eye to what happened. It is not simply a matter of punching at the church and pointing out what it did wrong. People like to use the word "State". I prefer to use the word "politicians" because - let us cut out the nonsense - they looked the other way unfortunately and that is where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553"> There has been no monopoly in terms of predecessors to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in terms of trying to protect the funding. Fair play to Deputy Neville for referring to the former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney. If someone in another party takes a positive and useful initiative, it deserves to be acknowledged, and that is a good thing. In difficult times it is very important to protect what funding is there for people who, unfortunately, fall into this category. In better times as things improve, discussions should take place in this House to give a better quality of life to those against whom nature has discriminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1554"> I remember going, as many Irish emigrants did, to Hyde Park in London. There were many Irish accents there and it was a great place to turn up for someone interested in current affairs and politics. I remember an advocate, a volunteer, with a very strong Scottish accent getting on the platform. He used to turn up every Saturday. He always concluded his contribution by saying: "We are all disabled; it is just that some are more disabled." That is the reality of it. Some are more disabled. It is for those who are elected to this House on all sides to work for a better quality of living for the people who fall into this category.</p>

          <p eId="para_1557">I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for submitting this Private Members' motion and for being a consistent champion on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, well in his new job. It is an important job and I have no doubt but he will make the very best effort in it. However, Members should not underestimate the challenges the country faces and the situation in which it finds itself. Members in this Dáil have debated and argued at length about the impact of austerity on all sorts of vulnerable sectors of society that really have been affected, often cruelly, by the economic crash and the austerity that has been imposed - I will not state we had to impose it. Many sectors have suffered but there is no doubt but that those with a disability, those with special needs, those with mental health issues and so on have suffered disproportionately as a result of the austerity programme. Every indicator shows that those with disabilities are affected worst by all these cuts regardless of whether they are imposed in respect of social welfare, education or health. They hurt a lot of people in all sorts of areas but they hurt people with disabilities more. Moreover, all facts and statistics make clear that people with disabilities are more likely to be poor and are becoming even more likely to be poor than other sectors of society. They are twice as likely, if not more, to suffer from or to be at risk of poverty, are more likely to be unemployed and are less likely to get into third level education. That is discrimination and when Members talk about women being likely to be paid less or being less well represented in particular areas of society, they call it what they should, namely, oppression and discrimination, and state that something must be done about it. However, this is precisely what people with disabilities suffer. They suffer oppression and discrimination and the facts bear out this. Consequently, imposing cuts in these areas is a cruel worsening of the position of a sector of society that already is severely disadvantaged and discriminated against.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559"> At the most basic level, I think of those who attend my constituency clinic seeking stair lifts, walk-in showers or grab rails. They have suffered strokes and are physically disabled in some way or other but when they approach the local council to inform it that they need such items immediately, they are told they cannot have them for a year, because the budget has run out, as it has been cut. This simply is unacceptable. It is bad enough for people without disabilities who must try to access public services that are being cut but for those with disabilities, it is even worse. The subject of mental health was mentioned previously and something that is not being discussed enough is the fact there are no inpatient beds for young children with mental health issues. Therefore, they have been turned away when they have serious problems, sometimes when suicidal, or are being put into adult institutions, which are completely inappropriate for them. This is a breach of their human rights, is highly dangerous and is happening because of cuts that are being imposed in the area of health. Housing costs disproportionately affect the disabled and then of course there are cuts to the advocacy groups. Given that there is discrimination, disadvantage and so on for people with disability, the idea that the Government would take €1.2 million from those groups which advocate on their behalf is absolutely unacceptable and should be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560"> Consequently, it is vitally important that this Private Members' motion is accepted, that those cuts are reversed, that the Government places an absolute special priority on ensuring the discriminatory and unfair position that affects people with disabilities will be remedied urgently and that there will be absolutely no further cuts affecting those with disability in the forthcoming budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_1562">I join with my colleagues in congratulating Deputy Finian McGrath for once again bringing a serious problem, which gets neglected so often, to Members' attention. It is a problem that gets camouflaged by the kind of lip-service that often comes from Governments in situations where they are not prepared to do as much about something as they aspire to or have promised to do. I agree with all those who state quite simply that cuts to disability funding are unacceptable. It seems strange - I will not repeat the examples frequently quoted in this Chamber - that there could be expenditure on matters of some frivolity, while cutting back on those who are the most vulnerable in Ireland. This has been a consistent trend on the part of several Governments since the recession hit the country. While people have been prepared to line the pockets of their friends in lots of ways that are unacceptable, it is perceived that the disabled still are fair game for cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563"> I accept there is genuine consensus on all sides of this House that more should be done for the disabled. That is apparent in particular in the motion tabled by Deputy Finian McGrath but also in the words spoken by Members from all sides this evening. It also is apparent in the Government amendment. However, I cannot understand why the Government considered it necessary to amend this motion, which is moderate in its requirements, reasonable in its demands and I would have thought acceptable to any reasonable person, particularly in government, as well as being pretty cost-free. However, the Government responded by tabling a long-winded amendment in which it congratulated itself on a great many things it claims it has done. Moreover, in what to me are weasel words, it also refuses to take action in key areas. I will cite a couple of lines from it. It states it "recognises the central role which work plays in the lives of people with disabilities and is committed to the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities". That means absolutely nothing as being committed to a comprehensive - a long, fairly meaningless word - employment strategy for people with disabilities means there is no action. It goes on to state the strategy "will be published this year, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014". Publication is not action; publication is delay. Publication is something for which one waits and then decides on whether one will act or will then consult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564"> The point that I consider to be such a pity in this regard is that whereas there are genuine commitments to this, Members saw this particular commitment tested not long ago in an equally commendable Bill that was introduced by Deputy Finian McGrath and which was accepted by the Government in this Chamber on Second Stage. It now has been parked, presumably forever. It is no good to express one's agreement with a Bill only to park it somewhere, not bring it forward, not give time for it and not take action on it. That is cynical and is exploitation of the disabled. This motion recognises in a mature, sophisticated and absolutely necessary way that it is not good enough simply to give sympathy and funding. One must recognise that it is not adequate to recognise people's disabilities with funding alone but one must also state these are citizens, whose disabilities deprive them of employment and of care, as well as giving them a lesser chance in education and, consequently, they must be compensated for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565"> Finally, I wish to note there was a really serious crisis in Rehab and the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, where disabled people were not just neglected but were exploited.</p>

There has been a slowing down. It should be recognised that those who suffered from the actions of the exploiters were disabled people. The Government should address the lack of any tangible recognition of this by removing the obstacles to compelling those who have questions to answer to appear before Oireachtas committees. </p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1569">I congratulate Deputy Finian McGrath on raising again the important issue of disabled people. The Deputy has consistently championed people with disabilities over the years, for which I thank him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570"> I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, on his elevation to office and hope things go well for him. The first item of business for the new Minister of State is to personally intervene to reverse cuts in funding for advocacy organisations. These cuts, which amount to €1.2 million and affect 26 advocacy organisations that support and advocate on behalf of people with disabilities, are unacceptable. Last evening, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, informed the House she was unaware of the cuts and had not been consulted on them. I ask the Minister of State to personally intervene to have them withdrawn. </p>
          <p eId="para_1571"> Caring for a child or family member with disabilities is a major challenge, which has been made significantly more difficult by the austerity agenda pursued in recent years. Parents and carers face serious mental, physical and financial challenges and are under constant pressure as they fight to have their needs and entitlements met. As children with disabilities grow older, their parents and carers worry about what will happen to them when they are no longer around to look after them. As a result of the austerity measures implemented in recent years, 45% of people with disabilities endure income poverty and 36% experience deprivation, more than 50% of those living in jobless households are either children or adults with disabilities and those who are out of work through illness or disability endure the highest levels of poverty, approximately twice the national average. In those circumstances, it is vital that the cuts in funding and services are reversed. The number of day care, residential and respite places must not be reduced further. On the contrary, the number of places provided for people with disabilities must be increased. </p>
          <p eId="para_1572"> I was contacted during the week about a case, which may appear minor to healthy individuals, where the principal carer of a child with disabilities became unwell. Notwithstanding the best efforts of grandparents, aunts, uncles and siblings, if a carer is ill for any length of time, it creates a major problem. Particular attention should be paid to these types of cases, even if only during the summer months when most children attend summer camps. Perhaps places in such camps could be made available for children with disabilities. The individual who contacted me is very worried and believes the matter could be resolved by the provision of respite care or a place in summer camps. </p>
          <p eId="para_1573"> Carers do a vast amount of work, the value of which to the State is estimated to be €4 billion per annum or one third of the budget of the Health Service Executive. Recent cuts to carers' payments must be reversed in the forthcoming budget. The half-rate carer's allowance must become a core payment. Cuts to the respite care grant must be restored to its previous level and the household benefits package for carers and people with disabilities must be reversed because these benefits are essential to the livelihoods of people with disabilities. I commend the motion. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_679">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1574">I too wish the Minister of State well in his new challenge and hope he makes a positive impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575"> While Deputy Finian McGrath's motion may be a statement of the obvious, the points therein need to be continually made in an effort to obtain fairness for some of the people who most need it. I will raise a number of issues, the first of which is the matter of respite care. Budget 2013 imposed a 19% cut to the respite care grant, which was significantly higher than other cuts made to the Department of Social Protection budget. In addition, respite care facilities have been closed without any replacements being put in place, which is putting families under serious pressure and stress. I support the call made by the Carers Association for the restoration of the respite care grant to €1,700 in budget 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576"> The Carers Association has also drawn attention to the challenges faced by those caring for adults with intellectual or mental health illness when applying for carer's allowance, carer's benefit or the respite care grant. According to the Carers Association, these people find that the forms and application process "weigh significantly in favour of those with a physical disability, while carers for those with an intellectual disability or mental health issue are forced to supply additional medical evidence". This is burdensome for carers and puts pressure on other people to write exhaustive reports, thus impacting on service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577"> Those who have managed to get through the application process and are trying to appeal Department decisions about their eligibility for the carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance or disability allowance are faced with significant delays in the processing of appeals. Many applications for these payments are being considered by internal medical assessors who do not meet the families involved. In this regard, I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to outline her plans to address the recent High Court finding in the case of B <i>v</i>. Minister for Social Protection. The court found that deciding officers in the Department abdicated their decision-making duties unlawfully by "slavishly following" the opinions of their internal medical assessors. All the deciding officers who were so heavily criticised remain in their posts and there has been no confirmation from the Minister that this policy has been set aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578"> We know that at the end of March, more than 3,000 children and young people were waiting to be referred to mental health practitioners. This represents an 11% increase on the same period last year. It is disappointing that the new Child and Family Agency does not have the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, under its remit. This is a missed opportunity to have proper mental health services available to children in care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579"> Today, the Child and Family Agency published four reports into the deaths of young people in care, one of which identified critical gaps in mental health services. The relevant report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1580">This case highlighted a critical gap in psychiatric service provision for 16/17 year olds at this time, and the consequences of reliance on adult service for complex adolescents. It is now understood that many CAMHS services will work with young people up to the age of 18 years. However, services for this age range are still far from comprehensive, particularly when hospitalisation may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581">What is the Government doing to address this issue? According to a recent report by the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services, a total of 83 children were admitted to adult psychiatric units in 2013. The report notes that although this number has decreased since 2009, "A Vision for Change (2006) recommended that mental health inpatient services for children up to the age of 18 years be provided by dedicated child and adolescent inpatient units". According to the Mental Health Commission's code of practice relating to admission of children, no admission of a child under the age of 18 years to adult units was to take place after December 2011. Given that this deadline elapsed two and a half years ago, why is this practice continuing?</p>
          <p eId="para_1582"> I take the opportunity presented by this week's UN Human Rights Committee hearings to remind the Government that Ireland has still not ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583">The Inclusion Ireland organisation was in Geneva to attend the UN hearings. They expressed serious concern that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 will not be compliant with article 12 of the convention. These concerns were echoed by the UN committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_1584"> Given that the State likes to think of itself as a bastion of human rights, ratifying the convention would be a concrete step in demonstrating this commitment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1585">I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his new brief which is a challenge. He will be judged on it. Deputy Ó Cuív made a good point last night when he said the Government backbenchers are fond of blaming Fianna Fáil for decisions they took while in office. The Minister of State is in office now and if he does not agree with what they did, he is in a position to change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586"> It is an uphill struggle for people with disabilities and their families to access facilities and services so they can participate fully in society to the best of their potential. That struggle has not been made easier in the lifetime of the current Government. In fact, it has been made more difficult as conditions have deteriorated, so those with disabilities must engage in an almighty battle even for the basics. We could be here all night listing the problems, which include waiting lists for vital speech and language services, occupational therapy and physical therapy. There are long waiting lists but such services are often not available in some parts of Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_1587"> The freeze on public sector recruitment and the non-replacement of staff on maternity leave mean that families are being left with nothing. There is also a crisis in the mental health sector. The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is not fit for purpose and should be subject to an immediate review of its facilities and staffing levels. </p>
          <p eId="para_1588"> Deputy Wallace mentioned the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill and the fact that Ireland has not signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. All of these matters are hugely important but the treatment of children with disabilities is particularly abhorrent. The Government has fallen down in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589"> A family sent me a letter a while ago and began by quoting from the autism task-force of about 15 years ago. That report said the implications are clear - this is a vulnerable, high risk group in urgent need of help. In fact, they are more disabled in many ways by the attitudes of society, the neglect of State services and lack of support, than they are by their core disability. That is the point. We could be implementing measures that transform the lives of people with disabilities, but we are not. </p>
          <p eId="para_1590"> That starts with the education process in schools. There have been enormously detrimental changes at school level, including the SNA circular which has changed the whole criteria. If students are lucky they may get access to four hours of special needs assistance per week. Professional reports, however, are not being taken into account by the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, and there are many other instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591"> The people who wrote to me said they had listened to the previous Minister for Education and Skills telling us that the disability budget is the same as that for An Garda Síochána. They said they need a truly independent, statutory inspection and a root and branch review, exactly like what is being undertaken in An Garda Síochána, to deal with best international practice for children. We have really failed in this respect, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592"> The treatment of the deaf community could be sorted out easily. Deaf people are being marginalised and excluded when they should not be. This group of citizens has significantly lower employment expectations due to some of the measures in place. The cutting of the Deaforward Advocacy Service is scandalous and does not take into account deaf people's real lives. Some people think it is a matter of bringing in sign language because they can read, but that is not enough. Some 80% of deaf adults have a literacy level akin to an eight or nine year old. They cannot read or write to the same level and are thus excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593"> Things that would be simple for other people are not available for the deaf. They cannot ring someone up to get support and information, so they need advocacy services. The Irish Deaf Society's YouTube clip highlights all the areas of need. They may require private medical treatment, for example, and in addition deaf parents do not want their children reading out private correspondence on personal health matters. They need a third party to do that work. Those people's first language is Irish sign language, which they want to have recognised. It should be recognised and it is deeply regrettable that it has not been. It is insulting that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, put off that decision. She said we need to have the services in place before we can recognise Irish sign language.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594"> For a saving of €70,000 that advocacy service, which transforms the lives of deaf people, was axed. If the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Riordáin, does nothing else, he should reverse that cut. He will be judged on such actions and will benefit from them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1595">I compliment Deputy Finian McGrath and thank him for allowing me to speak on his motion. I salute him for his continuous work for those with disabilities. I welcome Mr. John Dolan and others from the Disability Federation of Ireland who are in the Public Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596"> The motion is simple and straightforward, unlike the Government's amendment which contains language that means nothing to people with disabilities. Why could the Government not have just accepted this motion? </p>
          <p eId="para_1597"> I wish the new Minister of State well, but the Taoiseach missed an opportunity yesterday to demonstrate full interest in and caring for people with disabilities by not appointing a senior Minister to that role. Such an appointment could look after those people. As Deputy Neville said, we are all disabled in many ways, some more than others. I salute Deputy Neville and others who support this motion but who unfortunately, because of the Whip system, will have to troop in behind the Government to vote it down. </p>
          <p eId="para_1598"> The Government amendment is full of self-congratulatory statements, which are empty and valueless. In the last budget, we saw the attacks, including cuts, on people with disabilities. If evidence is needed it is to be found in this Government's record. As Deputy Ó Cuív said, Government backbenchers keep blaming the last Government, but they have been in government for almost three and a half years now. Apart from the annual budgets, there have been three or four savage attacks on people with disabilities. They had to come up here to protest last summer and threatened to sit outside Leinster House all night. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said he knew nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1599"> Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said she did not know anything about last week's 25 cuts to the advocacy groups by Pobal. What is going on? Are the lunatics running the asylum? They cannot claim they do not know. They are elected by the people to govern, so they must do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600"> There is a sustained attack by some sections in Government - I am not saying politicians, but by the permanent government - to cut and row back on payments for those with disabilities. It is shameful. They should not have to come here and fight to be looked after. We will be judged on how we look after ourselves. </p>
          <p eId="para_1601"> The cuts to advocacy groups are appalling and to think that Pobal is administering this. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said last night that she did not know anything about it. The former Minister, Deputy Hogan, who was in charge of Pobal, has now left these lands for greener pastures. No one cares. Pobal is the same organisation that administers child care and grant aid for many other sectors. It is another quango which, like the HSE, was set up as an intermediary body that we can blame. </p>
          <p eId="para_1602"> Last week, we saw where an independent report would not sign off on the €2.5 million spent by Pobal going around to inspect areas involved in an early child care study. Pobal was inspecting the matter while it is also administering it, so the fox is minding the chickens. It is farcical and it had better change. As long as that situation continues, the Minister of State will have no hope of changing anything. It is easy to blame Pobal which is an independent organisation, but it is not the same as voluntary organisations, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association and countless others, whose members are out day and night looking after people with disabilities. They have busy lives but devote their spare time to raising funds through church gate collections, organising golf classics and bringing those on respite grants away for holidays. They do all this in a voluntary capacity. Then we can see what went on at the Central Remedial Clinic, which was disgraceful. </p>
          <p eId="para_1603"> It is time the Government intervened and took charge of this sector. It should take charge of running the country because it is not only this area that is out of kilter and out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604">Pobal is administering the scheme and it is also supposed to monitor it, for which it is claiming considerable amounts of money. It is claiming €2.5 million when €1.2 million would keep 25 organisations, such as the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland, in operation. Money is being cut for people with the most debilitating diseases, €25,000 in some cases. It is merciless and disgraceful for Government Members to rub their hands and blame Pobal. The Taoiseach stated yesterday and today that it is possible to appeal decisions. These appeals get us nowhere. Where is the humanity in Government and State institutions like the HSE or the many quangos that have been established despite the Government's promise to abandon them? If the Taoiseach was sincere about this issue, he would appoint a full Minister with responsibility for disabilities. Given the mess of the health services, we cannot rely on the HSE to look after this area. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to rein in Pobal and recoup this money. If his predecessor does not know, I ask him to find out why these cuts were imposed. Will people have to wait four months for a decision on an appeal even though staff are depending on the funding? Shame on this Government for attacking the poorest of the poor.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_682">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1605">I thank Deputies for their kind remarks on my appointment. I welcome the opportunity to speak on disability services and to outline the extent of this Government's commitment to people with disabilities. I commend my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her single minded commitment to achieving a better and fairer outcome for people with disabilities. This goal is also relevant to me in my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for equality. My objective until the end of this Government's term is to set out the equality agenda not only as a societal need, but also as an economic need. As has been noted on all sides of the House this evening, countries that are more equal do better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606"> There was a perception in the past in this country and most other jurisdictions that people with disabilities should adapt themselves to society. It is important to restate what the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said last Tuesday, namely, people with disabilities are not ill and do not need to be fixed. Thankfully, there is now recognition that society needs to change. People with disabilities must be supported as full and equal citizens of this country who participate in Irish society on the same basis as any other citizen. This principle is at the heart of the Government's approach to issues affecting those with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607"> As Deputy Maloney correctly pointed out, no side of this House has a monopoly of wisdom in this regard. Tremendous work has already been done to improve supports for families, provide early intervention services, streamline access to therapy services for children and provide dedicated resources for children with special education needs, an area close to my own heart. Ten years ago the special education budget amounted to approximately €450 million. At the height of the boom in 2009 it was €750 million. Now it is approximately €1.3 billion, or 15% of the entire education budget. At the end of this year, nearly 11,000 special needs assistants will be working in the Irish education system, which is more than ever, and the number of special classes has increased by 60% since the 2010-11 academic year. We still face challenges, however. For example, in the context of an increase of 2% in the student intake last year, the number of students with special educational needs increased by 11%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608"> As students progress to adulthood, disability services are being transformed. We are moving towards the delivery of a person centred model of support whereby people with disabilities are no longer the passive recipients of an often segregated service but instead have more control over their own lives. We are also rationalising administrative processes to make services more effective, efficient and responsive. One example is the success achieved this year in the provision of life skills training and day supports for school leavers with disabilities. The Government's commitment to implementing a comprehensive employment strategy will be a vital aspect of the whole of government approach to disability issues. The inclusion of the strategy in the Action Plan for Jobs and the subsequent monitoring through the Cabinet committee of Pathways to Work reinforces the principle of mainstreaming. This is a central tenet of the national disability strategy and it means that issues which affect people with disability should be addressed by the public bodies which have responsibility for these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609"> Deputies Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, Michael Wallace and Clare Daly referred to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is a priority for me. I understand that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, which is awaiting Committee Stage, will deal with most of the issues that hinder ratification. Further legislation will be needed to deal with other issues, such as reasonable accommodation, but most of what needs to be done has already been scoped out. I expect to bring proposals to Government on further necessary legislation in the next six months. The necessary consultation with relevant Departments is under way and should be finalised shortly. </p>
          <p eId="para_1610"> Speakers on all sides of the House raised the issue of funding for advocacy groups. I will take on board the comments made and commit to the House that I will discuss the matters raised with the Minister of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. Services are provided to people with disabilities across many areas of government. New developments in housing and employment activation show that the Government is pushing out the boundaries to enable people with disabilities to participate more fully in society. Funding provided to programmes outside the health budget, in addition to the HSE's annual expenditure of €1.4 billion, enables people with disabilities to avail of an extensive range of financial supports and services. The challenge for all of us will be to ensure this funding is used to best effect to facilitate full participation in society by people with disabilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1611">I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well. Last week, international media, particularly in the United States, watched in bewilderment as the possibility emerged of emergency legislation being drafted in this country to allow five Garth Brooks concerts to proceed in Croke Park. The singer was apparently up in arms that 400,000 ticket holders are going to be let down but he refused to discriminate against 160,000 of those fans by holding three concerts. The number of disabled people in this country who are being let down and discriminated against on an all too regular basis stands at almost 600,000, enough to fill Croke Park seven times over. While some of this discrimination is beyond the Government's control, a huge amount of it is actually its own doing. The recent withdrawal of almost €1.2 million in funding from 25 disability and care focused groups has been widely acknowledged as decimating the sector. Core services and supports have been consistently hacked away by the current administration. Many families living with disability tell me that dignity and independence is a thing of the past and that they are struggling to get by on a day-to-day basis. Support organisations such as Chronic Pain Ireland report that they can barely last until the end of the year unless the cuts are reversed. It is a terrible indictment that such organisations might go to the wall. It is unthinkable that we would allow services like Chronic Pain Ireland to be destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612"> The impact of these cuts is not felt in isolation. They have a huge knock-on effect on the family of the person with a disability. I refer not only to the grotesque cuts to services, but also the devastating and disproportionate impact that sweeping taxes and charges are having on the disabled, a case in point being the upcoming water charges. In recent days I was approached by a family who expressed serious concern about how the water needs of their two disabled children will be calculated as part of the families' overall water bill. These children, like many people with disabilities, have greater sanitation and laundry requirements. This family is one of the hundreds of cases Deputies are encountering. People do not know what to do as yet another horrendous burden is placed on people with disabilities and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1613">The 2011 census painted a stark picture of the place in our society in which many disabled people are just existing. For example, among disabled people aged 15 to 49, one in six has completed no higher than primary level education, with one quarter of disabled people getting as far as second level education. Naturally, this disadvantage extends into the workplace, as people with a disability are less than half as likely to be active in the labour market and are more likely to experience workplace discrimination, according the Equality Authority. Research by that organisation indicates only 36% of people with a disability are active in the labour force. Ireland's employment rate of people with disabilities is notably lower than the European average, despite the issue being brought to the attention of successive Governments. The danger is a reinforcement of a perception that people with disabilities are a burden on the State, although in my experience, the opposite is true. Most disabled people I have met strive for independence and equality and want nothing more than to make a meaningful contribution to society. They need to be supported in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1614"> As my colleagues noted earlier, the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva discussed some serious breaches of human rights in our society. We speak of this time after time but we still have not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The commitments contained in that document have often been made by Irish politicians and all too easily they are neglected. Deputy Finian McGrath's motion would go a significant way towards promoting, protecting and strengthening the human rights of all persons with disabilities in this country. I, along with many others present, have read the motion. Support groups and many people throughout the country have indicated it is a reasonably worded motion and Deputy Finian McGrath has put much effort and thought into it. He has had a barrister examine it, for example. I urge the Members opposite, even at this late stage, to support it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_684">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1615">I have heard a few people talk about "disability" in this debate and say they may find it embarrassing to say the word. I do not accept that. A disability is only a disability when barriers are put up and it is up to society to take away those obstacles. For example, if a dyslexic person cannot read in a class, there would be immediate intervention and recognition that this may be a problem for a person. The child in question would be assessed and brought into educational surroundings he or she requires. I know many dyslexic children who went to a particular school to develop their education before going on to be accountants, for example, and play a key role in society. This is where our society has let down people and the austerity process has put up barriers again. Rather than seeing those barriers coming down, people with disabilities are seeing them going up. The Irish Deaf Society had confidence to demand that Irish Sign Language be recognised, but its funding has been pulled and its offices have closed. It is another brick in the wall for those people to surmount in achieving dignity and accessibility in order that they can play a role in society at a much higher level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616"> The Government amendment to Deputy Finian McGrath's motion is a disgrace and does not recognise such efforts. The Government's record in disability services and support is a complete contradiction of the Government's stated objectives. The amendment repeats the lofty aspirations of the national disability strategy and includes a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities to be published this year as part of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. That is a very slow process and it does not approach the mark of addressing those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617"> The Government has constantly chipped away at specific disability supports, along with mainstream supports. Some 45% of people with disabilities experience income poverty, which means there is something fundamentally wrong. This is not about statistics but real people. The list of cuts is outrageous and every year there is a cut in HSE funding for disability services. There have also been cuts in the housing adaptation grant and capping of special needs assistants. The Minister of State has said that more money will be put into this because there are 2% more children in the education system but that number could decrease by 2% in five years. We must adapt in being able to resource these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1618"> People feel their children are not being supported within mainstream school. We have spoken about the argument of mainstreaming people so people will not be seen as having a disability, as the Travellers are not treated as a section of society requiring needs. If we do not have proper structures in place to support people, we will be putting barriers up against some in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619"> Among the cuts is a decrease in mobility and motorised transport allowances. The motor fuel payment used to be quarterly to disabled drivers but it is now paid once a year, making it more difficult for people to be able to manage their income over 12 months. That was a major blow for people when it was implemented in a Finance Bill. The number of personal assistants has been cut and there is a severe decrease in the number of house support hours and the respite care grant. There have also been cuts to the household benefits package and an increase in prescription charges, which have particularly affected those who are disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1620"> Despite promises, there have been cuts in basic social welfare payments such as disability allowance, the blind pension, invalidity and carer's allowance. The latest revoking of funding for a scheme for the 26 disability organisations is an absolute scandal. It was shocking to hear the Minister of State say yesterday she did not know about this, and we should ask why that was so. She has been responsible for equality and disability matters. I have more to say but I will finish on that point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_685">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-07-16T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1621">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this very important motion. I wish the new Minister of State well and congratulate him on his new portfolio. I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this very important two-day debate on disability matters. It is important to keep this issue on the political agenda and we have a long way to go to ensure all our citizens can be treated equally with respect and dignity. I thank my colleagues in the Technical Group for their great support, dedication and commitment on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622"> We either believe in equality or we do not. We either support inclusion or we do not. There can be no buts or ifs with this matter. In responding to the Government, we must focus on a number of key priorities, as some must be dealt with tonight, tomorrow or the immediate days afterwards. Many of my colleagues raised the issue of €1.2 million in funding which has been lost to the 26 disability organisations before the commencement of the summer recess in the Oireachtas this week. There were 26 bodies which saw their funding through a scheme to support national organisations, run by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, revoked on 30 June. As we heard last night, the Minister of State with responsibility for the implementation of the national disability strategy, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, confirmed she had not been advised on this development. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623"> I was interested to hear the Minister of State speak about equality and full and equal rights. This is a smokescreen, as the Government is in charge. It should stop cutting services to people with a disability. The Minister of State has said we can discuss these matters tomorrow but that is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624">If the Minister of State believes in inclusion he will stop these cuts tomorrow. Listening to some of the speakers on the Government side last night one would think everything was hunky-dory in the disability sector. Some of their contributions astounded me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625"> To put it in context, I received a letter this morning from a person with a disability. He thanked us for the motion but said that the budget cuts to the disability sector which this Government has enforced since 2011 have effectively set the sector back 100 years. He said lives are on the edge when a person with a serious debilitating illness can get only one hour of personal assistant help a week. That says a lot about this Government. There are many other such letters too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626"> We need to focus on the real issues for people with a disability. There was an average cut of 4.1% in disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer's allowance in 2011. There was a 19% cut to the respite care grant in 2013. There have been changes in eligibility for a community child care subvention scheme. There is a growing waiting list for personal assistant hours while 1,308 of our citizens need personal assistant hours. This is the real world. There are 27,256 people with intellectual disabilities. There are 197 people who need a day service now. That is a small figure that could be dealt with in one simple budgetary measure. There are also 2,271 people looking for residential services. There are 2,054 who need residential support services for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627"> I call on the Minister of State and the Government to ensure that all people with a disability are guaranteed a service as a right. I demand an end to cuts to front-line services. I also request the appointment of a senior Minister with dedicated responsibility for disability inclusion. We need to prioritise funding of disability services and pursue the implementation of agreed measures, targets and timelines. In 2011, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste spoke on "Prime Time" before the election and promised that disability was their priority issue. I call on the Government to implement that plan, stop the waffle and talk, and support people with disabilities. They are have rights. They are our citizens and I urge all Deputies from all parties to support this motion. </p>

            <p eId="para_7249">Action 7.3.1 of the Health Reform Programme is that the Department of Health will work with the HSE and the State Claims Agency to develop a risk based approach to provision of indemnity to services and professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_7250"> The State underwrites indemnity for all public services and the professionals who provide them. In effect, this means that the State carries the risk of services which may not be safe or which do not align with national policy goals. This system of enterprise liability is managed through the Clinical Indemnity Scheme. My Department is working with the HSE and the State Claims Agency (which operates the Clinical Indemnity Scheme) to ensure that the indemnity provided to services aligns with health systems policy. The Patient Safety Agency has not yet been established, but this does not hamper the development of the risk-based approach to the provision of indemnity. </p>
            <p eId="para_7251"> The first stage in this process is the development and operation of a new upgraded database system, developed by the State Claims Agency, which will capture information on adverse events. The National Adverse Event Management System (NAEMS) went live in 119 State authorities under the remit of the State Claims Agency on 16 June, 2014 and since that date all incidents from the HSE are held on the new upgraded system. The system is being rolled out initially over the coming months, with training being provided to its users. </p>
            <p eId="para_7252"> Agreement will be reached by the end of 2014 between the State Claims Agency, the HSE's Patient Safety Directorate and my Department on the criteria for enabling this system to provide end to end adverse event management, root cause analysis and policy audit tools. This will, in turn, allow for the development of performance benchmarks on clinical and non-clinical risks and claims performance, which will underpin a risk pooling approach to the Clinical Indemnity Scheme. </p>

            <p eId="para_7256">Successful transformation of our health services requires a corresponding transformation of the existing funding model. The first stage in transforming this funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets. In Vote terms, programme based budgets have already been established for the Primary Care Reimbursement Service and NHSS - Fair Deal. During 2013, due to the imminent establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the determination of a Children and Family Services budget took primacy, given the need to transfer the provision from the Vote of the Health Service Executive to the Vote of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7257"> My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop a new Programme Based Budgeting system. However, given the multitude of financial systems in operation in the HSE, this work will be dependant on the development and roll out of an integrated financial management system. A detailed business case for a new finance operating model, including the procurement of a new Integrated Financial Management System for the wider health service, has been submitted to my Department. The business case is under consideration within my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>

The reason for allowing this period to elapse was to ensure that the Scheme had bedded in and that established trends would be available in order to inform the work of the Review. The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_7262"> One of the Terms of Reference for the Review is to consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health). The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time. This exercise is broader than was first envisaged and the various issues arising are now being systematically considered with a view to completion and publication as early as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_7264">In line with recommendations contained in Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015, the HSE is currently working on a Prospective Funding Model for Palliative Care which will assist in integrating and accounting for palliative care across all funding streams and delivery models. </p>
            <p eId="para_7265"> An Expert Group on Prospective Funding in Palliative Care was established in May 2012 to produce a report with recommendations about the development of this Prospective Funding Model for the consideration of the HSE and the Department of Health. The Group is chaired by Professor Charles Normand, Professor of Health Policy and Management, Trinity College Dublin, and includes a representative of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7266"> It is expected that an interim report will be submitted to the Department of Health in Q3 2014 which will include:</p>
            <p eId="para_7267"> - a review of international approaches to palliative care funding;</p>

            <p eId="para_7273">The National Ambulance Service is continuing to modernise and reconfigure its services, to ensure that emergency pre-hospital care is delivered in an appropriate and timely manner. A significant reform programme is currently underway which will provide a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology. In that regard, additional funding of €3.6 million and 43 staff have been provided in the National Service Plan 2014. Ongoing performance improvement projects include; </p>
            <p eId="para_7274"> - completion of the single national control system, due in 2015;</p>
            <p eId="para_7275"> - the introduction of the Intermediate Care Service, for routine and non-emergency transfers, allowing emergency vehicles to focus on emergency situations;</p>
            <p eId="para_7276"> - the move to on-duty rostering and the development of a national rostering system. </p>
            <p eId="para_7277"> Work is ongoing on all of these projects. For details of time frames of each element of the programme, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the HSE direct reply to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_7283"> Concerning ambulance capacity in any given area, the Deputy will be aware that there are currently three separate reviews taking place into the provision of pre-hospital emergency care nationally. These reviews will cover all aspects of the service, from governance to the level of resources needed to deliver a safe and effective service now and into the future. I am confident that these reviews will inform the development of a modern, clinically driven system, properly resourced, for appropriate and timely services to the benefit of patients.</p>
