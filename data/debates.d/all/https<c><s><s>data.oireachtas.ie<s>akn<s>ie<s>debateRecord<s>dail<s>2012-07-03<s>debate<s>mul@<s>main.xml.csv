#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	0	In an announcement to the Irish Stock Exchange on 19 June, the board of Ryanair announced its intention to make an all-cash offer for 100% of the share capital of Aer Lingus.  Under the takeover panel rules, Ryanair must issue its formal offer document to Aer Lingus shareholders by 17 July, setting out in detail the terms of its offer.  As the Government is a minority shareholder in Aer Lingus, under Irish takeover panel rules, there are restrictions on what any member of the Government can say about the proposed offer at this time.  For the moment, like all shareholders, the Government will await the formal offer from Ryanair and also the response of the board of Aer Lingus.  The European Commission will also have to consider the proposal when it receives formal notification of the offer from Ryanair.In considering the formal offer, when it is made, the Government will take account of four factors: what is best for passengers in terms of connectivity and air fares; what is best for taxpayers in terms of the price we can get for the stake; what is best for the economy overall in terms of competitive access to services in and out of Ireland; and the views of the regulatory authorities on any bid.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I welcome the Minister's statement of fact to the House.  I accept that to an extent he is restricted in what he can say on the decision the Government will ultimately make.  He has outlined the four areas it will consider.  On three, if not four, headings it will find it impossible to accept the proposed offer by Ryanair.  The first is a potential reduction in competition if the two airlines were to be owned by the one entity.  That would represent bad value for the taxpayer in terms of the impact it would have on the capacity of the State to continue to offer low fares to the wider tourism and business sectors.  From a regulatory point of view, the ensuing domination by one entity in controlling such a large volume of activity, across the Irish Sea in particular and into near European markets, would cause serious concern.  This is an island nation which depends heavily on access not just to continental Europe but also to the wider world.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In addition to what the Minister has said, given that the Government has decided to dispose of the shareholding in Aer Lingus, as previously announced, has he considered how he might protect the Heathrow Airport slots, in particular, and access to Heathrow Airport from this country to provide for onward connections to the wider world?  If so, what is the result of the consideration?  The Heathrow Airport connection has been identified as being of significant benefit and strategic importance.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will come back to the Deputy.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Ryanair's continued existence on the share register of Aer Lingus has been a significant retarding factor for Aer Lingus.  Has the Minister discussed the matter with the chief executives of the two airlines in his various contacts with them?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There is very little we can do to protect the Heathrow Airport slots.  At the time of privatisation having a golden share might have been a good idea, but there is nothing to prevent the company from leasing the slots.  This could be done by the board at any time.  The sale of the slots would just require a special motion.It is clear that airlines across Europe are consolidating.  If Aer Lingus has a buyer in the future, probably the best way to secure access to Heathrow Airport is to have a buyer that wants to feed that airport rather than one that wants to use the slots for another purpose.  It seems the British Government is changing its position on a third runway at Heathrow Airport, which means we may find there will be more slots in the future than we thought.  Now that British Airways has taken over BMI, I am reassured to see that it is maintaining access to this country for purely commercial reasons.  I am pleased to see that the fears in that regard have not materialised.The issue of Ryanair continuing to own approximately 30% of Aer Lingus comes up in conversations with the CEOs of the two companies, but it is now one for the United Kingdom Competition Commission.  There would be greater clarity on the future of Aer Lingus if the United Kingdom Competition Commission were to determine whether Ryanair could continue to remain as a shareholder of Aer Lingus before the Government makes decisions.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I accept the Minister's point on future plans for Heathrow Airport.  While the State retains an interest in Aer Lingus, it has the capacity to influence board decisions through the appointments made by the Minister on behalf of the Government.  Although I had noted his point about the golden share, it was not possible to arrange it at the time, as doing so would have been in contravention of EU rules.Will the Government consider the formulation of a battle plan to protect slot access at Heathrow Airport?  In this regard, will it consider establishing a working group to table proposals to the Minister and his Department in order that a vital and necessary element of Ireland's connectivity might be protected?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I have no concerns about access to Heathrow Airport.  There is access through Aer Lingus and British Airways.  Last week my Heathrow-Shannon flight was full, which I was delighted to see.  These connections work because they continue to be profitable.  Should the State be in a position to sell its 25% stake, this is the kind of conversation we would like to have with a buyer.  Among the other issues we would like to discuss are protecting the company's brand and access in so far as possible.  Once 75% or 100% of a company is sold, one's influence is limited.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Deputy's question relates to meetings with trade unions representing workers in Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  I have not formally met trade unions working on behalf of any of the three companies.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, discussions have taken place between unions and Irish Rail, the outcome of which was recently accepted after a ballot of members.  In the case of the bus companies, I understand negotiations with the relevant trade unions are ongoing.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	10	In budget 2012 the Government announced cuts of approximately €22 million for CIE and to the rural transport scheme.  Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann carried much of the 8% loss in funding, resulting in fare increases and the further downgrading of services.  Routes were closed, while others were limited and changed to adapt to the lower funding level.  Our poor and, in many places, non-existent public transport system was further run down.  In early June Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus announced that they would need to put substantial numbers of their workers on the dole if the latter did not engage in so-called reform.  This reform is simply a rowing back on the achievement of decent pay and conditions for workers and the delivery of a decent service.  This is not a choice - it is the inevitable consequence of large cuts to already underfunded services.  Ireland's State transport companies are among the least subsidised, with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	11	A question, please.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am coming to it.  Budget 2013 is being framed an I am asking that we not erode services further.  Will the Minister of State give an indication to this effect and that there will not be major cuts?  Many of the services and workers cannot take any more.  In my area bus services have been cut, with significant consequences.  I urge that further cuts not be made.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	13	In my portfolio I have travelled around the country quite a bit and engaged in dialogue with the relevant workers.  As recently as yesterday, I met workers during my travels.  In the case of CIE, I will continue to engage with the workers informally and their representatives formally.  The situation is not pretty and is difficult to address, as I hope the Deputy appreciates.  Passenger numbers have decreased by 21.7% from their height in 2007, while revenue has decreased by €56.8 million, or some 11.4%, from its height in 2008.  The reduction in the subvention from its height of €45.6 million in 2008 was necessary.  It is a difficult scenario.  There will be a 20% reduction in subvention from 2012 to 2014.There is a cost recovery programme and the Deputy is aware of what is happening in Irish Rail.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the position of Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus as those companies are in the middle of negotiations.  We are considering various other mechanisms to try to improve the volume of people using public transport in conjunction with the great efforts of unions with management in maintaining or limiting costs across the three organisations.  I encourage the Deputy, as a spokesperson on transport, to be part of the discourse in promoting public transport.  Recently there was the launch of the national route planner, the Leap card and real-time passenger information.  There are also other initiatives, including rolling out Wi-Fi across a number of services.  We must get more people using public transport.  We all have a responsibility in this regard given the very difficult position in which we find ourselves.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I promote public transport and I believe in it.  If there is to be a reduction of 20% in the subvention over the next couple of years, it will have significant repercussions.  We should not reduce our public subsidies as there will be significant consequences.  It is important for us to engage with trade unions, which represent workers, and the Minister of State should meet those representatives to reassure them that services will be maintained as best they can.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I thank the Deputy for his comments.  Irish Rail engaged in very detailed negotiations with unions and I am pleased the ballot was passed and the negotiations concluded in a satisfactory way.  There are ongoing negotiations with the representatives of staff in Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus which preclude me from commenting in detail on the outcome.  I am enthusiastic about the co-operation being shown by all parties in these negotiations in very difficult times.  The management and unions working together should be welcomed and endorsed because of their position and the statistics I outlined earlier.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Deputy Mattie McGrath is not here at the moment so we will proceed to Question No. 87.Question No. 86 not taken.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The question relates to the current status of The Gathering project.  I presented proposals for The Gathering Ireland 2013 at the Global Irish Economic Forum last October.  Fáilte Ireland is the lead agency for the implementation of the initiative and has put in place a project executive team to implement it.  Tourism Ireland has specific responsibility for promoting The Gathering in overseas markets and has also provided staff for the project team.The event is intended to be the biggest tourism initiative ever staged in Ireland and will consist of a year-long programme of festivals, events and other gatherings.  The St. Patrick's Day festivities were used for the overseas launch while a major domestic launch took place on Friday, 11 May 2012 in Dublin Castle at an event attended the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, Deputy Ring, and me.  In recent weeks the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has attended events in Manchester and Glasgow to mobilise support among the Irish communities in Britain and I will be attending an event in Brussels next week.  Further major publicity events in our main overseas tourism markets are planned for the remainder of the year.A series of Gathering community meetings are being held throughout Ireland to engage and mobilise local communities and to provide an opportunity to people to learn more about The Gathering and how they can be a part of it.  Meetings have taken place in Roscommon and Castlebar, with a meeting in Ennis planned.  A website has been established with information on how people can play their part in the event, including online support for potential organisers to submit queries and download promotional material.  In addition, social media channels are on stream to promote the event.In terms of resources, a specific ring-fenced additional €5 million allocation has been provided to Fáilte Ireland this year.  This allocation will primarily be used for establishing the support structure and for marketing.  Efforts to secure additional resources for The Gathering will be targeted at engaging potential partners and sponsors.  The Irish tourism trade is also directly involved and is being briefed on progress on an ongoing basis.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank the Minister for the reply.  He is aware his Government set an increase in tourism and visitors to the country as a key strategic component of its jobs initiative.  In doing so the Government reduced the VAT rate on tourism related products, much to the annoyance of private pensioners who, effectively, had to pay for that.  At one stage the Minister questioned to some extent the ability of that measure to increase employment, and that speaks for itself.The tourism numbers for the first three months this year, from the beginning of March to the end of May, show a reduction of approximately 1.1% compared with last year.  There have been approximately 18,000 fewer visitors to the country.  There has been a reduction of approximately 5.7% of the British market and, when one sets this against the fall-off of approximately 3% of Britons travelling in Europe generally, it represents a significant fall-off from our nearest neighbour and our most important market.  What specific measures has the Government taken to address this significant fall-off from our nearest neighbour in the context of promoting Ireland generally and working towards The Gathering next year?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Gathering primarily relates to next year.  Inbound visitor number figures for last year were favourable.  There was an increase of 6% on 2010 after several years of decline.  To date this year we are behind target.  We had targeted a 4% increase this year but so far there has been a 1% decrease in visitor numbers.  This varies however.  For example, there has been an increase from mainland Europe, a significant increase in some cases from Germany, France and the Nordic countries.  There has also been an increase from the long-haul market.  The figures from America are slightly down, by approximately 2%, but they have been improving in the past three months.  Numbers from America were up by 1% on the same period last year.  The figures from Britain are disappointing.  For the first five months the number of visits from Britain were down by 2.3%, set against a 3% fall in the British market in general.  There are fewer British people travelling on account of the ongoing recession there, but we are not losing market share.  The March to May figures shows a 5.7% fall but we should not necessarily read too much into three month statistics for Britain.  Overall the figures are down 2.3% to date this year and this wipes out the gains we are making from mainland Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I welcome the fact the Minister recognises the figures are disappointing.  It is incumbent on the Government to do something.  While one should never read too much into any particular statistical snapshot, it is an indicator.  There has been an effort by the Government to clap itself on the back to some extent because of the notional 6% increase last year based on the figures for the previous year.  My recollection is that the increase was based on the ash cloud.  When the figures are adjusted to take account of the significant reduction in traffic as a result of that event, the increase disappears.  I urge the Government to continue to invest heavily in promoting Ireland abroad in whatever way it can and to have in place a strategic plan to ensure we do not lose market share or visitor numbers.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I offer the figures from mainland Europe.  Figures from Germany are up 10%, figures from France are up by 6%, figures from Italy are up by 9%, figures from the Nordic region are up by 9.5% and those from the Benelux countries are up by 8%.  There are several factors which explain why the British market is depressed and they do not apply only to this side of the Irish Sea.New television advertisements will feature in the coming weeks in Britain, France and Germany, in cinemas in Britain, the United States, Spain and Italy, and there will be outdoor advertising in Britain.  There will be some events around the Olympic Games, including a Gathering event.  The focus will be on these top four markets in particular.  I am reasonably confident we will see better figures in the coming months.  This has been the suggestion from the industry for the coming months, the peak season, because the bookings are strong.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The question relates to the restoration of the Dún Laoghaire baths.  Fáilte Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the tourism capital investment programme.  The development of the project referred to by the Deputy is primarily the responsibility of the relevant local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I am informed by Fáilte Ireland that no application has been received by it in respect of the project.  If a local authority, or any other body, identifies a tourism project with the potential to increase significantly visitor numbers and which it believes would be eligible for tourism capital funding, it should engage directly with Fáilte Ireland.  However, the level of grant allocations and approvals under the programme is such that the existing capital allocations for 2012 and 2013 for tourism product development are fully committed.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In 2004, in the biggest demonstration since 1921, 5,000 people marched in Dún Laoghaire to demand that the council abandon proposals to build a ten-storey private apartment block on the site of Dún Laoghaire baths and force a commitment from it to restore the public swimming baths.  The demonstrators later forced it to commit to a plan in this regard.  After a long delay and endless foot-dragging by the council, last night the Minister's Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues voted to give €1.5 million to the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to place a barge off the east pier in Dún Laoghaire.  The county manager, in supporting the proposal for a barge off the east pier, stated it would allow the council to "exit the baths thing".  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable for his Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues and the county manager to show such contempt for the wishes of the public, so strongly expressed over ten years, that they would abandon the plan to have a swimming pool back on the site of Dún Laoghaire baths?  Would it not be in the interests of the State's tourism infrastructure and the Government's stated commitment to develop tourism to give the people of Dún Laoghaire what they want, namely, restored Victorian swimming baths on Dún Laoghaire seafront?  Acceding to the people's demands would boost tourism in Dún Laoghaire and the wider Dublin area.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this regard by getting the council to restate its commitment to provide the swimming baths and by having the Department become directly involved in providing funding therefor.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I am flattered a little by the Deputy's question.  I am the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and have a considerable number of responsibilities across a number of areas, including aviation and the ports, in respect of which I work with the Ministers of State Deputies Alan Kelly and Michael Ring.  I am a little surprised that the priority question from the Technical Group is essentially about a local issue affecting Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in which I will not intervene because it is a matter for local government.  It is a matter for the elected representatives on the council to make decisions without having regard to me.  If they want to talk to us about their plans or capital funding, we will be happy to do so.  However, they have not done so as yet.  I am advised that they have allocated €2.5 million from the capital budget to carry out works on the pavilion and baths site and provide a jetty and other amenities.  This is entirely a matter for the council to decide.  I do not have a role.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Dún Laoghaire seafront is a national tourism asset of great significance.  Dublin is the biggest tourism hub in the country.  To develop the seafront in Dún Laoghaire and provide amenities there is of national significance.  There was widespread support across the city of Dublin for the campaign against the privatisation of the seafront and to demand the restoration of Dún Laoghaire baths.  There was support from all over the country because people understood restoring the public swimming amenity and the Victorian heritage of the seafront would be a great boost for tourism in Dublin and that the provision of amenities would be of citywide and national significance.  It is, therefore, the Minister's business.  His Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are playing politics with the issue to the detriment of the interest of the residents and the Government's stated objective to develop tourism infrastructure and create employment therefrom.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I am not sure what question the Deputy is asking, but I wish to make two comments.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour is a wonderful amenity for the State.  I often visit and will be attending the youth sailing championships there in the near future.  I do not know whether renovating the Victorian baths would result in international tourists flocking to Dún Laoghaire.  That would have to be assessed, but I trust the elected representatives in Dún Laoghaire to make these decisions for their area.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 89, 119, 127 and 735 together.Central Statistics Office figures for January to May 2012 indicate that visits from overseas to Ireland are broadly in line with 2011 levels, with a marginal decrease of 0.7%.  Last year we saw growth in overseas visits to Ireland for the first time since 2007.  While the figures have been on a par this year, I remain confident that we will see growth in the months ahead.  The industry remains positive for the peak season based on inquiries and bookings, although clearly the outcome will depend on global economic conditions and consumer confidence being maintained in our key markets.The global downturn has had a lasting impact on consumer behaviour, with tourists taking fewer short trips at off-peak times.  Ireland is not immune to this trend.  However, there are good reasons to be confident that we are on track for sustainable growth.  Inbound capacity on flights into Ireland is set to rise by 3% this summer.  Ireland has the most competitively priced hotel rooms in western Europe.  The Government continues to invest in overseas marketing and our attractive tourism product.We have had over 2.3 million overseas visits to Ireland this year.  However, we cannot afford to be complacent.  The entire tourism sector must keep fighting for business.  The tourism agencies will continue to promote the fact that this is the best time to visit Ireland in terms of value and the wide range of things to see and do, including exciting events such as the Notre Dame-Navy football game in September which attract significant numbers from overseas.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, and I will directly support the industry in promoting Irish tourism overseas in the months ahead, building on preparations for the Gathering Ireland 2013.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I thank the Minister for his positive answer and I am pleased by his optimistic outlook for the tourism sector.  I ask for his views on the link between tourism and sports, particularly golf.  According to Fáilte Ireland, a golf tourist is worth almost three times the value of an average tourist to this country.  The average spend by a golf visitor is approximately €1,300.  It is estimated that 155,000 overseas visitors play golf during their time in Ireland.  Their total spend is approximately €240 million per annum, not to mention the thousands of jobs they help to create.  I ask the Minister for his views on an all-Ireland promotion of the golfing industry in view of the emphasis placed on golf competitions in Northern Ireland.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, has primary responsibility for sports tourism, but I agree with the Deputy on the value of golf as a tourism product.  It is a good product for us.  A golf promotion entitled, Home of the Champions, is under way using Pádraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell as the face of golf.  We also have an arrangement with Northern Ireland which allowed the Irish Open to be held in the North last weekend.  The event will return to the Republic next year.  We recognise the importance of this issue on which significant work is under way.  Slightly better weather would also help but, unfortunately, we do not have control over that.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Is the Minister considering developing heritage-based tourism?  Many foreign visitors come here for our striking landscapes, rich history and cultural heritage.  Developing this sector makes perfect sense when one considers that for every €1 spent by the Heritage Council, the tourism sector receives €4.40 through increased tourism revenues.  Does the Minister agree that developing heritage-based tourism would boost employment and that this, in turn, has the potential to provide an ongoing stream of sustainable income for cities and towns nationwide?  Does he plan to keep the VAT rate in the hospitality sector at its current level which is providing a major boost to restaurants?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The 9% VAT rate introduced by the Minister for Finance in the jobs initiative will be maintained until at least the end of 2013.  After that, I do not know what the position will be as it is a matter for Government.  Lest I have speculated on the budget for 2013, I certainly will not speculate on the budget for 2014.I concur fully with the Deputy on the important issue of heritage.  Many people want to visit this country to see our castles and learn about our history.  Although tourists tend to be divided roughly into categories, they include a specific group of sightseers and culture seekers who are known to spend most.  Much of what we do is focused on this group.  I am aware of the Heritage Council's estimate that every €1 invested in heritage delivers a return of €4.40 in tourism revenue, and while I do not wish to cast aspersions on the council, I am always sceptical of such calculations.  In some ways, they are a form of Jack and the Beanstalk economics.  If matters were that easy, we would spend €1 billion and get €4 billion back.  I am often sceptical about the methodologies used to calculate returns on investment.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The visit of Queen Elizabeth II last year was a major success in promoting Ireland in England.  In light of efforts to increase tourist numbers, will consideration be given to running a special promotion in Britain to persuade people to follow in the Queen's footsteps and visit the various locations on her itinerary?  That would be a worthwhile initiative.

Her visit to Cashel, which was a major part of her trip, was great.  I was pleased to visit Carrick-on-Suir with the Deputy last week.  Unfortunately, we did not visit Cashel but perhaps we can do so the next time I visit the area.  A report is being done at Department level and in consultation with the industry on what we can do to better harness the British market.  Half of all overseas tourists come from Britain where our tourism industry is not making the recovery we would like.  Some work is being carried out to identify what can be done to improve our position in the British market.  British people now travel less than they have for a long time.  I recall reading a stark statistic showing that British people travel abroad less than they did in 1989.  The United Kingdom is our most important market by a mile and even a 2% or 3% increase in numbers from Britain would be worth more than a 10% or 20% increase from the long haul markets.

I was fortunate to visit the Irish Open in Portrush, for which more than 100,000 tickets were sold.  It was sold out despite the weather.  I also saw the "Home of the Champions" campaign in full flight and found it very impressive.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has spoken previously of developing Ireland as a golf capital.  That would be a welcome initiative and we should do all we can to support it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	39	On the returns on investment in cultural heritage, cultural heritage is an end in itself.  Given the dire economic circumstances, many people believe that investing in our heritage infrastructure and improving access to it could have significant economic spin-off effects.  Consequently, the Minister must take a more hands-on approach in this regard.  I am sorry to be parochial but this is important.  I will cite three examples of the failure to do this within my own constituency.  I have just mentioned the Dún Laoghaire baths and the council's ten-year refusal to invest in this site, which could enhance the heritage and tourist amenity of Dún Laoghaire.  The Joyce tower now has been closed, essentially because of the public sector recruitment embargo.  Moreover, the council lacks the resources to facilitate small boat owners in organising trips for the public across to Dalkey Island to see the Martello tower there.  This is in a small stretch.  It is the Minister's business if local authorities lack either the will or the resources to ensure public and tourist access to such vital heritage amenities or if they do not have the available resources to restore them and bring them up to a level at which they would encourage tourists to visit the country.

A county-by-county breakdown of the applications received and the amounts of funding sought will be circulated with the Official Report.  These figures are subject to minor amendment as assessments are undertaken.Departmental officials have started processing all applications received.  This process will take some time, due to the volume of applications and the detailed information contained in each one.  As a result, I do not expect to be in a position to announce the list of successful applicants before the late autumn or early winter 2012.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of applications expected to be successful.

#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  First, I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government for resurrecting the sports capital programme for the first time in a number of years, which is to be welcomed.  As the Minister of State has noted, more than 2,150 applications were received; it is evident there is huge interest in the entire process.If the Minister of State does not mind me being parochial, I seek the figures for County Carlow.  I am always concerned about Carlow's small size and its being part of a dual constituency, because I note the smaller county in such constituencies always appears to lose out.  Has a decision been taken on how the money will be allocated?  Will it be on a per-head-of-population or a county-by-county basis?  All Members are aware there are the same number of sports organisations in each county and it is important that they receive adequate funding.  The Minister of State also should indicate whether additional funding will become available later on in the year through the local authorities, as was the case in the past year, for swimming pools or outdoor equipment, which are of great benefit to a large number of constituents.  The Minister of State visited my part of the country in recent weeks where he saw at first hand the benefit of funding for swimming pools and sports equipment.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	59	There are 44 applications for funding worth €3,046,252 in the Deputy's county of Carlow.  My officials and I are drawing up the guidelines on how we will deal with the applications.  We want to see whether there are big or small applications, and when they have been assessed, we will draw up the guidelines on how the funding is to be spent.I would like to provide some figures to dampen down expectations, because the Deputy is correct to say that expectations are high.  There were 1,453 applications worth €293 million in 2008, but only 685 groups got funding, even though the Government of the day had €50 million to spend.  I have 2,152 applications to date and I have €30 million available.  It is small money when put into the overall context.  We will try to distribute this money as fairly as possible, and we will draw up the regulations very shortly.  We want to see whether the applications are big or small and then we will make a decision.I do not want to see a situation arise like that which occurred in 2008, when the Government had €50 million to spend.  There were schemes in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the last scheme was in 2008.  We did very well in very difficult times, and I thank the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for allowing us to spend €30 million.  There is a massive demand for funding, but I want to see that funding targeted in areas where it will be spent.  I do not want to see the situation that occurred before when €55 million worth of grants were allocated and were not drawn down.  I will not be giving small amounts of money to big schemes so that the money will not be drawn down.

There are many clubs looking for funding and we are in straitened times.  I know that the money will be well spent when it is given out.  Where applications from clubs are not successful, would it be possible to have their applications kept on file?  Instead of having to go to the expense of putting in another application, if we are lucky enough to have another round next year, we might keep the unsuccessful applications and look at them for future funding.

With resources so scarce, we will be looking to have shared facilities and participation where people will actually be taking part.Deputy Deering asked a question about the swimming pool scheme last year.  We are looking at other ways and means of dealing with it.  Deputy Lawlor's question on applications has been put to me before, and it is something the Minister and I will examine.  Given the number of applications, we can only deal with a small percentage of them.  Perhaps we could look at the Deputy's suggestion, but we are not making a decision on it now.  We are currently adjudicating on those applications that are being made, we are putting them in order and we will see how we can facilitate and allocate that money as fairly as possible.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I commend the Minister of State on being able, in these straitened times, to find €30 million in resources to put into the sports capital programme and for recognising the importance of this project.  I am startled to hear the figures for my own county of Kildare where, as noted by Deputy Lawlor, there has been €8 million worth of applications, which is almost one third of the amount in the national pot.  This case of loaves and fishes is because we have had four years without a scheme due to the failure of the previous Government.  This has left a backlog, and a huge number of clubs which wanted to progress with work are now unable to do so.While great credit is due that this amount is available, it is obvious there will be huge disappointment because there is not enough money to go around to all the clubs that want it.  I was secretary of my GAA club for seven years and I know the benefit that sports capital grants have brought.It is important to note the population of Kildare has doubled in the past 20 years, and it is one of the fastest growing counties in the country.  I stress it is important that due acknowledgement is given to this point because it is a county which has seen huge influx of people coming to live there and a huge amount of development.  We need to be able to match that by providing sporting facilities for these people.I welcome the comments of the Minister of State in regard to integrated and shared facilities and I agree we need to maximise our facilities by obtaining the best use out of them.  At a time of serious childhood obesity and all the rest, it is important we target this money at areas where there is a lack of facilities.  I hope that will happen.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Shared facilities will be the big issue because resources are so scarce at present.  If the Deputy thinks he has problems in Kildare, I will tell him what is happening in Mayo, as I was expecting someone to ask me that question.  Mayo has applications for 114 projects worth €15.745 million, so they will be looking for 50% of the pot.  What can I do?  We all have problems.I want to dampen down expectations.  I ask all Members of the House not to be leading groups up the garden path.  There is no point telling them there is a pot of gold when there is not.

I do not want expectations to be raised.  I know there are Deputies who are already showing the list and asking people to make applications.  That is one of the things that happened during this round.  I am disappointed that people were brought to public meetings, encouraged to make applications and encouraged to contact and put pressure on their TDs.  We have only €30 million and it will not be easy to distribute it.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Like other Deputies, I would like to know what sort of community groups and sporting organisations applied in my local area.  When the Minister of State is giving us the breakdown, he might include socio-economic status and the proportion of clubs and groups in disadvantaged areas that applied.  Has the Minister of State plans to launch special schemes for local authorities like the schemes in regard to swimming pools last year, which were very successful?  Special schemes could be used locally for groups that are disappointed.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	74	With regard to the Deputy's area, Cork has 217 applications worth €21,083,163.  Within the Department, we are at present looking to find other ways to assist sporting organisations.  The Deputy is correct with regard to the local authority schemes last year.  I want to put this on the record very clearly for the two major newspapers in this country.  I was criticised in regard to Mayo getting priority.  That is not true.  Every local authority that made applications for grant aid got it and every local authority that made applications for grant aid for swimming pools got it.  The only local authorities that did not get funding were those that did not follow the one criterion, which was that the local authority must own the land.  Even having been given the criteria, they still made applications when they did not own the land.  I want to put that on the record. Per capita, it was Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, and in terms of money, it was Dublin and Cork, that got the highest amounts.  I would appreciate it if the national media might cover that and correct the inaccuracies that were put in the national newspapers in recent weeks.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 154 and 708 together.These questions relate to the Smarter Transport Bill, which was introduced last year by Deputy Eoghan Murphy as a Private Members' Bill, and the related matters of electric vehicles and car clubs.  The purpose of the Smarter Transport Bill is twofold.  First, it aims to promote electric car use by allowing local authorities to make by-laws for the provision and use of charging bays on public roads.  Second, it aims to promote the development of car clubs by allowing road authorities to make by-laws for the control and regulation of parking by car club vehicles on public roads.I support the promotion of electric and hybrid vehicles as one of the ways to reduce pollution and improve our environment.  With the current state of technology, which is advancing all the time, there are limits on the distance electric cars can travel before recharging.  The provision of recharging points is, therefore, an important component in encouraging the use of electric cars.Car clubs have proven very successful in other jurisdictions, especially in Germany and the United Kingdom.  A particular benefit is that families often find that by joining a car club they can avoid the need for a second family car, especially in cases where they might need a second vehicle only occasionally.  As with electric cars, I am also in favour of car clubs as a way of reducing the number of vehicles on our roads.  I am, therefore, very happy to support appropriate measures to promote electric cars and car clubs.I have met Deputy Murphy on the subject and conveyed my support for the principle of promoting electric cars and car clubs as set out in his Private Members' Bill.  My Department is engaged in work on the development of the next road traffic Bill, which I hope to publish at the end of 2012.  This Bill will address a number of issues and will provide an opportunity to consider proposals for facilitating electric cars and car clubs.  As far as is possible, I intend to include the proposed measures from the Smarter Transport Bill in the road traffic Bill.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I thank Deputy Connaughton for tabling the question and the Minister for his positive response.  I know he is very supportive of the measures contained in the Smarter Transport Bill 2011.  GoCar, which is a company looking to introduce car clubs and electric car vehicles to our public streets, re-launched the company only last week following some recent investment, so the companies are in place and are ready to go.I introduced the Smarter Transport Bill last year for the Friday sittings, although, unfortunately, it has not been taken yet as there is a very busy schedule.  One development since then is that I introduced the Tax Transparency Bill this year, which means the Smarter Transport Bill is no longer in competition for debate and for approval by the Dáil.  I urge the Minister to do as much as he can to transpose the content of the Smarter Transport Bill into the road traffic Bill 2012 and, at the same time, to notify local authorities that these changes are coming, one hopes, in order that they can prepare the necessary by-laws in advance.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	78	As far as is possible we will integrate those provisions into the road traffic Bill 2012.  The Friday sessions have been very useful in giving Deputies an opportunity to bring forward their own legislation.  It seems to me that the Opposition always wins the lottery and I am not sure why that is.  I certainly welcome the Bill and its provisions.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I support the idea of smarter transport and I support this Bill.  I would like to see a big debate on this because we all know the environmental advantages we can get from moving towards supporting electric and hybrid cars and moving away from fossil fuels, as well as other issues in terms of protecting this economy.  It is very important for environmental reasons that we have a good debate on this and that we all put forward our own ideas.

There will be huge savings for the whole economy and also in terms of the environment.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Bill will go to committee, where there will detailed discussion.  The take-up for electric vehicles has been pretty slow and there are more charging points than there are vehicles.  There is one at my local train station and I do not believe I have ever seen it being used.  I am going to try out a car for the weekend and see what it is like.  What many people do not know is that the electricity is actually for free.  To be fair, the ESB has done a very good job in trying to promote electrical vehicles.  It is even doing it to the extent that it will charge a person's car for free, which seems a very generous offer.Question No. 92 withdrawn.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 153 together.These questions relate to my engagement with the haulage industry.  I know that Deputies Áine Collins and Heather Humphreys have been seriously involved in issues relating to the haulage sector since their election.  I recognise the important role of the sector in the transport of goods and the difficulties it is facing in the current climate.   My officials and I have met representative organisations on several occasions and I am due to meet them again in the coming days.One of the main concerns of the sector is fuel prices.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has established a working group to examine taxes and duties on fuel.  I understand this group has completed its work and reported back to the Minister.  The industry has also expressed concerns about unfair competition from illegal and unlicensed hauliers which I was able to address in the Road Transport Act 2011 which substantially increased fines for illegal hauliers and consignors who use them, of up to €500,000 and three years in prison.To improve services for operators, my Department is working on a computer project to go live in early 2013.  It will provide an online licence application system and also allow operators to view and manage their own fleet records with the Department.  The project will also support compliance monitoring and enforcement by facilitating communication with enforcement authorities throughout the European Union.Another issue of interest to some haulage operators is cabotage carried out in the United Kingdom.  I have met my UK counterpart on this issue and the two Departments are working together to identify what progress can be made on a bilateral basis.Road safety is clearly important for the haulage sector.  The Oireachtas recently enacted legislation that will transform the system for the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles.  This will lead to an improvement in the quality and safety of commercial vehicles on the roads, thereby enhancing the reputation of the haulage industry.  In addition, following representations from the industry and consultation with the relevant road safety and enforcement agencies, earlier this year I signed a statutory instrument into law increasing the maximum speed limit on motorways for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, from 80 km/h to 90 km/h.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I thank the Minister for his answer and acknowledge his efforts to assist the haulage industry, as well as recognising its important role.  As he stated, Deputy Áine Collins and I have been involved in a working group set up by the Minister for Finance last February to discuss and find solutions to two of the most pressing problems facing the industry, namely, fuel costs and fuel laundering.  The group included members of the Irish Road Haulage Association and officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue.  I thank the members of the association for their commitment and honesty in trying to resolve the issues, as well as the significant amount of work they did and the information they provided for the Department of Finance.  The working group's findings have been submitted to the Minister.As an exporting country, the haulage sector will play an essential role in our economic recovery through the delivery of goods to the United Kingdom and across Europe.  We need the industry to be strong, vibrant and competitive.  This is particularly true of the Cavan-Monaghan region because we have no rail service, which makes it completely dependent on the haulage industry.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to look at the findings of the working group?  When will he discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Deputy is absolutely correct in drawing attention to the importance of the haulage industry.  Even for parts of Ireland with a rail service, 95% of all freight is transported by road.  This will always be the case in a country of this size and with such dispersed settlement patterns.  Haulage is absolutely essential as the country would not function without such a service.  We all remember during the heavy snow two years ago how shops were literally on the verge of running out of food because the haulage industry could not function in the bad weather.  I have seen the report but have not yet had an opportunity to discuss it with the Minister for Finance.  I will certainly do so in advance of the budget.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I would like questions to be brief because many Deputies want to come in on this issue.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Is the Minister aware of the issue of the essential user rebate of which other countries such as Belgium, France and Luxembourg avail and the effect it has on Irish hauliers?  We have many hauliers filling their fuel tanks abroad, which means a loss of revenue to the State.  What are the Minister's views on this rebate and would he support the reintroduction of such an initiative here?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I am aware the essential user rebate was abolished several years ago.  It was of great financial benefit to the haulage industry, as well as to private bus operators and CIE.  Its reintroduction would improve the financial position of CIE, private bus operators and the haulage industry, but it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider.  In coming to a decision on it, he would have to weigh up several factors.  On the plus side, if we could reduce tank tourism, we might gain more revenue for the State.  However, on the down side, there is the cost of the rebate.  It is a matter I will discuss with the Minister for Finance.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Deputy Áine Humphreys referred to the significant issue of fuel laundering.  Does the Minister have an update on the progress made in solving this problem?  In the past it was predominantly a Border issue.  Now, however, it is like Shaws in that it is almost nationwide.  It poses a serious problem for the industry.  Has any progress been made in ensuring those causing the problem are brought to justice?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I am aware of the issue, but I cannot answer the Deputy's question as it is handled by the Department of Finance and Revenue.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies Áine Collins and Heather Humphreys, on their work with the working group on fuel prices.  I thank the Minister for his comments on his work with his UK counterpart on cabotage.  When it was introduced in Europe, the knock-on implications for Irish hauliers in the United Kingdom were not envisaged.  We now have the ludicrous situation where Irish hauliers need to come back from there with empty trailers.  It is killing the industry.  I know of specific cases of specialised Irish hauliers who in transporting parts for wind turbines in Scotland, owing to the cabotage rules, were forced to return with empty trailers.  I encourage the Minister to continue his work in finding a solution to this problem.  We cannot lose hauliers at a time when the economy is in a difficult position.  It is hauliers we are going to need to transport goods and produce as the economy grows.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The rules on cabotage are absurd in what is supposed to be a single European market.  In a nutshell, they mean an Irish haulier in Britain or a British haulier in Ireland can only take three journeys between the two countries within a period of seven days.  This is absurd, given that there is free movement of people, trade and goods across the European Union.  The Benelux countries have an arrangement which means hauliers can operate freely in the three countries in question.  It seems to work well for them.  It appears it predates European law and is, therefore, an exception to the cabotage regulations.  What we are working on is a bilateral agreement to create a common haulage area of Britain and Ireland.  However, it may be difficult to do this because it may be contrary to the European directive on cabotage.  The other option, supported by the European Commission, is to get rid of cabotage and have a common European area for haulage.  However, some larger member states, in particular, are resisting this.  It is the Government's policy to eliminate these restrictions.  To do so, however, it would need the co-operation of our British and European colleagues.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Local authorities are spending up to €4 million on the environmental clean-up of the sludge from fuel laundering, most of which is dumped on farms and roadsides.  Is the Minister in contact with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on whether a grant may be made available to local authorities to meet these clean-up costs?  Is he in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality on increasing prison sentences or the fines for those found guilty of fuel laundering?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I have not been in contact with the two Departments on this matter.  The issue of washed diesel and so on falls to Revenue and the Department of Finance.  While it is not one we have discussed around the table yet, the Deputy's suggestion is valid.  It is one of those matters that does not necessarily fall to any one Department and is not addressed for that reason.  It is an issue about which the Departments and agencies involved need to have a conflab in the next few weeks.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is welcome that the Minister acknowledges the significant positive impact of the haulage industry on industry in general and the country's commercial future.  Does he accept the elephant in the room for the haulage industry is high fuel prices and that it is a major concern in terms of employment in the industry?  Does he accept that many HGVs regularly breach the prohibition on driving through residential areas?  I have experience in Dublin bay north of HGVs breaching the regulations by driving down Griffith Avenue, one of the nicest avenues in Europe.  What they are doing is completely against the law.  Will the Minister take action on this issue?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Fuel prices are very high.  That is not just the case for hauliers, however.  They are high for all of us.  High fuel prices do not just impact on hauliers; they also have an impact on motorists and bus companies.  While prices are high, they are by no means the highest in Europe.  For example, fuel prices are higher in the UK and France.  Ireland is not the worst offender in this regard but I acknowledge that prices here are high and that this is putting pressure on households, in terms of their income, and businesses.The enforcement of the law relating to HGVs is entirely a matter for the Garda and local authorities.  That is not a matter in respect of which I can provide assistance.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Apart from issues such as VAT and rebates, the cost of fuel in general is of concern to companies which use vans and other large vehicles.  One action we can take is to ensure the best level possible will be set in the legislation which is being debated by the European Parliament and which relates to new limits for manufacturers in respect of van emissions.  The level currently under discussion in this regard is not as good proportionately as that which relates to smaller vehicles.  I am informed that the level to which I refer is based on a miscalculation of the emission figures for vans in production at present.  Moves to improve the efficiency of vehicles used in the road haulage industry would lead to major long-term savings for the companies involved.  If such moves are not made, this could lead to a dramatic increase in the cost of doing business in the future.There have been reports in The Sunday Business Post to the effect that progress has been made in the context of combating the major problem of fuel laundering through the use of new dyes, etc.  We must find a means whereby we can stop people tampering with fuel.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Minister referred to the cost of fuel in general and our level of dependence on road haulage.  What progress has his Department made in the context of trying to get freight back onto our railways?  I refer, in particular, to the possibility of routing freight through our deep water ports.  In my constituency we have one of the deepest ports in the country and an unused rail line.  Has the Department made any progress in the context of getting the rail line to which I refer reopened for either bulk or container traffic or both?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	99	It is interesting that Deputy Ellis appears to know a great deal about fuel laundering, etc.  He certainly seems to know a little more about the subject than I do.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I do not know where the Minister got that impression.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Deputy Ellis also reads The Sunday Business Post now.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Order, please.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Perhaps Deputy Ellis might agree to meet me in private in order to inform me about the tricks of the trade and so on.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I do not know what the Minister is implying but I take offence at what he said.  I have never supported anyone who has been involved in fuel laundering.  I want to make that clear.  The Minister should withdraw the remark he made.  There has been an insinuation that I am doing something illegal and that is just not acceptable.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I assure the Deputy that I am not insinuating that he is doing anything illegal.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Well, what was the Minister saying?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I am just impressed by the Deputy's level of knowledge with regard to what is happening in the area in question.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I do not know how the Minister can be impressed, particularly as I have not imparted any knowledge to him.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Fuel laundering is a matter for the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are a number of things which could be done in terms of adding markers, etc., to fuel.  Isotope markers appear to be an option in this regard.The level of freight being carried by rail is increasing slightly.  Irish Rail's business in this area is now quite profitable, which was not the case in the past.  Dublin has been connected to the port railway network, with the rails running under the crane for the first time.  Preliminary discussions have taken place with Irish Rail in the context of reopening the line to Shannon-Foynes.  However, the Deputy will accept that those discussions are commercial in nature.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Is the Minister in a position to assure the House that none of this illegal diesel is making its way into the school transport system, possibly through its use by private operators?  Is there a mechanism in place to monitor the position in this regard?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I am afraid I cannot provide assurances in that regard.  Again, this matter does not fall within my remit.  The Deputy's question would probably be best answered by the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jim Daly - the need for an emergency fund for uninsured victims of recent flooding; (2) Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív - the need for CIÉ and Iarnród Éireann to protect their property rights and encroachment onto their property in order to facilitate the development of disused railway lines; (3) Deputy Michelle Mulherin - the need to make provision for two intermediate care teams in north and south Mayo to allow for better use of acute hospital resources; (4) Deputy Willie Penrose - media mergers which are predicated upon the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers; (5) Deputy Peadar Tóibín - recent proposals regarding the accident and emergency services at Navan Hospital; (6) Deputy Joan Collins - a separate cystic fibrosis hospital building on the grounds of St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; (7) Deputies Simon Harris, Robert Troy, Maureen O'Sullivan and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin - the need for an update on the status of the €35 million committed in the budget for community mental health services, the appointment of a director for mental health and the ring-fencing of staff for community mental health teams; (8) Deputy Tony McLoughlin - the need for urgent action by the Government to address the high unemployment levels in County Leitrim and the need for an IDA Ireland-backed project for Carrick-on-Shannon; (9) Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl - to ask the Minister for Health if he will reassure users that services will be maintained and the future of Moore Abbey, Monasterevin, County Kildare, is secure despite a reported €1.1 million deficit, and if he will take steps to ensure that it will be urgently repaid €650,000 in grace-period lump-sum payments from the HSE; (10) Deputies Jerry Buttimer and Michael McGrath - assistance available and future preventative measures following recent flooding in Cork; (11) Deputy Michael Conaghan - the growing problem of street crime in Dublin city centre, particularly at night; (12) Deputy Olivia Mitchell - the role of GPS jammers in the increasing number of burglaries and the need to reconsider Statutory Instrument No. 307 - Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009 - which lays down the sole recommended standard for monitored alarms; (13) Deputy Kevin Humphreys - the need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to address the ongoing issue of flooding from heavy rainfall in the Dublin area due to poor drainage; (14) Deputy Clare Daly - the industrial dispute between the catering company SSP and bar workers at Dublin Airport's terminal 1 whom it wants to make redundant; (15) Deputy Joe Higgins - the industrial dispute between the catering company SSP and bar workers at Dublin Airport's terminal 1 whom it wants to make redundant; (16) Deputy John Lyons - the case of the former employees of the Fáilte Bar in Dublin Airport since the bar was closed and then reopened under a new name; (17) Deputy Niall Collins - to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss the rise in charges for Greyhound Waste and associated waste issues in Dublin; (18) Deputy Michael Moynihan - to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss departmental inspections in light of adverse weather conditions during the past month; (19) Deputy Dara Calleary - to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to discuss efforts to curb violent assaults on our cities' streets; (20) Deputy Mattie McGrath - the cost associated with and the saga relating to the e-voting machine fiasco and the need for lessons to be learned as a result; (21) Deputy Tom Hayes - planning restrictions relating to Emly national school, County Tipperary; (22) Deputy James Bannon - the need to provide adequate funding to St. Christopher's Services, Longford; and (23) Deputy Derek Keating - the need to address the problem of those who still drive on learner permits despite not being accompanied by qualified drivers and who continue to be issued with such permits in subsequent years.The matters raised by Deputies Willie Penrose, Jerry Buttimer and Michael McGrath, Tom Hayes and Peadar Tóibín have been selected for discussion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Life is extremely difficult for small to medium-size employers and those who create jobs.  Domestic demand in particular is both poor and sluggish.  People in the sector to which I refer require certainty and clarity.  There is a growing sense that the sector is under attack as a result of the VAT increase of 2%, the decrease relating to redundancy rebates from 60% to 15% and the proposals on sick leave pay.  Most recently, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, hinted at the prospect of PRSI increases for both employers and employees.  The issues to which I refer are undermining confidence in small to medium-size businesses.  They are also undermining their ability to plan with certainty and clarity to the end of this year and for 2013.  The small to medium-size sector is the engine room when it comes to employment creation in this country.  It is the sector on which we rely most in this regard.The Minister for Social Protection was quite clear in the speech she delivered at the weekend which related to PRSI and the Social Insurance Fund.  She focused on whether benefits should be cut or PRSI rates increased.  Her speech was clearly written with a view towards the latter because, as the Minister pointed out, Ireland has the second lowest such rates in the EU.  She said, "It is clear to me that something has to give.  We can either make a decision ... to reduce the level of benefits ... or else we can ... properly fund these benefits both now and into the future".  Does the Taoiseach accept that, as an anonymous Fine Gael Minister articulated to The Irish Times this morning, an increase in PRSI is the same as an increase in income tax?  Is such an increase being considered by the Government?  Does the Taoiseach also accept that people who are creating jobs, particularly those in the small to medium-size sector, feel they are under consistent attack from the Government in respect of the various matters to which I refer?  Above all, does he agree that all of this is leading to a chronic uncertainty which is damaging confidence and the capacity to plan ahead?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	115	No, I do not get the impression that there is an assumption that small and medium enterprises and employers are under attack from the Government.  People throughout the country understand that the difference between what we take in and what we spend is quite significant.  The problem will not be dealt with by thinking about it, it requires political action.  That is why this Government has made it a priority that jobs and those who create them deserve support and will continue to receive support.  With the current crisis and the uncertainty in the banking sector, the Government has introduced the partial loan credit guarantee scheme and introduced the microfinance agency scheme to allow access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises and for employers who want to take on new employees.  That is why the Government negotiated with the troika to rejig the memorandum of understanding to allow for a reduction in VAT in the hospitality sector.  That is why the Government rejigged the universal social charge and has clearly set out its emphasis of trying to reduce an unemployment level that is much too high where the indigenous economy has suffered from a serious lack of confidence.  That is why the Government appointed a specific Minister of State to deal with small businesses.The Government will make a decision about the budget for 2013.  What is clear is that we have set targets in respect of the ceilings allocated to each Department for the three years ahead.  We set out to achieve the reduction of 7.6% by the end of 2013.  I have no intention of speculating on comments arising from the matters raised by Deputy Martin.  These are matters for the Government to decide as a Cabinet and it is in the people's interest that, when the decisions are made by the Government in respect of the budget, there should be full, open and public debate about how the decisions are arrived at and the reasons behind them.  Beyond that, I do not wish to go.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am not asking the Taoiseach to speculate on any old comment.  The Taoiseach did not answer the question I asked, about whether an increase in PRSI is the same as an increase in income tax.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can answer that when he responds.  This was a considered speech by a senior Minister in the Taoiseach's Government.  Last week, we were all briefed to the effect that this would not happen any more and that there would be no more articulation of individual positions.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has produced a very considered, comprehensive and well-argued paper about a range of issues.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Deputy Martin did not get that paper in Cork.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	118	The people in the sector do not know what is happening, have no idea what their costs will be and have no sense of direction.  The Government has an obligation to provide clarity to people creating jobs in this country because they are not getting it at the moment.  The only clarity on job targets we received from the Government is that the projected increase in employment has been reduced by 40,000 as of the April review of the Government's target.  We now acknowledge that the Government cannot create as many jobs as it said it would create a year ago.  Does the Taoiseach accept that an increase in PRSI is the same as an increase in income tax?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the speech of the Minister for Social Protection was not idle speculation but was putting a core question to the Taoiseach and to the Fine Gael Party that PRSI should be increased, notwithstanding any pre-election commitment or commitment in the programme for Government not to increase income tax?

There was no sense of certainty, no plan and no strategy to deal with the problem we faced.  That is partly why the Government reduced PRSI for employers and those with particular wage categories, which created substantial employment and made it easier for employers to hold onto employees.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	141	This State has the fifth highest unemployment rate in the eurozone.  We now have 30% youth unemployment, which does not include those in education or training.  It goes higher and the statistics would be even higher if we included the 70,000 young people who emigrated.  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach, mar is fear áitiúil é, go bhfuil a lán cruachás á fhulaingt ag teaghlaigh ó d'imigh a ndaoine óga, agus is léir nach mbeidh cuid mhaith de óige na tíre ag filleadh ar ais.

The social consequences of this include the widening divide across the State, the absence of equality and a steady increase in poverty, which the Government should be alarmed about.  What specific proposals will the Taoiseach bring forward to tackle youth unemployment?  Does he agree these figures are alarming?  What incentives will the Government provide to companies to take on young people for real jobs on a long-term basis?  Will the Government produce, as we have advocated, an investment strategy aimed at areas such as green energy, agrifood, the ICT sector and tourism, based on equality and putting young people at the heart of rebuilding the economy?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I am very unhappy at the level of unemployment generally and particularly youth unemployment.  This is a problem that is not that easy to rectify.  As we know, young people leave the country for other lands to find work.  That is why the Government focused on the JobBridge scheme, which has 6,000 people employed, and the Springboard and Tús schemes, which make particular reference to young people.  In identifying unemployment generally as a real challenge, the Government published a report with 270 propositions for businesses to open doors, to ensure that credit is available to businesses.  The second quarterly report of the action plan is due for publication very shortly.  I hope the measures being taken will add to the first report and make it more beneficial and effective for employers.  The conclusions of the European Council meeting last week raised these issues as a follow-up to the previous meeting, where I was involved in discussions.  The point at index (d) in the conclusions, which I am sure the Deputy has read, dealing with unemployment and addressing the social consequences of unemployment for young people in particular - 50% in Spain and Greece, and rising in other countries - recommended stepping up efforts to increase youth employment, notably to improve young people's first experience with work and their participation within the labour market, with the objective that within a few months of leaving school, young people either receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship that can be supported by the ESF, and developing and implementing effective policies to combat poverty and support vulnerable groups.The recommendation was for member states to implement their national jobs plans swiftly and effectively, to develop more ambitious and precise plans for national jobs for the next European semester, to avail of the opportunities that are now going to become available under the enhanced leverage from the European Investment Bank, resulting from the fact the Council agreed the project bonds, which had only applied on the intercontinental infrastructure projects but which can now apply to all countries, and for creative use of unused structural funds, with particular reference to young people.  These are opportunities on which Government will reflect following the decisions of the European Council meeting last week with specific reference to youth unemployment.  Through our own action plans for jobs and opportunities the Minister of State with responsibility for small business will continue to present, we will give more young people the opportunity to work and avail of opportunities in Ireland rather than having to leave.I share the Deputy's view about this.  It is a source of disappointment that because of the lack of confidence in the indigenous economy, this figure is much too high.  The Government's focus will continue to deal with young people and opportunities for them.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am raising the issue in an attempt to be constructive because the 30% youth unemployment figure is alarming.  We can take it for granted those young people will come from socially disadvantaged areas, not exclusively so but particularly so, and the social divide I mentioned earlier will widen and deepen.The Taoiseach cited the jobs action plan but that plan is 126 pages long.Tá mé ag caint leis an Taoiseach.  Leo, any chance?The plan mentions young people twice in 126 pages.  The Taoiseach recited some of the detail from the last European summit but there is only €10 billion in new money, the rest is money that already exists in structural funds and so on.  It is reckoned we will get €1.25 billion of that for this State.I keep coming back to this, and I know the Taoiseach dismisses what I say in this regard, but the Government has given €20 billion to the banks in the same period; that is the rub.  The sum total of the spend of all the enterprise agencies in this State amounts to €450 million, compared to €20 billion going into banks, while one third of our young people are unemployed with no prospects.  This will come back to haunt us.  Will the Taoiseach not consider putting forward a specific stimulus package for youth jobs and if he does, when will he bring it forward?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The Deputy should note that the European Council meeting last week discussed, agreed and decided on breaking a principle which applied for a long time in Europe which was to the detriment of our families, communities and people.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	147	Sinn Féin has been saying that since day one.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Just last week, Deputy Adams remarked that we should tell the EU to get lost and to keep its money.  The first line of the communiqué states that we affirm it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  That is a principle that was not accepted when this country got into trouble a number of years ago.  I am glad that decision has now been made and agreed.I also want the Deputy to understand this is not just €10 billion.  The conclusions state that the EIB's paid-in capital is to increase by €10 billion with the aim of strengthening its capital basis, allowing it to increase its lending capacity by €60 billion and, thus, to unlock €180 billion of additional investment, spread across the European Union, including in the most vulnerable countries.That is there for a specific reason.  Countries with a higher than average European rate of youth unemployment will be able to draw down more of this depending on the creativity and the range of what they offer.  It is not a case of the Government producing a specific proposal for youth unemployment, we have that across a range of areas and will continue to drive that with our colleagues in Europe based on the recognition of the decisions made last week that countries that are vulnerable deserve to have access to greater funds that are now available.  From that point of view I will be happy to have any constructive suggestions he has beyond what we have on the table in respect of young people and the opportunities for them to have work here.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I note what the Taoiseach said to Deputy Adams about the achievements in Europe last week and it would be appropriate if someone on this side of the House congratulated the Government on a seriously successful diplomatic mission.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	153	What the Taoiseach called a "seismic shift" certainly happened in Europe last week, not necessarily on the banking question, but there appears to have been a change in the balance of power in Europe because of an ambush of Mrs. Merkel by France, Italy and Spain late in the night.  I hope the Taoiseach was part of that ambush.  I do not expect him to take the credit for it but he was part of that mission to achieve the end of the Franco-German leadership and domination of Europe and I welcome that.I have a question, however, about the headline change that was made.  The headline change, which is dramatic, is that there was a breakthrough on the distinction between the sovereign and the banking debt.  It is important, however, to address the difference getting the banking monkey off our backs will make to the ordinary citizens of Ireland.  The Minister for Finance has already said it will make no difference to the next budget.  Will it make any difference and is there any comfort in this great diplomatic triumph, which it is, for the average person on the street, the small businessman mentioned by Deputy Martin or the unemployed about whom Deputy Adams spoke?  The Taoiseach can talk about the projects and project bonds, which are part of a different package, but can he explain to us how this big separation of the sovereign and the banking debt will make a difference to those who suffering under the current austerity?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	154	This is good news for people in the sense that those who spoke about the European Union and hope for people got a response from the European Council meeting last week.  It is not a case of anyone looking for credit.  I give great credit to the Irish people for their decision on the referendum, which was accepted and understood by all of the leaders of the 27 member states, not just the 17 members of the eurozone.  That was credit in the bank, to use a pun, for use at an opportune time.  The decision made by the Council through the process of the jobs and growth agenda, which crystallised around the election of President Hollande, the discussions on the EMU, and those arising on the conclusion of the Presidency of Denmark, set out a strategy and plan which offers consistency for people.  The discussion that took place in respect of the decision, which will lead to a permanent supervisory responsibility for the European Central Bank, was brought to light by the difficulties of a number of the bigger economies in Europe.The Minister for Finance is correct in the sense that the decision will not have an appreciable difference on one's contribution on a week-to-week basis to the budget for 2013.  We still have to deal with our public financial problem at home.  However, it is clear there is an opportunity for a beneficial impact on future budgets.  It is also accepted the markets are now factoring in what that means in their analysis of the euro and the yields for different countries.  I note the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is to hold an auction for short-term money on Thursday, which will be an indication in its own way.  Although we are in a programme, it will be putting a toe in the water, as it were.The troika is in this country for its seventh analysis and this country is again expected to measure up.  That is all part of the acceptance of this country as being a serious player, albeit with a serious problem.  In the conclusions of the Council meeting, the fact that this country was named specifically in the context of equality of treatment, breaks and reverses what applied previously, to which I referred last week, in terms of the principle of European direction.  The Council has accepted that European liability applied in the past whereby this country - the people, communities, taxpayers, workers and families - was required, as a consequence of that decision, to shoulder the entire burden.  The decision brings clarity and a degree of certainty, not for the forthcoming budget but for the future.I hope the economies of Europe will start to grow.  For an exporting nation such as this it would mean more jobs but also that Europe as a unit would be able to continue to buy on the global market, which impacts on the global economy.  The negotiations that will now be entered into are important, not for this budget but for the future.  People ask me what figure I am talking about.  I do not have any bottom line.  What I have is a top line.  The top line is the maximum benefit and the best result for the country and the people.  The process will start next Monday with the meeting of ECOFIN Ministers where this country will be represented by the Minister for Finance.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Could I take it from what the Taoiseach said that although there will not be any effects in this budget, there will be tangible effects in the next budget and the following one?  If that is the case, perhaps the Taoiseach could tell us where he will target those particular benefits and what area of the economy will take priority in the benefits which will come from this particular separation of the banks and the sovereign debt?The Taoiseach did not address the issue I raised about the change in the balance of power in Europe.  That is vital.  Could he comment on the fact that there was undoubtedly a change when France confronted Germany, eyeballed Mrs. Merkel and won?  Could he tell us what part he and this country played in that particular new division of power in Europe?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is wonderful to observe the commentators who comment and the speculation that goes on.  Clearly, those who might have had a different view a number of weeks and months ago now reflect because of the decision made by the European Council.   I note that Mr. Colm McCarthy said that this is not a diplomatic win, it is a financial win.  I agree with him on that.  I accept there is a different reflection around the table.  President Hollande made it perfectly clear before the election that, if elected, he would require a growth agenda.  The process of a European Council meeting is that nothing is agreed until all is agreed, and those segments of the discussion took place between 2.30 a.m. and 5 a.m. the following morning.  The concluding hours of the meeting were taken up with a meeting of the 17 eurozone countries.  From that perspective, the interest and understanding of France for what this country has done, both in terms of the decisions made and in the context of our people having given a clear verdict on the fiscal stability referendum, speaks for itself.  In my conversations with President Hollande both by telephone from Government Buildings and at the meetings we have attended, France has expressed a genuine interest in seeing this country make its way steadily through difficult economic circumstances to be the first to emerge from the bailout programme.I say to Deputy Ross, as someone who has a genuine interest in the matter, what we are doing, having opened a door of opportunity and potential, is to use it now in the best interests of the country.  Frankly, I am not interested in attempted point scoring or in those who say I should be looking for credit.  The people know.  Psychologically, there has been an important boost for this country and also for Portugal, Spain and Italy.  We should build on those opportunities because much of the information in respect of the troika and the assessment of the banks has already been factored in.  Ministers are dealing with the troika this week.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will start the process of making arrangements to implement the decision next Monday.  I hope that will follow through as quickly as possible, although the logistics will be detailed.  I hope clarity and decisiveness will be brought to the decision of the European Council before the end of the year.We are interested in hearing from any Member of the House who genuinely has a constructive suggestion to make about how we build on what has been achieved to reduce the burden on families, communities, workers and taxpayers.  The Government has a number of options open to it.  The process will begin on Monday and it will feed into the system.  The best result is the top line - the maximum result we can get for the country and the people.  I am sure Deputy Ross shares that view.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.My Department received a total of 120 freedom of information requests in the year from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012.  A total of 80 requests were granted or part-granted.  In 12 cases the Department held no records.  Six requests were refused and seven were withdrawn.  A total of 15 requests are currently being processed.  A total of 76 freedom of information requests were received by my Department from 1 January to 30 June 2012.  Of those, 45 were granted or part-granted.  In five cases the Department held no records.  Four requests were refused, seven were withdrawn and 15 are currently being processed.  To date, the Department has received €831 in search, retrieval and photocopying fees in respect of freedom of information requests made in 2012.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	158	We are still waiting for the Government's proposals on the production of legislation to reform and extend freedom of information legislation, a clear commitment given in the programme for Government which committed to restoring the Freedom of Information Act on the basis that it had been undermined by the previous Government, a dubious proposition.  When will this occur?  Alternatively, Deputy Sean Fleming is introducing a Fianna Fáil Bill to extend the legislation to the National Asset Management Agency, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other bodies.  That Bill which will be debated this Friday will address many of the concerns the Government held in opposition.  I invite the Taoiseach to support it in so far as it would meet the many concerns articulated by other Deputies.What was the basis for the six refusals and are they being appealed?  Despite the hue and cry about the Freedom of Information Act, the Taoiseach and the Government have relied on it a fair bit.  For example, I sought information from the Taoiseach in the House on the pension levy, but I needed to use freedom of information provisions.  I received the information months later.  It seemed to be a deliberate ploy to delay giving me the information.  I made a freedom of information request regarding the famous Van Rompuy compromise.  Despite the European Union not having a difficulty with my request, the Taoiseach's Department refused me access to the documentation.  I can list several examples of Deputies who needed to take the freedom of information route to access behind the scenes information.  Hence, 80 freedom of information requests were submitted.  Unfortunately, we are not getting answers through the parliamentary system and people are being economical with information.  There is an unhealthy reliance by the Government on the freedom of information system to delay providing information on important matters of public interest for Deputies and the public generally.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I do not know the reason for the refusal of the six requests, but I do not have any hand, act or part in dealing with freedom of information requests.  I will ask the section that deals with this issue - people do it in addition to their normal work - if there was a specific reason the six requests were not granted.  I do not know what they were about or whether personal information or information that might have been particular to the Department or the State was asked for.  I will have the Deputy's question referred to the freedom of information officer in the Department.  If there is a specific reason they were refused, I will have it forwarded to him.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	160	What about the utilisation of freedom of information legislation as a ploy to delay giving information to Deputies?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	161	No.  The vast majority of freedom of information requests are answered on time.The Deputy mentioned Deputy Sean Fleming.  I am aware of his Private Members' Bill which proposes to extend the remit of the Freedom of Information Act to include a number of other agencies.  Clearly, there are some considerations in that regard.  The Government has reflected on the issue and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will make an announcement shortly.  He is dealing with the broader remit of the Freedom of Information Act.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	162	It was mentioned in the reply that there had been 80 requests.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this?  The number and cost of freedom of information requests could be reduced if Ministers replied to parliamentary questions.  The pension levy is a classic illustration, in that a simple question on whether the Taoiseach had received advice could have been answered in the House.  However, he chose not to do so and we needed to go through the arduous freedom of information process to find out the answers.  Lo and behold, we found out that he had received plenty of advice from the Department of Social Protection and other Departments and agencies.  This cuts to the core of the lack of transparency.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	163	We need to have a discussion about this matter in the House when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform brings forward his memo on re-examining the Freedom of Information Act in general.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	165	For instance, individual letters are coming in with ten, 15 or 20 requests, which are treated as one request.  The impact of a letter with an individual request could be very significant in terms of the time taken to address it.  I would like to think that, in general, we give every Member of the House as much relevant information as is appropriate.

If the request is reasonable and the information is available - if it is not sensitive to the State or a person and can be given - the response should be reasonable and appropriate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Ministers refuse to do this.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	169	The Deputy mentioned the savings that could be made.  We will examine that matter in the context of what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is doing in respect of the Freedom of Information Act in general.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Why examine it?  The Government just does not do it.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Let us revert to the kernel of the issue.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged, the Government committed not just to restoring the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before it was, undoubtedly, undermined by the previous Administration but also to extending its remit to capture other public bodies, including the administrative side of the Garda Síochána.  What progress has been made in this regard?  The Taoiseach referred to the work of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but how stands the legislative process and the commitment to broadening the remit of the Act?  To what extent does the Taoiseach believe it should be broadened?  For example, should its provisions be applied to the Central Bank, the Financial Services Authority, NAMA and the NTMA?  Sinn Féin published a Bill on how the Act should apply to NAMA.  When will the Government's legislation be introduced?  I hope the former has a sense of urgency attached.  As the Act is restored and broadened, which public bodies does the Taoiseach believe should be covered by it?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I must remind Deputies that questions on the widening and deepening of freedom of information legislation should be directed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Taoiseach referred to it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I used to ask these questions when in opposition.  As I told Deputy Micheál Martin, there will be a Private Members' Bill before the House on Friday, to which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will respond.  He has done a great deal of work on the Freedom of Information Act generally and will outline his response in some detail.Most of the complaints received in respect of the Freedom of Information Act relate not to the processes by which information is obtained but to the restrictions that apply to the information that can be released.  That is why the Government undertook in the programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information Acts to what they were prior to 2003.  We intend to expand their remit to include additional public bodies.The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform deals with the general scheme.  This matter was discussed today by the Cabinet, but I will leave it to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to respond to Deputy Sean Fleming's Bill on Friday and take the discussion and strategy from there.  Suffice it to say, we intend to adhere to the commitment in the programme for Government to restoring the Acts to what they were prior to 2003 and extend them to include a number of other public bodies.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Taoiseach simply echoed what I had said.  I understand a commitment was given.  I also understand Deputy Brendan Howlin is the line Minister responsible in this respect.  I asked the Taoiseach about the public bodies he believed should be under the umbrella of the freedom of information legislation.I specifically mention the likes of the Central Bank, the financial services authority, NAMA and the National Treasury Management Agency because there has been a real and perceived lack of information and transparency with these key public institutions that were at the heart of very many decisions and the economic catastrophe that came to pass.  There is a sense, grounded in reality, that these institutions are somehow in the shade and outside the Freedom of Information Act.  I do not see any argument for maintaining that position.I appreciate that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will deal with the detail of this matter but I cannot see how the Taoiseach would not have a view.  What about bodies like the Central Bank, the financial services authority and NAMA?  Should those institutions fall within this remit and have the freedom of information process applied to them?  The Taoiseach should have a view and answer the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I speak from this position as Taoiseach and Head of Government and my personal views are completely irrelevant.  I speak from here about Cabinet responsibility and decisions, and in that sense it is my duty to let the Deputy know that the line Minister has done a great deal of work on this and will respond to the Private Members' Bill on Friday.  It is not a case of an individual Minister having a view about what may be included in expanding the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.  The Government will make a decision and explain it to the Deputy and everybody else when it is delivered by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.We intend to deliver on what is in the programme for Government and put these Acts back doing what they were supposed to prior to 2003.  The Act will also be extended to a number of other public bodies.  The Government will make a collective decision on the matter, so it is not a question of anybody's individual focus on an organisation or public body.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the National Security Committee, it would not be appropriate to disclose information about the dates of individual meetings or any of its proceedings.  The committee is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice and Equality, Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  It is concerned with ensuring the Government and I are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but does not involve operational security matters.  The committee meets as required and will continue to do so.  In addition to the meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments which might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I understand the committee, by its nature, discusses confidential matters.  I presume the committee still monitors dissident activity in the North and the Republic, especially given the arrests this morning.  Is there any evidence of increased dissident activity in this jurisdiction, particularly in the Border region?  I am endeavouring to ascertain if the committee is meeting more regularly, given the increased possibility of international threats arising from the upcoming Olympics in London this month.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether those issues have been a subject matter for discussion?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The matter has not been discussed at Government level but the Secretary General to the Government and the members of the committee keep in close liaison on a regular basis.  The committee meets as often as necessary.  With regard to dissident activity, it is fair to say the evidence of what has been happening over a period leads to an understanding that there must be heightened awareness and great collaboration between the Garda in this jurisdiction and the PSNI in Northern Ireland.  The relationship between the Ministers responsible for justice matters is very strong in that regard.  The Deputy may also be aware of activity by the Garda in thwarting a number of potential bomb threats and cases where bomb-making equipment has been discovered and confiscated.  The issue is of concern to us all and we have discussed this at the recent North-South Ministerial Council at Farmleigh.  As I mentioned, this committee meets as often as necessary, and the personnel involved keep in close contact.  It deals with matters of concern to everybody on this island.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.Expenditure on consultancy by my Department has greatly reduced in recent years.  Since 2008 there has been an 88% reduction on consultancy spend, and consultants are only engaged when necessary, with all guidelines in engagement of consultants adhered to.  In 2011 my Department engaged QTS Consulting to carry out a risk assessment and update the Department's 2011 health and safety statement at a cost of €1,271.The organisational review programme, ORP, which was mandated to examine the capabilities of the Civil Service to meet the challenges ahead and deliver focused public services into the future, finalised its review of my Department last year.  To assist in the preparation of my Department's action plan in response to the ORP report, Towers Watson Consultants was asked to facilitate a series of workshops with staff.  The use of consultants in facilitating the workshops helped to assure staff of confidentiality and the independence of their findings.  The total cost of the consultants was €12,100.  The total spend by my Department to date in 2012 on consultancy is €21,074.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Will the Taoiseach indicate that the experitse was not available in the human resources section of the Department to provide the seminars, in particular, and the workshops with staff, etc.?  Does the Taoiseach envisage that more companies will be recruited over the next year?  What will be the cost of same?  An important point has emerged in the utilisation of consultancy companies to legally evade taxation obligations in this country.  Apparently, this is now the case in the Department of Health, where two of the senior advisers on the team of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are, in essence, consultancies procured through arrangements and vehicles in the United Kingdom to evade legally any obligation to pay taxes in this jurisdiction.I respectfully suggest that this has serious implications for social solidarity when we are asking everybody in the health service and across the public and private sectors to bear the burden of taxation and additional charges.  It adds to cynicism and scepticism if this means of procurement and utilisation of consultancies by the Minister in particular and the Government in general is to be used.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider this seriously, as it has the capacity to undermine public confidence in administration and the manner in which the Government procures advisory services.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The number of consultants employed by the Department of the Taoiseach is kept to a minimum and when it happens, the process is strictly in accordance with guidelines and proper regulations.  QTS Consulting was engaged in 2010 following a competitive tender to carry out a risk assessment and review of the Department's health and safety statement, which is a requirement for all Departments.  Section 20 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires the Department to have in place a written safety statement based on the identification of hazards and risk assessments carried out in the workplace.  The reason is that while one may have competent internal personnel, in any Department having an objective outside independent view on the importance of a written statement on health and safety in the workplace is in the interests of all employees.  That was the reason a competitive tender was sought and the consultants were appointed.The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has employed several specialists on specific contracts because of their expertise.  The Deputy should raise the point with him about consultants being involved in tax evasion or making recommendations.  The subject requires a more detailed response in a Topical Issue Debate or to a priority question tabled to the Minister.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	183	It was tax avoidance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I imagine the Minister would be happy to respond in detail.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Will the Taoiseach give us the figures again?  He gave a total figure of €21,074, some €12,100 of which was attributable to the departmental action plan.  What did the health and safety review cost, that is, the work carried out by QTS?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	186	QTS carried out a risk assessment and updated the Department's health and safety statement at a cost of €1,271.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The figures are €1,271 and €12,100.  They do not come to €21,074.  There is obviously something missing from the Taoiseach's script.  I am trying to figure out the mathematics because I am puzzled.  The health and safety review cost €1,271.  Is that what the Taoiseach told me?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Yes, €1,271.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The departmental action plan cost €12,100.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	190	That is correct.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Taoiseach told us the overall spend was €21,074.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The total spend by the Department to date in 2012 on consultancy is €21,074.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The Taoiseach has only itemised spending on two contracts, which comes to approximately €13,000.  Clearly, there is something missing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The EU communications contract was given to a media and public affairs consultancy firm for 60 days to deal with the EU affairs and co-ordination division of the Department of the Taoiseach.  It was to assist in the development of a media and communications strategy in respect of Ireland's role in the European Union and to identify and advise on the media and communications challenges relating to the Union in a complex environment with increasing demands for public information.  The work also involved identifying concrete actions to deliver on priorities and develop an initial communications plan, including logistics, for Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers.  Following a competitive tendering process, a person was appointed on 28 March to provide EU communications advice.  She commenced work on that for 60 days.  The person concerned, Ms Erskine, has completed her work and finalised her duties.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Does that account for the difference in the figures?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I assume it does, but I do not have the figure before me.  As far as I know, there was no other consultancy contract.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying the matter.  In the case of QTS and the EU media consultancy contract, competitive tendering procedures were applied.  Is that equally true of Towers Watson and the work on the departmental action plan?  I am calling on the Taoiseach to confirm that all consultancy work is subject to the standard and required procurement procedure.  The media consultancy contract to assist the Department in communications on our position in the European Union and so on was for 60 days.  Did it coincide with the referendum period?  Will the Taoiseach clarify the matter?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	198	It was about the key message to be communicated during Ireland's Presidency of the European Council and associated preparations.  I confirm that the logistics and the preparations for Ministers for the Presidency are intense and will become even more so in the run-in from September.  It had nothing to do with the referendum issue but with preparing for the EU Presidency which we will assume on 1 January next year.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I am sorry for getting up and down, but I was keen to clarify those matters.  The Taoiseach was asked about the in-house expertise available and, no doubt, it is considerable within the Department.  I understand there are matters which of necessity require consultancy support and for which the Department must buy in skills.  It strikes me as rather odd, however, that the Taoiseach would need a media consultant to work with him on his political messages, to use his phrase, for the Presidency of the European Council.  As the Head of Government, he and his departmental staff should be more than well equipped to crunch down on these issues and decide on the messages they reckon it will be appropriate to communicate in that time.  Will he clarify the matter?  He has stated this work started on 28 March and that it was a 60 day contract.  I presume the work was finished in or around 28 May.  There was a referendum held on 31 May.  Will the Taoiseach be clear on the nature of that consultancy work?  I find it odd that he required it to be done, but nonetheless he has suggested it referred solely and exclusively to the upcoming European Council Presidency and that it had no bearing on the treaty referendum.  Will he tell the House off the top of his head, if possible, how much the Department spends per annum in dealing with European communications issues?  Is it common practice for the Department to bring in media advisers for his public enunciation of the European message.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Department of the Taoiseach only brought in personnel in the European section when the Government was formed last year.  There was a unit dealing with questions on the European Union but to streamlinee matters and to be more effective personnel dealing with European issues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade came to the Department of the Taoiseach.  There was a more hands-on approach as a result, with a specific Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs reporting both to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I cannot indicate what was spent in the past in dealing with European affairs isues by the Department of the Taoiseach, although I am sure that figure is available for the Deputy.  We try to keep costs to a minimum in the best way possible.The Deputy referred to the date of the referendum and the period for completion of the work by the advisory service.  I am sure that since the dates overlapped to an extent, there would have been some advisory work done in respect of the Government preparing for the referendum and the EU Presidency.  Things will overlap, although the remit was specifically the EU Presidency and what it meant for us.  It is fair to say the range of questions and requests for information to the Department is rather extensive.  The Deputy would be surprised by the range of questions and what people ask about the European Union and how the Government intends to deal with issues as we prepare for this, our seventh Presidency which we want to be as effective as possible.  Several matters may fall to be dealt with during the Irish EU Presidency.  I am glad the Danes concluded on the patent agreement, the work on which lasted for 30 years.  The multi-annual financial framework, which is the budget for the European Union from 2014 to 2020, may fall to be decided during the Irish Presidency.  One cannot reform the CAP without having in place a multi-annual financial framework.  That is of such importance to the Union, 80% of whose budget is related to the CAP, but also to this country in respect of the single farm payment and what it means for the agriculture sector and exports.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was in France with 35 companies during the week.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, was in the United States following through on clear opportunities.There is a need to update, in a complete fashion, the website on the Irish Presidency with a view to outlining what it means for Ireland and our relationship with our colleague countries in Europe.  That was also part of the work.  It is a matter of taking into account the fact that the Presidency offers an opportunity to send out a positive message about Ireland and how we are moving towards economic recovery, and about decisions that are being taken that affect our society and the Government's political vision on Ireland's place in the eurozone and European Union.  It is also a question of determining where the European Union should position itself globally.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain why he did not give a full answer at the outset.  He did not mention the media and public affairs consultancy in his initial reply to my question and that of Deputy Adams.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I gave the full amount.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The Taoiseach did not mention that a media and public affairs consultancy was used.  He mentioned QTS, the ORP and Towers Watson, but he did not mention the other company.  Is it in the official reply?  Will the Taoiseach undertake to forward to us the exact details of the consultancy contract given that they may not appear in the formal reply prepared for the question I tabled?  I do not know whether there was an attempt to hide the information.  In response to a supplementary question, the Taoiseach articulated the information to the House.  There may have been a genuine misunderstanding.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach, given the questions asked, to give the full answer.  For some reason, we-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Can the Taoiseach explain why he did not give the information?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	213	These are oral questions and the Minister or Taoiseach replies orally.  It is not a question of a written statement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I gave the official answer and I gave Deputy McDonald further information, which is in the official brief.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I asked the Taoiseach "if his Department has recruited any consultancy service in the past year; if so, in what area; and if he will make a statement on the matter".  In his answer, the Taoiseach, for some reason, excluded any mention of the EU media messaging consultancy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I said "only engaged when necessary, with all guidelines in relation to engagement with consultants"-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I am saying the Taoiseach excluded that information in the beginning.  There was an attempt not to mention it, although I do not know why.  The Taoiseach just did not mention it; it is not included in the answer.  We are, at least, entitled to receive answers to the questions we ask.  I hope there was not an attempt to bury the information because of the sensitivities associated with European issues and the referendum.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Questions Nos. 1 to 5 deal with the ORP report.  Questions Nos. 6 to 17 deal with the media and public affairs consultant and Question No. 18 deals with the health and safety statement.  When I finished at the end of page 2, I stated total expenditure by my Department to date in 2012 on consultancy is €21,074.Let me read the next three paragraphs, which state:This includes a payment of €19,803 to Ms Caroline Erskine, media and public affairs consultant who was engaged to provide an EU communications advisory service to my Department following a competitive tendering process.  This is a particularly intense period of EU-related activity for Ireland.   Preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers has intensified since the start of the year.  A major Government information campaign was also launched to inform the public ahead of the referendum on the stability treaty, which had not been foreseen at the start of the year.The Government is committed to building public understanding and knowledge about Ireland's EU membership.A payment of €1,271 was made to QTS who carried out a risk assessment and updated the Department's 2012 health and safety statement.I apologise again to the Members.  Page 3 got stuck to page 2 and, inadvertently, I did not read it out.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I accept the Taoiseach's apology.  I will now ask the supplementary question  I was to ask before the misunderstanding.  With regard to my question on the utilisation of consultancies to avoid paying tax, which avoidance is illegal in this country, I suggest that the matter be a broad Government policy issue.  The bottom line is that it appears that in the Ministry for Health and Department of Health, consultancies are now being used as a basis for hiring senior advisers to the Department, with companies located in the United Kingdom avoiding the payment of any income tax.  That is unacceptable.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable?  Will he, as Taoiseach, take up this issue with his Ministers?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I will take it up with the members of the Government.  I do not believe it is acceptable to have consultants involved in work if it has the effect described.  Obviously, in the financial world, people often prepare reports on how to lessen the impact of tax payment.  When the Deputy talks about tax evasion or avoidance, he should note these are other matters.  I will certainly raise the issue with the Minister for Finance.  There may be technical reasons requiring a response and I will revert to the Deputy.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The Taoiseach stated that EU consultancy work did pertain to preparation and advice in respect of the referendum.  He did not say that at the outset.  I am working on the broad supposition, probably incorrectly, that the use of public moneys for that was fully in accordance with the letter and spirit of the McKenna judgment.  The Taoiseach did not give a full answer although I acknowledge his pages stuck together.  His figures still do not add up, however, because his revised figures give him a total of more than €32,000, rather than €21,074, as first articulated.  I am more concerned about the fact that it is only in response to further questioning that the Taoiseach clarified the EU consultancy work was not simply about the Presidency, as he indicated at first, but also related to the referendum campaign.  The work was concluded on 28 May and the people went to the polls on 31 May.  The Taoiseach needs to clarify for the Dáil that the use of public moneys was in accordance with the McKenna judgment.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	262	To prepare discussions on the growth agenda for the European Council on 28 and 29 June, President Van Rompuy convened an informal dinner meeting on 23 May, which I attended, for an open exchange of views.  The Government has consistently argued that for Europe to move beyond its current difficulties, measures to ensure stability must be complemented and supported by an equal focus on the growth and jobs agenda.  Ireland has much to gain from this debate and we are playing a full and active part in it.  I set out my thinking on this when I spoke to President Van Rompuy by telephone ahead of the meeting.  As I have already made a statement to the House on the outcome of the 23 May meeting, I will merely give a summary of its findings.While we did not adopt any formal conclusions, there was sufficient consensus to enable President Van Rompuy to identify a number of key themes and issues for the discussion.  First, it was clear that all member states subscribed to the view that actions aimed at growth must complement rather than detract from efforts to ensure fiscal consolidation.  Second, the process of structural reform through the Europe 2020 process must continue.  Third, President Van Rompuy identified the following pillars of growth: mobilising EU policies to fully support growth, including making urgent progress on important legislative proposals such as the Single Market Act and the energy efficiency directive; stepping up our efforts to finance the economy through investments and better access to credit, especially for SMEs, including project bonds and increasing the capital of the European Investment Bank for financing projects; and job creation involving better synergy between European and national instruments, including Structural Funds, to combat youth unemployment in particular.  At the end of our meeting we also had a discussion on eurozone developments, including with regard to Greece and Spain.  There was strong support for Greece remaining a part of the eurozone and an equally strong wish to see it press ahead with implementation of its programme.I had no formal bilateral meetings while at the informal European Council meeting on 23 May.  With regard to my other recent bilateral contacts, I spoke by telephone to President Hollande on 9 May and congratulated him on his victory in the presidential elections in France.  Our discussion focused on the stability treaty referendum and the reorientation of the European agenda towards a strong growth future.  I also spoke to President Hollande on 1 June following the outcome of the stability treaty referendum.As the House will be aware, I met Prime Minister Cameron in London on 12 March.  In addition to our joint statement, we discussed a range of other issues over the course of our meeting, including the economy and Europe.  We are both firm supporters of the Single Market and will continue to consult each other on key EU policy issues.  We also discussed the most recent European Council and we strongly agreed that growth and jobs should remain at the centre of the EU's agenda.  We briefly discussed the financial transaction tax and I repeated the Government's clearly held position that it could not be allowed to introduce competitive distortions.  I updated Prime Minister Cameron on the stability treaty and on the referendum.  I explained our position regarding our efforts to reduce the costs to the State as a result of promissory notes.  I was pleased by his comments in support of our continuing efforts in pursuit of our economic recovery.  I also met him at the British-Irish Council summit in Edinburgh on Friday, 22 June.I spoke by telephone to Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Monti, Prime Minister Rajoy, President Van Rompuy and President Barroso on 1 June to convey the result of the referendum on the stability treaty.  I wrote to the new Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Antonis Samaras, to congratulate him on his success in the recent elections and to wish him and his new Government well in their endeavours.  In addition, I met all my European Council colleagues, including Prime Minister Juncker, President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, at the European Council Summit meeting in Brussels on 28 and 29 June.  As I will be making a full statement on the June European Council tomorrow, I will not go into detail now.Conclusions for the June European Council were prepared in the normal way and Ireland set out its views and proposed amendments in the usual manner.  Building on our work on 23 May, last week's meeting decided on a compact for growth and jobs, which is intended to provide a coherent framework for action at national, EU and euro area levels.  This is a very welcome development.  The Government has been actively working towards this for some time now.  The compact has the potential to boost investment in the Union by approximately €120 billion, or 1% of GNI.  This will be done through the mobilisation of the European Investment Bank, with €10 billion in extra capital, project bonds and the Structural Funds.  The Government succeeded in ensuring the investment will be available to all member states, regardless of size.The meeting also invited President Van Rompuy to develop further the ideas in his report, Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union.  This report set out the four essential building blocks for the future economic and monetary union, as follows: an integrated financial framework, an integrated budgetary framework, an integrated economic policy framework, and strengthened democratic legitimacy and accountability.  President Van Rompuy will now develop, in close collaboration with the President of the European Commission, the president of the eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank, a specific time-bound roadmap for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union.  He will examine what can be done within the current treaties and which measures would require treaty change.  Member states will be closely associated with and regularly consulted on these considerations.  An interim report will be presented at the October European Council and a final report will issue by the end of the year.Last week's European Council concluded the second European semester by endorsing country-specific recommendations.  Leaders also addressed the external aspects of the EU's economic policy and considered how the EU can deepen its trade and investment relationships with key partners.  In addition, the European Council also discussed the new multi-annual financial framework and took stock of progress in major justice and home affairs files, including Schengen governance and asylum, as well as nuclear energy, safety and security issues.  Consideration was also given to the evolving situation in Syria.A euro summit meeting took place after the discussion of 27 June on Thursday night into Friday morning.  The outcome of this meeting was of particular significance, with leaders of the euro area affirming that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, which is precisely what the Irish Government had sought going into the meeting.  Towards this end, euro area leaders agreed that work should be advanced urgently on a single supervisory mechanism for banks, following which the ESM could be enabled to directly recapitalise banks.  As Deputies will recall, this is something that the Government has sought for some time.  In a development of great significance for this country and its taxpayers, it was agreed that the eurogroup will now examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to improving further the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  This work will start at the eurogroup meeting next week.  Importantly, the principle that similar cases will be treated equally has been fully established and agreed.  This was a vindication of the approach the Government has taken to negotiating with partners on lessening the load on the Irish taxpayer resulting from banking, including that arising from the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, promissory note.  It reflects the urgency of the need to deal definitively with the link between banking and sovereign debt as set out in the letter I wrote to my European Council colleagues ahead of last week's meeting.  I am confident that what has now been agreed will be of significant benefit to Ireland and Irish taxpayers over the years to come.I have not yet finalised plans for foreign visits outside of the European Council for the rest of this year, although I will attend the European Council meetings on 18 and 19 October and 13 and 14 December.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It is ludicrous that we are taking Questions Nos. 1 to 65 together.  We should return to a position of having Taoiseach's questions on two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, as was the case until the Taoiseach arbitrarily decided to reduce the number to one day.On the summit meeting, I concur with the Taoiseach that the decision to break the link between the sovereign and bank debt is welcome, although much more remains to be revealed.  The devil will be in the detail or, as Colm McCarthy wrote this morning: "The devil is in the principles."  Clearly, the position in Italy and Spain is critical and Prime Minister Mario Monti basically had to cry halt.  He went into the summit meeting and called a halt to the Italian situation and received the backing of Prime Minister Rajoy.  In fairness to President Hollande, he supported both Prime Ministers.  The fundamental issue was the separation of sovereign and banking debt but, more than that, the need to take decisive action to save the euro.  From the Irish perspective, the latter is the most important outcome of the summit.  It is worth saving the euro.The Finnish and Dutch Governments have voiced concern about the element of the agreement which suggests the European Stability Mechanism may buy bonds on the secondary market.  Colm McCarthy notes that, in essence, this means the European Central Bank is being replaced with a buyer whose balance sheet constraint is known, which is a retrograde step.  The Dutch and Finns are not trying to be awkward or opposing the outcome of the summit but expressing legitimate and rational concerns that this may not be the best route forward.  While some useful decisions were taken, it is their view that the crisis will prevail until the central question is addressed, namely, how does one develop a lender of last resort - my party has consistently argued that the ECB should be the lender of last resort - in order that one has a mechanism, either the ECB or an agency thereof, that is decisive and can take action with conviction on the bond market.  That issue remains to be decided upon.  The ESM buying on the secondary market has not worked thus far and is unlikely to work in future given that it only has some €500 billion at its disposal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I do not agree that the devil is in the principle here.  The principle was very clear.  As Deputy Martin knows, the European Council discussed, decided, agreed and signed off on its conclusions.  The page in respect of the euro area summit statement is very clear: "We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns."  This principle, which had not been accepted before, has been agreed and decided.  As I stated, nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  In respect of the ESM, I note the comments of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, and the Finnish Prime Minister, Jyrki Katainen, both of whom spoke at the meeting in regard to their views on this matter.  However, this is what was agreed and signed off on.  We now have a great deal of work to do on the detail of working out the implementation of this principle, what that means in respect of the ESM and how it can be adapted here.

As we are in a programme, our country-specific recommendation is to continue with our programme.  That is the conditionality attached to us, with which we intend to deal.  The breaking of that principle is important for us.  The anxieties or concerns of the Dutch and Finnish Prime Ministers were expressed at the meeting but the meeting signed off on the-----

Spain's formal request under the ESF for €62 billion and a cushion of up to €100 billion for its banks clearly presents a challenge for Prime Minister Rajoy in respect of dealing with his country's deficit while borrowing at rates of almost 7%.  Prime Minister Monti discussed with me on the telephone last week before I went to the meeting the virtuous circle of which Italy is a member, given that it has to roll over €20 billion in loan repayments every month, which is an enormous challenge.  The meeting, in its discussions, decided that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.  The process of the meeting was to start with different segments, including the jobs and growth agenda, multi-annual financial frameworks and a report from Denmark, before moving into the discussions on the eurozone.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	269	We all accept that the decision to recognise the necessity to break the vicious cycle between banks and the sovereign is long overdue and very welcome.  I have a couple of questions on the turn of events which the Taoiseach described as "seismic".  Who wrote the reference to this State?  The view articulated in this reference is that there will be a review.  There is also an inference that while the level of debt is sustainable, sustainability needs to be improved, and it is asserted that the programme of adjustment is performing well, which will be news to people who are struggling under the agenda of cutbacks.  I find some of the language worrying and would like to know who wrote the reference and what collaborative process was involved.What does the decision to unhitch the burden of bank debt from the sovereign and people mean in respect of the promissory note and Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide?  The Minister for Finance has made clear it will not mean anything in respect of the next budget.  Much has been said about the stimulus package, investment in jobs and so forth.  The new money in the package amounts to only €10 billion.  With 25 million people unemployed across the European Union, €10 billion by any stretch is not seismic or earth-shattering.

Is it not also the case that when one examines the detail or lack thereof in the so-called breakthrough, there is good reason to believe it may be something of an accountancy trick, especially in light of the statement by the Minister for Finance immediately after the great declaration that there will not be any easing of the burden of austerity to be imposed on people this year?  Moreover, given that we own the banks, does shifting the burden from the sovereign to the banks not mean re-imposing it on citizens in another form?The European Stability Mechanism, the fund that is supposed to bail out the European banks, has a capacity of only €500 million and it is estimated that the hole in the Italian and Spanish banks alone is €2 trillion.  Does this not guarantee that Ireland will have to fork out the entire €11 billion called on this country under the ESM to bail out these banks?  We do not know the size of the hole in the rest of the banks.  One of the major problems in Europe and Ireland at present is the failure of the banks to lend and to put credit into the system.  Is it not the case that shifting this burden from one place on the accountancy balance sheet to another will simply mean those banks we have recapitalised will be even less likely to invest and lend into the economy-----

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I refer to the sentence, "The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme".  Apart from being a commendation of the savage austerity imposed by the troika, does this mild aspiration in any way justify the elation expressed by the Taoiseach following the summit meeting?  I appreciate the Taoiseach probably was seriously sleep-deprived and perhaps a little disorientated-----

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	276	-----but that elation was carried into the pages of much of the capitalist press.  What justification is there for such elation?  Will the Irish people as a whole be responsible for a euro less as a result of this sentence?  Second, on foot of this agreement, what will happen to the approximately €30 billion that has been put on the shoulders of the Irish people to salvage Anglo-Irish Bank ?  Will this €30 billion now come from the European Stability Mechanism, ESM?  Must someone pay back that to the ESM and, if so, is that the Irish people?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	277	On Deputy McDonald's question as to who wrote this, she will recall I wrote to all the leaders some weeks ago setting out the position.  Ireland was the first country to suggest the ESM should be licensed for direct injections into banks, an idea which then became common currency.  Before attending the meeting, I made clear there was a twin objective in this regard.  The first was to reach a conclusion on the growth agenda, which was highlighted by President Hollande during his election campaign, and which was agreed.  The second objective was there should be a response to the banking crisis with particular reference to the legacy debt problem faced by Irish families and communities.  In that regard, I refer to the acceptance of the principle about which I spoke last week in this Chamber, namely, if one had European direction and European liability, that needed a change in respect of what happened in Ireland where there was a direction with the liability being taken on by the Irish people and Irish families.I pay tribute to the group of officials from all the countries who reflected on the clarity of Ireland's case, which resulted in Ireland being one of only two countries mentioned in the euro area summit statement in order to avoid any opportunity for not understanding what this was.  Deputy McDonald was on a different side during the referendum campaign but I must tell her that the decision of the Irish people, in its clarity and decisiveness, certainly was credit in the bank for Ireland, to use a pun, with regard to the manner in which other leaders considered our problem and our country.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	280	So, Irish officials wrote the Irish reference.  That is what I was getting at.  I was not talking about the entire statement.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	283	My point is a group comes forward with agreed papers.  It is not a case of one person dictating what goes into it at a particular point.  These groups of officials present papers to leaders, who then decide on the principles and the detail eventually is worked out.  I note that before we ever got to that meeting, the Government had made it perfectly clear what was the Irish position.  As I told Deputy Martin in response to a question earlier, we seek a top line, rather than a bottom line, namely, the maximum benefit for the country.Deputy McDonald also mentions the promissory notes.  All that information and all the discussions that have taken place will now feed into the process which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will lead from next Monday, 9 July.  As the Deputy is aware, the last line of the statement states, "We task the Eurogroup to implement these decisions by 9 July 2012."  That is impossible and the process will start at that point.  However, I hope it can be concluded within a relatively short time.Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the ESM and the promissory notes, which feeds into that discussion.  There is a case before the courts at present in respect of the ESM and I do not wish to make any comment about its outcome because I understand the justice will give her decision before 9 July-----

Moreover, I might tell the Deputy the only evident elation was the buoyancy in the markets, which reflected the decision of the European Council and which is in Ireland's interest.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Would the Taoiseach care to discuss the €4.5 million Fine Gael received in public funding last year?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I hope such a progression will continue, whereby there has been a serious fall in interest rates for Ireland, as others consider us from abroad and conclude this is a country that is making steady progress in difficult conditions.  As the Deputy is aware, markets anticipate and feed into their investment decisions how they view countries in respect of political stability, in the context of the engines to drive their economies and the decisions that are being made.  Consequently, there was no disorientation.  Here was an understanding of a major decision made by Europe, which opens a door for this country on which I hope we can build.  If the Deputy has even a single constructive suggestion to make, I would be delighted to hear from him.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	290	For a start, I would not run to the sharks in the markets.

While proposals have been put forward in respect of seven directorates, they are just proposals at present and in the meantime, hospitals are finding it extremely difficult to pay their way.  Mr. Cathal Magee of the HSE has indicated that a deficit of €500 million is looming.  The situation is in crisis and is directionless.  As I noted earlier, it was reported last weekend that the Minister has hired, as part of his senior team, consultancies located elsewhere, which are paid by the taxpayer here but which have no obligation and which, by the manner and nature of the company formation, are not obliged to pay tax in Ireland.  I urge the Taoiseach to bring forward the health governance Bill before the summer recess as a matter of urgency.  I seek clarification on the governance issues now arising in respect of health-----

It signed off on its Standing Orders last January and I understand they cannot have a legal framework until a motion is brought before the Dáil.  When will this motion be forthcoming?  Will it be brought before the Dáil before the end of the session?

The debate on the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 has yet to begin on Committee Stage, while the Credit Union Bill 2012 was published a few weeks ago.  The Central Bank Bill will not be published until next year after these Bills have been dealt with.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy RóisIn Shortall, are considering the report with a view to bringing proposals to the Government.  It is exceptionally irresponsible for a group to link the payment of children's allowance with cheap alcohol.   I understand Centra has today ordered its retailers to withdraw the promotion.  The human cost of alcohol is enormous.  I attended a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee which was addressed by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health, Dr. Tony Holohan, who launched the national substance misuse strategy steering group report on 7 February.  Alcohol, among other things, was responsible for at least 88 deaths every month in 2008.  The death of one in four young men was estimated to be due to alcohol, which compares to one in 12 deaths due to cancer or one in 25 deaths due to cardiovascular disease.  Alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and incidents of deliberate self-harm and also increases the risk of acquiring more than 60 medical conditions such as cancer.  It is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals - 2,000 beds every night occupied by people loaded with alcohol - a quarter of injuries presenting to emergency departments and 7,866 attendances in 2010 of specialised addiction treatment centres.  These are enormously important figures.  There are recommendations from the steering group.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, are looking at the report and they will bring their proposals to Government shortly.Because all of these things are lumped together, I might just say in passing that the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Tusk, spoke to me at the conclusion of the meeting in Brussels the other day and complimented Ireland on the quality, friendliness and generosity of its supporters recently attending the matches as part of the European championships.  He came over to me directly and said to specifically convey this to the Irish people and the Irish supporters.

I welcome the fact that we have established the strategic investment fund but the programme for Government is explicit in stating that we will establish a strategic investment bank.  Is it still our intention to establish that bank and, if so, when can we expect the promised legislation in order to promote jobs and investment in the economy?

The detail of that has been published and I understand it is coming into the House on Thursday this week to start that process.  There are a number of other pressing pieces of legislation.  It depends on when the Deputy wants the House to rise for the summer.  The House has been sitting late now for quite a number of weeks and I would like to think we will continue that to get as much of this done as we can.  There are some serious Bills here.  The Whips' meeting could discuss the schedule.  I would like to get as much done as we can.  Clearly, in the interests of all those caught in negative equity and mortgage arrears, it is important to get through as much of the Personal Insolvency Bill on Second Stage as we can.  The Whip will outline both this week and next week how we can adhere to that schedule.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I thank the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, for coming to the House today as I know he is busy.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise what I believe is a very important issue - important for the citizens of this Republic, for the politics of this country and for democracy itself.  In recent weeks I had the opportunity to familiarise myself with some of the evidence proffered at the Leveson inquiry in London.  I could not but notice that, at the conclusion of each day's evidence, reference was made by a number of witnesses, especially those who were political participants, to the concentration of media ownership and the fact that an excessive concentration of media ownership was not a healthy development.  Plurality and diversity of ownership is an essential bulwark of democracy, as recognised by the advisory group on media mergers in recommendation No. 11 of its report.While recent events in Ireland have brought the matter to centre stage, I am not personally motivated by the fact that ownership of Independent News and Media might transfer from one oligarch to another.  However, I am deeply concerned by the fact that, as a result of developments in this area, an undue concentration of media ownership in all its various manifestations and diversity in the hands of a particular individual, corporation or undertaking, and control by a particular individual, can arise.  The fact the Competition Authority would be concerned with the effect of such a development on the advertising market but would have little or no dealings with regard to media plurality is a cause for concern in the current legal situation.I cannot but be extremely disappointed at the slowness of progress, amounting to what I term clear and unnecessary foot-dragging on behalf of the previous Government, and now this Government, in implementing the concise recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers.  Its report was completed in June 2008, under the chairmanship of Mr. Paul Sreenan, SC, and was clearly available to the then Government, notwithstanding that the report was not published until 2009.I say to the Minister that we do not need any more excuses or side-stepping.  If there is a particular problem blocking the progress of this important legislation, he should deal with it.  I understand the cohort of legislative proposals dealing with media mergers is contained within the consumer and competition Bill and, indeed, I further recall that the go-ahead for the heads of the Bill was given at Cabinet last July, almost 12 months ago.  The consumer and competition Bill is clearly Deputy Bruton's responsibility as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  He should get a move on.  If there are issues holding up progress, he should extract from the consumer and competition Bill the legislative proposals dealing with media mergers, which are stand-alone provisions in any event and could be incorporated into a short Bill, which could then be introduced onto the floor of the Oireachtas next week by the Minister who has responsibility for same, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Let us get on with the important and urgent business of putting vital legislation on the Statute Book.The advisory group on media mergers produced an excellent report which set out what needed to be done to protect Irish society against an undue concentration of media ownership and how this could be properly regulated in the public interest.  We must recognise, as pointed out by the report, the important role played by the media in a democracy, how this should be recognised by statute and what is required to ensure actual diversity of both content and ownership.  The report was concise in identifying the fact there is a lack of clarity in respect of the relevant criteria for media mergers as currently defined, and a glaring absence of clear statutory mechanisms to protect the public interest in media plurality.Legislation will have to deal with the definition of media business, which should now clearly encompass the Internet and all other such forms of communication which are now of such major importance in terms of the dissemination of information and influence on public debate.  The advisory group also dealt with the role of the Competition Authority and, in particular, advocated a reduced role for the authority in assessing the plurality aspects of media mergers.  A further recommendation focused upon the introduction of a statutory test to help guide the Minister in making decisions, which I welcome as being extremely important.As I understand it, this legislation was expected to be published earlier this year.  I would like to know what has caused the proposed legislation to lose its place on the list, especially when it would have a clear objective of ensuring the continuing existence of an active and diverse media sector in terms of both ownership and content.  Chapter 8, which contains the recommendations, represents the fulcrum of the changes that are urgently required and the Sreenan principles clearly acknowledge the importance of the plurality of the media and what it would contain.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this issue.  I assure him there is no intent on my part to delay this in any way.  In fact, as he rightly said, I went to Government in July last year to bring forward proposals.  That legislation contains not just the media merger proposals but also contains two important programme for Government commitments, the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and the introduction of measures to deal with unfair trading in the grocery sector.I would like to give the Deputy some assurance that while, clearly, the system needs to be improved and we are setting about improving the criteria to implement those changes the Deputy set out, there are already clear criteria in the legislation.  Under section 23 of the Competition Act the Minister has powers to consider a public interest determination around issues such as diversity of ownership.  The list includes the strength and competition of indigenous media, the spread of ownership, ownership concentration among individuals and among corporates, cross-media ownership, the scope for diversity of views, market share and so on.  I assure the Deputy strong criteria are in place to deal with a media merger should it come to my attention.  There will also be powers to consult more widely than is set out in existing legislation.  As Minister, I have the discretion to consult and impose conditions or otherwise.There is no doubt the new criteria set out by the review group are crisper and include a more structured consultation being required of the Minister.  It is my intention to have a proper consultation process in place as I recognise the need for it in such an area.  If there are applications for a media merger, there should be a process to allow people express their views.The powers to deal with this area will be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, a decision which had not been made before I assumed my role.  We have made that decision and agreed to that transfer.  The reason for the delay in drafting the legislation is due to other priority legislative measures which I am introducing in the House.  There is a full programme of legislation.  For instance, I have introduced legislation to reinforce the joint labour committee system, which was struck down by the High Court, to honour the troika agreement, on microfinance, the transfer of agency workers and the loan guarantee scheme.The Government approved the heads of the Bill to deal with media mergers which include the recommendations from the advisory group.  I am keen to push this ahead and keep this legislation as a single unit.  I have spoken to the Attorney General and it will get priority drafting.  Best regulatory practice says that one should keep a consolidated approach to legislation and not extract one piece from the rest.  Accordingly, I got approval from the Government for such an approach.  There is a process in train for the drafting of that legislation.  It is my intent to proceed with all possible haste to be in a position to introduce the legislation to the House, have it debated and passed.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Recommendation No. 2 of the Sreenan commission on media mergers stated the Competition Act should be amended to incorporate a statutory definition of the test for the public interest.  That would be important in helping the Minister to discharge his or her functions.  It recognises by implication the influence media has to play in a democracy where it can have a wide sphere of influence.  Will the Minister agree it is important the legislation is published soon in order that everyone, including media companies, can have full clarity of the procedures involved?  What would be the relevant criteria, set out in recommendation No. 3, that would underpin the public interest?I support the criteria set out by the advisory group that it is undesirable to allow any one individual or undertaking to hold significant influence in a sector or across different sectors of media business in the State.  Such an approach will necessitate the promotion of plurality in media businesses in the State.Recently, I read a Sunday Independent article by Darragh McDowell on Gina Rinehart, the richest woman in the world who accumulated her person wealth from mining and who, overnight, increased her stake in the Australian company, Fairfax Media, from 12.5% to 19%.  She now demands three seats on the board, the right to hire or fire editors of Fairfax titles while refusing to endorse the group’s principles on editorial independence.  This is in Australia and I am aware Ireland is small with a population of 4.5 million people.   However, this is what can happen in media ownership.  Will the Minister ensure this legislation gets priority in the autumn session and is introduced in one unit?  If there is foot dragging or another hiccup with the legislation, will he sever the element that deals with media mergers and introduce it is a self-contained Bill to the House to ensure it is on the Statute Book as soon as possible?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I support the recommendations set out by the advisory group.  In the interim, between now and the enactment of new legislation, there are already strong protective provisions in place.  I do have the power to block or impose conditions on a media merger on the grounds of it conspiring against diversity, plurality, mixed ownership and so on.  I also have the power to consult a broad range of interests on a merger.  The new legislation will make such consultation obligatory and will be permanent, more transparent and a better arrangement.  There is no intention of foot dragging with the legislation.  The approach I am taking is in accordance with a decision by the Government and a commitment in the programme for Government to implement several elements of competition law which will be enshrined in this Bill.  I am determined to push ahead as quickly as I can with this legislation and enact it as has been set out.  I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this important issue.  I am confident the existing system to deal with media mergers is robust but that the new system will be better designed.  I am also confident we will proceed to the implementation of this as quickly as possible.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to the House.  As he is aware, in the early hours of last Thursday morning the village of Douglas, Cork, was devastated by uncharacteristic flooding.  In the area around St. Columba's Terrace and St. Patrick's Terrace, a nice row of houses and a new shopping centre were submerged in water and destroyed.My main question is about a culvert in Douglas village put in place last summer by Cork County Council at significant cost.  Did the culvert work?  If it did, why was there flooding?  If it did not work, why?  Should the culvert's grate be moved?  Is there a need for a hydraulic lift to be put in place on the gate?  Many questions arise over this culvert as water overflowed from it and caused devastation.  This has become a significant issue to residents and local businesspeople in Douglas.  I visited residents in St. Columba's Terrace who have lived there all their lives and never experienced such flooding.  It is not about the amount of water that fell; it is about the devastation and cause.  An explanation needs to be given by Cork County Council as to what happened with this culvert and its operation.It is equally important the insurance industry works with small enterprises based in the new Douglas shopping centre.  They are already paying high rents and are struggling to keep going.  Both home owners and business people need answers.  I know the Government has not been found wanting so far.  However, the long-term issue in this case is the role played by a culvert in the recent flooding in Douglas village.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and acknowledge the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in the House.  As Deputy Buttimer outlined, people in several parts of Cork woke up last Thursday morning to devastation caused by floods.  Flooding occurred in Douglas, Togher, the Kinsale Road, Blackpool, Ballyvolane and Clonakilty in west Cork.  The Minister knows the heartbreak it causes for people when their homes are damaged and personal belongings that can never be replaced are lost forever due to flooding.  Many businesses, particularly those in the retail trade, were affected by this recent flooding when they are already struggling.  Some cannot even get insurance and now face possible closure as a result of these recent events.The wider community was also affected.  For example, Togher community centre was destroyed.  A major clean-up is in operation so it can be opened as quickly as possible.  Does the Government intend to make any practical assistance available to those affected by last Thursday's floods?  When a serious flood event occurred in Dublin last year, a €10 million assistance fund was established for home owners whose properties were affected.  Does the Government have plans to bring forward a similar measure in order to assist the people of Cork who were so badly affected by the floods on Thursday morning last?Deputy Jerry Buttimer referred to the culvert in Douglas which was only completed in the past 12 months.  The county councillors who represent the area were informed that it had been designed to withstand a one in 1,000 year event.  Such an event has taken place in the first of those 1,000 years.  It is clear that the culvert failed the first test mother nature visited upon it and that the people affected must live with the consequences.  There are questions which must be answered about the culvert and the value for money aspect.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	352	On behalf of the Government, I thank Deputies Jerry Buttimer and Michael McGrath for raising this matter in order that I might address a number of points on the difficulties the people of Cork city and county experienced in the past week as a result of flooding.  While, thankfully, no lives were lost, the flooding has impacted on homes and businesses in various areas.  I agree that this has been an awful and devastating experience for the people concerned.Met Éireann issued a severe weather warning at 4.54 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 June in respect of torrential and, possibly, thundery downpours during the period from 11 p.m. on that date to noon on 28 June.  As predicted, there was heavy rainfall across the country.  This spread from the south west and travelled in a north-easterly direction.  A number of localised downpours occurred, particularly in several areas of Cork.  Given their nature, it is not possible to predict accurately the exact location, scale or intensity of such downpours.  An aggravating factor was the fact that the ground was already saturated as a result of the wettest June on record.On foot of the weather warning to which I refer, Cork City Council and Cork County Council prepared by deploying outdoor staff to check drainage systems were clear; mobilising engineering staff to monitor rainfall and river levels; contacting the other principal response agencies, namely, An Garda Síochána and the HSE, to prepare for a co-ordinated response; and putting senior management on stand-by for crisis management roles.  I listened carefully to what the Deputies said about the culvert in Douglas and intend to have the matter investigated.  Information on that investigation will form part of the report I have requested from the city and county councils.  Clonakilty, Douglas, Glanmire, Blackpool and Ballyvolane were particularly affected by the flooding.  Road access to and from Clonakilty and Douglas was severely impacted upon and a number of roads were impassable.  Flooding of ESB sub-stations left approximately 10,000 homes and businesses without power.  Rivers burst their banks at Clonakilty and Douglas, causing severe flooding.As the rainfall worsened Cork County Council's crisis management team activated its flood response plan at 4.10 a.m. on 28 June.  Local authority fire services, engineering and outdoor staff were fully deployed to assist those worst affected.  Civil Defence and other voluntary services were mobilised to assist and inter-agency co-ordination arrangements were formalised with An Garda Síochána and the HSE.  In the light of the deteriorating situation, Cork County Council declared a major emergency at 6 a.m. on 28 June.  This joined-up response involved communication and public information; prioritising resources to the worst affected areas; traffic management; rescue and evacuation; and pumping water in order to clear roads and protect infrastructure and property.The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was notified of the situation in Cork shortly after 6 a.m. on Thursday last.  As the extent of the impact of the rainfall elsewhere was unknown and because there were reports of significant power outages, it was decided to convene a meeting of the flooding national co-ordination group for 9.30 a.m.  The group met again at 2.30 p.m. when it was decided to stand down because there were no major impacts outside Cork and the situation in the county was being effectively managed by Cork County Council and Cork City Council.  The Cork major emergency plan was stood down at 6 p.m. on 28 June.Specific recovery actions undertaken and still, to some extent, under way are working with local communities to clean up areas affected - I express my gratitude to local people in places such as Clonakilty because the clean-up to which I refer would not be possible without them - provision of skips to assist businesses and residents and opening recycling depots free of charge for those affected.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection is actively involved, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, in assisting those families and individuals affected by the flooding.  The scheme in question provides for exceptional needs payments to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which people could not be expected to meet from their weekly incomes.  Furthermore, there is provision for assistance in the form of urgent needs payments.  In certain circumstances, these payments can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is in contact with Cork City Council and Cork County Council in the context of assisting with road restoration, the rebuilding of walls which may have collapsed and the making of repairs to other items of infrastructure damaged by flooding.  The Office of Public works is carrying out a catchment flood risk assessment study of the south-west river basin district area which includes County Cork.  This will produce a prioritised list of measures to address areas of significant flood risk and assign responsibility for their implementation.  The study will also incorporate the recommendations of a pilot study already completed by the OPW on the River Lee catchment.The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering ways in which we can assist the Red Cross in the provision of humanitarian assistance.  They have also asked the financial institutions to help, if at all possible, the small number of businesses which have been affected, particularly those with no insurance.  Local authorities' budgeting does not provide for costs they incur when responding to unforeseeable emergencies.  The costs incurred by Cork County Council, Cork City Council and Clonakilty Town Council during and following the flooding last week are being assessed.  I will be considering the position in this regard with relevant Government colleagues as quickly as possible.  When all details and analyses of the flooding event that occurred in Cork last week are to hand in the coming days, a detailed report will be prepared for the Government task force on emergency planning in order that we can make a contribution to improving our resilience to deal with severe weather events of the kind witnessed last week.  I will report to the Deputies in due course on the financial assistance which can, notwithstanding the fiscal constraints on the Government, be provided for the local authorities in question.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I allowed the Minister to overrun on the time allowed because this is an important issue.  As a result, I ask Deputies Jerry Buttimer and Michael McGrath to pose brief supplementary questions.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	354	A fundamental question with which I hope the Minister's officials will deal is whether the flood water actually got into the culvert.  I have been informed by residents - I have also been shown evidence to this effect - that this did not happen.  The position on the community centre in Togher must be examined, particularly in the light of its proximity to the Tramore river.  Insurance companies must be called to task and be made to work with and assist residents and business people in the affected areas.  In some instances, these companies have been less than co-operative or helpful.  As the Minister is aware, a number of them have still not paid out in respect of the damage caused by the flooding which occurred in the Middle Parish area of Cork in 2010.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The Minister referred to the provision of financial assistance for local authorities.  Such assistance is important, but what about helping the people who were affected by the floods?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	356	Assistance is being provided for them by the Department of Social Protection via community welfare officers.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Minister ignored the question I asked with regard to whether a fund would be put in place to provide practical assistance for those affected.  It is not sufficient to merely point to the services on offer from community welfare officers and the Department of Social Protection.  When a similar flooding incident occurred in Dublin last year, a special humanitarian assistance fund of €10 million was established.  What is different about the people of Cork that they do not deserve similar treatment from the Government?  It would be very helpful if the Minister could address this point.I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work of local council staff in Cork who did their very best.  However, they were overwhelmed because the damage had already been done.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I am sure Deputy Michael McGrath will agree that I must wait until I receive a full evaluation from the local authorities concerned before deciding on the amount of money that will be needed.  I do not want to allocate funds which may not be required.  I want to obtain a full report in the first instance.  As stated, the Department of Social Protection - through the community welfare officers - is, in an exceptional way, providing assistance.  The Red Cross will, I expect, be receiving additional funds from the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in order that they might provide help on a humanitarian basis.  It is not yet possible to quantify the response that will be required from a financial point of view.  However, assistance is being provided for those who need it.We cannot always beat the weather.  Nobody ever expects 70 millimetres of water to fall in the course of three hours.  However, we must be resilient and ensure we help people to deal with the difficulties.  Regardless of whether it is the effectiveness of culverts, matters affecting Togher or issues relating to the insurance industry or those who have no insurance, we will see what we can do to assist.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter, relating to a national school in Emly, County Tipperary, which was given a grant of €100,000 for the construction of an additional classroom.  The site is classified as a protected structure and, as a result, it must comply with a number of local and national planning regulations before planning permission will be granted.  The office of the Minister is aware of the finer details of the case but, for the sake of the House, I will list some of the difficulties that arose when the school submitted its planning application.  Some of the restrictions placed on the school mean it must extend the existing roof to mirror the far side of the building, despite the fact this is not structurally necessary.  The school has been forced to clad the entire extension in expensive stone and limestone, in keeping with the pre-1960s structure.  The school has been forced to install cast-iron rainwater gullies to match those of existing buildings.  All of these requirements have affected the cost and size of the proposed extension outside the control of the board of management.  That means it has not been possible for the school to deliver the required classroom within the budget allocated by the Department.  In one of the most recent items of correspondence from the Department, officials in the planning and building unit are satisfied the grant approved is sufficient to provide the approved level of accommodation.  I am curious to see if the estimates include the additional costs associated with the extra planning restrictions.Under the initial application, it is my understanding that the school changed the scope of the work for which funding had been improved.  However, the school and the engineers in question have made a number of compromises in recent months in an attempt to reduce the costs involved.  They are still some way from the delivery of the project on budget.  I understand funds for projects such as this are limited but I am adamant that Emly national school stands alone in making this case.  I understand what the planning authorities are trying to do but more money is needed.  Some compromise could be made with the board of management and it is extremely unfair that the Department does not extend a one-off provision in respect of the school.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the allocation of funding for Emly national school, County Tipperary.  I am also aware that the Deputy has raised this matter with the Minister's advisers on a number of occasions.In July 2010, following an application by the school authority, Emly national school was approved funding of €100,000 under the additional accommodation scheme to provide an 80 sq. m permanent mainstream classroom to the school.  It is a central tenet of the scheme that responsibility for the management of a project, including cost control, rests with the school authority.  The conditions of this approved funding were set out to the school in a letter of 6 July 2010, which explained that any works carried out over and above the level of grant aid approved must be borne by the school authority.In March 2011, the school authority wrote to the Department of Education and Skills requesting additional funding of more than €124,000 in addition to the original funding approved of €100,000.  This would bring the costs of building one mainstream classroom to more than €224,000.  This is well in excess of the normal basic building costs of €100,000 for a single classroom extension.  The school explained that the additional funding was as a result of planning conditions imposed on the building project, including conditions associated with the fact that the school is a listed building and required cladding to the front and side elevation of the extension.  A thorough examination of a project with cost increases of this magnitude is essential to the efficient and effective administration of funding under this scheme.  Officials in the Department's planning and building unit undertook such an examination and it was discovered that the school had significantly increased the scope of works to that which was originally approved.  The scope of works approved had been increased to a classroom of 104 sq. m, instead of 80 sq. m agreed, a disabled toilet, a staffroom and extensive circulation space.  An assessment of the case indicated that even with the planning conditions imposed, the likely extension costs including planning requirements, could be achieved within the original grant of €100,000.  In July 2011, the school authorities were notified that the application for additional funding was unsuccessful.  The school authorities were informed of the reasons for the refusal and that it was open to the school to reduce the scope of works to stay within the grant allocated.I am sure the Deputy appreciates there are many competing demands on the Department of Education and Skills capital resources and in this context it must prioritise applications for the provision of much needed additional mainstream classroom accommodation.  A total of €357 million will be spent under the Department's school building programme this year alone.  In the current economic climate, it is essential that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure that value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.  In this way, we can ensure completion of the maximum number of projects from within the funds available to the Minister for Education and Skills for the school building programme.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.

It is simply wrong to make that point about the size of the school and the extra accommodation.  The Department official who wrote this response should be ashamed of himself or herself.  I met officials from the Minister's office and it was agreed with the school to build the school needed under the criteria of the allocation.  The problem is the extra features imposed by the council.  That is what is costing the money.  It is unfair to say the extension is bigger than the normal size.  That is not right and I cannot accept it.  I defy departmental officials to come to the school in Emly in the coming weeks as a matter of urgency.  I do not want to use the word lies but blatant untruths have been told to me in respect of the information available to the Department.  I know the Minister is not responsible but I ask him to explain what I have said to the Minister for Education and Skills and to ask the officials to come to Emily to see the difficulties on the ground.  The people of this village are being disenfranchised through the total neglect of the school by the Department.  It is time the Department copped itself on.

At the invitation of the Save Navan Hospital campaign, he addressed the 10,000 strong crowd who attended the public rally and said there would be no further cuts that would put people's health and lives in danger.  Fine Gael candidates in the constituency stood on the election promise that they would ensure a new regional hospital would be built in County Meath within the lifetime of this Dáil.The Minister is aware of the trolley count in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  It is disastrous, one of the highest in the State.  Work has been carried out under his direction to ameliorate the problem to a certain extent.  We appreciate this, but the figures are still stubbornly high.  In the first six months of 2010, 1,664 patients were forced to wait on trolleys.  In the first six months of 2011, 3,266 were forced to wait on trolleys.  The INMO has stated that from January to April this year 2,422 patients were treated on trolleys in Drogheda.  On each of these occasions little is offered to the patient in terms of privacy and dignity and the treatment provided is seriously sub-optimal.  I am not trying to draw a direct comparison with the shocking situation in Tallaght, but this makes people cautious about allowing trolley counts to remain so high.I bring to the attention of the House what happened in Cavan when the accident and emergency department in Monaghan was closed.  The trolley count rose from 746 in the first six months of 2009 to 1,443 in 2010 and 2,745 in the six months of 2011.  The increase was due to the closure of the accident and emergency department in Monaghan.  In the last few weeks a document was leaked from the HSE which, in fairness to it, indicated that it reflected its current objectives.  It does not hide behind the rhetoric of the previous Government in any way.  The document is entitled, The Louth and Meath Hospital Group Cost Containment Draft Project Plan, and details the closure of the accident and emergency department in Navan, the reduction of three locum consultant positions, the extended closure of orthopaedic services and the reduction of surgical in-patient activity.  These closures will occur despite shockingly high orthopaedic and surgical waiting times.  The savings that will be achieved in the part-closure of the accident and emergency department in Navan will total €800,000, but this figure does not take into consideration the cost of treating patients in other accident and emergency departments or the cost of transport.I appreciate that the Minister has taken a different attitude towards the health service in the Louth-Meath area and the change of direction since the term of office of the last Minister.  I also recognise the work done by Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies in County Meath in partnership with the hospital campaign in the last year.  I respect that work, but crunch time is coming for the hospital.  It is now or never; we must live up to the promises made and translate them into action.  Will the Minister commit to maintaining services at the accident and emergency department in Navan hospital?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I remember the meetings to which the Deputy refers.  I certainly know that at no time did I promise to keep the accident and emergency department in Navan open indefinitely.  I have made it clear, however, since becoming Minister for Health, that with accident and emergency departments in Cavan, Navan and Blanchardstown, all on the M3, and another in Drogheda, in the longer term the position at the accident and emergency department in Navan must be reviewed.  As the Deputy rightly points out, in the current situation where there is such a capacity issue, there is no question of a reduction in the service provided in the accident and emergency department in Navan hospital.I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the accident and emergency services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  Staff ensure patients are treated in a dignified and respectful manner, even when they might have to wait for treatment or admission.The Government is committed to securing and developing smaller hospitals to provide more services, not fewer.  However, these services, including emergency care, must be right and safely delivered.  HIQA has pointed to the type of patient who can be safely treated in different hospitals, depending, in particular, on the volumes of patients seen with each condition.  Smaller hospitals treat only small numbers of patients with complex or acutely life-threatening conditions in scheduled and emergency care.  This means clinical staff do not treat certain conditions frequently enough to ensure their skill levels.  These patients may also require specialised resources, including advanced life-support machines and complex surgical facilities which it is not feasible to provide in many small hospitals.  Accordingly, for certain conditions, small hospitals cannot ensure the best care and patients need to be directed to the care pathway appropriate to their needs.The HSE clinical programmes delineate acute hospital services, based on the safe provision of patient care for given facilities, staff resources and local factors.  Under this framework, the future growth in health care for local populations is firmly in local hospitals for ambulatory care, diagnostics and rehabilitation and with close links with primary health care.  Suitable services for expansion in smaller hospitals include minor injury units and urgent care centres; day surgery, including cataracts, hernia and other surgery safe for day provision; ambulatory care, including chronic disease management and assessment for older persons; medical services, including cardiac failure clinics, cardiac rehabilitation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outreach clinics; rheumatology, dermatology, diabetic day centres and rehabilitation; and diagnostics, including blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and bronchoscopy.The HSE is reviewing all services against its cost containment plans and a number of proposals are being considered for Navan.  The HSE is focusing on improving accident and emergency department and related services at Drogheda.  The HSE has been engaging with Navan Hospital Alliance and will continue to do so.  Under the public service agreement, there will also be engagement with staff and staff representatives.  However, the HSE has informed my Department that there will be no significant service changes in Navan or Dundalk pending the outcome of the discussions.  We must ensure hospitals deliver on the SDU's access requirements, within Government budgets and HIQA's safety and quality requirements.  The best way forward for smaller hospitals is to operate initially within hospital groups and ultimately within the proposed independent hospital trusts.  Consultations on these groups will commence this week with hospitals and other key stakeholders.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Central to the reconfiguration process that was signed up to by health professionals in the north east was the building of a new regional hospital, but this has not materialised.  I hear much good medical advice to say there must be a certain through-put for procedures to be clinically safe, but I cannot find any medical professional who will say reducing services in existing hospitals whereby patients will not receive a service because of waiting lists or be seen promptly and will have to spend a long time on a trolley is sufficient.  We are told we will create a new medical order whereby there will be an increase in medical procedure numbers leading to better outcomes, but the elephant in the room is that individuals are not given the option to avail of improved clinical procedures, rather they face longer waiting lists and longer waiting times on trolleys.  The Minister mentioned there would be no significant reduction in services.Does that mean there will be overnight or part closure of the emergency department until the necessary capacity exists?  Those of us involved in the hospital campaign are strongly of the view that we will fight for the emergency department until such time as there is a new regional hospital.  We look forward to working in partnership with the Minister in the future.  We might not agree on everything but there is no doubt we hope to work in partnership with the Minister in the next year or so to achieve some of our shared objectives.At a meeting of the hospital campaign last Wednesday many individuals there related their personal experience of arriving in the accident and emergency unit in Navan and their lives being saved or at the very least their health being repaired by the existence of the unit.  The hundreds and thousands of personal stories must be remembered on these occasions.  As a result of the personal experiences that were related, it was stated at the meeting that people would do their utmost, including mobilisation if necessary, but we hope that time will not come and that we can work in partnership with the Minister.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I hope the Acting Chairman will allow me some latitude.  I wish to put on record and to say to those watching the debate on the Internet or who will see it later that the trolley count for the first five and half months of this year is 20% lower than for the same period in the previous year.  That is despite taking €1.75 billion out of the health budget, 6,000 staff leaving the service since last year and 4,500 staff being redeployed.  It is also despite a 6% increase in admissions through emergency departments and a 7% increase in admissions overall.There was no commitment by me, when I was spokesperson, to a new hospital in the north east.  Approximately 48,500 people were on trolleys for the first five and a half months of last year.  The figure has fallen to 38,000 this year.  I accept that there are still too many people on trolleys.  We continue to work hard to move to a nine hour period from admission to a unit to either discharge or admission to a ward.  We are also working towards a maximum waiting time for treatment of nine months.  I am sure Deputy Tóibín agrees that the person who is waiting the longest should be treated first once urgent cases and those with cancer have been looked after.  When we came into power, more than 3,800 patients has been waiting more than a year for treatment.  When I last checked there were approximately 102.  I might be slightly incorrect in the figures but it is no more than approximately 125.  We did not get all the way there but we got a long way along the road.  We will continue to do that.We listened to what people had to say on Drogheda hospital.  We increased the number of medical beds, community intervention teams, home care packages, long-term care and intermediate care and we promised to carry out a capacity study.  The study revealed there was a capacity issue.  We put in additional medical beds to get on top of the situation.  There have been improvements but I accept they are not enough.  I make it clear there will be changes to the emergency department in Navan hospital, but they will not happen immediately because the capacity is not there to maintain a safe service.  I always said I would put patient safety first, be honest with people and say whether a service was being closed because of money or due to safety.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Search Warrants) Bill to the House.  The aim of the Bill is to address the implications of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ali Charaf Damache v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ireland and the Attorney General, which was delivered on 23 February this year.  In the case the court found that the search warrant provision in section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 was unconstitutional.  As a consequence, there is a gap in the State’s armoury to tackle the threat posed by terrorism and other serious crime.  It is important we move quickly to close this gap, and I ask for the co-operation of the House in the speedy passage of this Bill in order that it may become law before the summer vacation.It would help Deputies in their consideration of the Bill if I outlined the background to the judgment and its main elements.  The proceedings challenging the constitutionality of section 29 were initiated by an individual awaiting trial on a charge of making threatening telephone calls in connection with an investigation into alleged international terrorism.  The alleged terrorist activity related to a conspiracy to murder Lars Vilks, a Swedish cartoonist whose drawings depicted the Islamic prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog and which provoked serious unrest in a number of Islamic countries.  The individual was charged on foot of evidence gathered under the authority of a search warrant issued under section 29.  For the information of Deputies I will read the relevant part of section 29:Where a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent is satisfied that there is reasonable ground for believing that evidence of or relating to the commission or intended commission of an offence ... is to be found in any place ... he may issue to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant a search warrant under this section in relation to such place.The warrant at the centre of the proceedings was issued by the superintendent who was not only in charge of the investigation but actively involved in it.  It authorised the search of the individual's home.  The individual was arrested for the offence of conspiracy to murder and was subsequently prosecuted on a charge of making a telephone call of a threatening character.  I wish to say for the record that there is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of any member of the Garda Síochána involved in the investigation.  The superintendent who authorised the warrant did so in good faith within the law as it was understood at the time.The case submitted on behalf of the applicant was that section 29 was repugnant to the Constitution as it permitted a member of the Garda Síochána who had been actively involved in a criminal investigation to determine whether a search warrant should issue in relation to his or her own investigation.  The defence submitted that as a matter of constitutional justice, a decision authorising interference with an individual's right to privacy should, at a minimum, be made by someone independent of the investigation.  The Supreme Court, on appeal, granted the declaration that section 29 was invalid on the ground that it permitted a search of a dwelling on foot of a warrant that was not issued by an independent person.  The court identified a number of important aspects to the issuing of search warrants which have assisted in shaping the approach adopted in the Bill before the House this afternoon.First, for the process of obtaining a search warrant to be meaningful, it is necessary that the person authorising the search is able to assess the conflicting interests of the State and the individual in an impartial manner.  Of note in this regard is that the court accepted that the issuing of a warrant is an administrative act rather than the administration of justice and therefore is not required to be performed by a judge.  Of course, irrespective of whether the decision maker is a judge, he or she must, as restated by the court, act judicially, that is having full regard for the principles of natural justice.Second, the court emphasised that the dwelling is afforded special constitutional protection.  Article 40.5 expressly provides that the dwelling "is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law".  As pointed out by the court, any such interference by law must adhere to the fundamental legal norms postulated by the Constitution.  The court concluded that section 29 did not incorporate the fundamental principle of an independent decision maker and accordingly fell foul of the Constitution.  The court also stated that it was deciding the matter on the case before it and that it had not considered or addressed situations of urgency.  This is an important statement as the Statute Book contains a small number of other provisions which permit senior officers of the force to issue warrants.  For the most part, these other provisions can be distinguished from the impugned section as they are restricted to circumstances of urgency requiring the immediate issue of a warrant that would render it impracticable to apply to a District Court judge.  I will return to those provisions later.In the period since the judgment was handed down, my efforts have been directed towards seeking to ensure the Garda Síochána has all the legislative back-up it requires to investigate terrorist and other serious criminal activity.  That is the aim of the Bill before the House.  I reassure Deputies that it is not the case that the Garda Síochána is without search powers following the court judgment.  The Garda can avail of other statutory powers which allow applications for search warrants to be made to District Court judges.  In addition, the law allows gardaí to enter premises, including dwellings, for the purpose of carrying out arrests or to protect the lives of persons within.  The striking down of section 29 does, however, have the potential to hamper Garda investigations in situations of urgency where there is insufficient time to contact a judge.  It is for this reason the Government has moved swiftly to replace the impugned provision with a constitutionally robust one that seeks to ensure the proper balance is struck between the preservation of the security of the State and the constitutional protection afforded.Before turning to the provisions of the Bill, I would like to say a few words about its scope.  In particular, I want to emphasise that it is focused on future investigations and does not - indeed, it could not - have any effect on existing section 29 warrants.  Deputies will be aware that there is no legislative option open to the Government to address retrospectively any concern that may arise in respect of such warrants.  Clearly, it is not possible for legislation to make something constitutional that the Supreme Court has declared to be unconstitutional.  However, cases that might be affected by the terms of the judgment will be the subject of examination by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Garda Síochána to decide how to proceed.  In cases where prosecutions are being considered, it is a matter for the DPP to decide whether to proceed.  Where convictions have already occurred, it is a matter for the courts in the event of a challenge to such convictions to consider whether they should stand.I acknowledge that, for the victims of crime, the possible quashing of convictions that their evidence may have helped to secure is distressing and difficult to accept.  I acknowledge also that the possibility that they may be called on to participate in retrials will bring further anxiety.  However, at the heart of any criminal justice system in a democracy is a requirement to try accused persons in due course of law.  This necessarily includes a requirement to secure convictions on the basis of evidence gathered in conformity with the Constitution.I will now outline the provisions of the Bill.  It is a short Bill comprising just four sections.  Section 1 directly addresses the judgment.  It substitutes section 29 in its entirety to establish a new procedure for the issuing of search warrants under the 1939 Act that adheres to the principles set out by the court.  In addition, I have taken this opportunity to update the section by incorporating some elements that have become standard in more recently enacted search warrant powers.Before outlining the new procedure, let me say that the offences to which this section will apply remain almost unchanged and comprise any offence under the 1939 Act itself; any offence that is for the time being a scheduled offence under Part V of the 1939 Act, that is to say, which may be tried before the Special Criminal Court, examples including firearms and explosives offences and the offences of directing an unlawful or criminal organisation; any offence under the Criminal Law Act 1976, which includes inciting or inviting a person to join an unlawful organisation; and treason.  Also covered are the inchoate offences of attempting or conspiring to commit or inciting the commission of one of the offences I have mentioned.  The only change is the inclusion of the offence of incitement.  I have included it to ensure all forms of criminal liability are covered.The new procedure for the issuing of search warrants in respect of these offences is founded on the premise that, absent exceptional circumstances, applications for search warrants are best made to District Court judges.  This is provided for in subsection (2).  While the issuing of a search warrant does not constitute the administration of justice and need not, therefore, be restricted to judges, it is the case that judges are demonstrably independent of criminal investigations and their involvement provides the necessary impartial supervision emphasised in the Supreme Court judgment.That said, circumstances may arise where a warrant is required immediately to prevent the destruction of vital evidence or to prevent the commission of a serious crime.  In such circumstances and in the event that the District Court judge for the particular district cannot be contacted within the time available, it is necessary to provide a fall-back option while continuing to adhere to the fundamental principle of an independent decision maker.  Such urgent circumstances may not arise frequently, but this does not absolve us of the responsibility of ensuring the Garda has the power to act when necessary.Subsection (3) provides for this fall-back option.  It allows a senior officer of the Garda Síochána to issue a warrant.  By "senior officer", I am referring to a member not below the rank of superintendent.  I would emphasise that an investigating garda will not simply be able to choose whether to apply to a District Court judge or a senior officer.  He or she must apply to a District Court judge unless the very limited circumstances that permit an application to a senior officer are present.Before detailing these limited circumstances, I should mention that the basic test for the grant of a search warrant applies to both judge-issued warrants and Garda-issued warrants under this section.  In each case, before issuing a warrant to a sergeant, the issuer must be satisfied that "there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence to which the section applies is to be found in any place".  I have chosen the standard of "reasonable grounds for suspecting" as it mirrors the standard for obtaining search warrants contained in more recent statutes.  For the purposes of this section, "place" is defined in non-exhaustive terms in subsection (12) and includes a dwelling.I have decided not to carry forward the wording of the original section 29, which allowed a warrant to be issued in respect of "the intended commission of an offence".  Instead, warrants under the replacement section may only be issued in respect of "the commission of an offence to which th[e] section applies".  Deputies will recall that the offences to which the section will apply include attempts, conspiracies and incitement.  I am concerned that to go further than this and to retain the concept of "intended commission" would give rise to a perception that search warrants could be authorised in circumstances where no overt act in furtherance of an offence had been committed.Returning to the limited circumstances in which a senior officer may issue a warrant, these are set out in subsections (4) and (5).  Subsection (4) contains the key two-part test that must be met before a senior officer may issue a warrant.  First, the officer may not issue a warrant unless he or she is satisfied it is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence to which the section applies.  Second, the circumstances of urgency giving rise to the need for the immediate issue of the warrant must be such as to render it impracticable to apply to a District Court judge.  The short duration of such a Garda-issued warrant - 48 hours compared with the seven day duration of a judge-issued warrant - further emphasises that this option is restricted to genuinely exceptional circumstances.Subsection (5) adds a further critical condition and addresses the heart of the Supreme Court judgment.  It requires the senior officer to be independent of the investigation concerned.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to subsection (12), which defines the meaning of "independent of" as it relates to an investigation.  It is defined as "not being in charge of, or involved in, that investigation".  In the context of the command structures within the Garda Síochána, this means an officer who is not in a position to issue directions in respect of that investigation.  Essentially, what will be required in practice is that the investigating garda will apply to a senior officer in a parallel chain of command to his or her own.Clearly, there are other persons who could potentially fulfil this fall-back role.  For example, during the debate in the Upper House, the possibility of extending the role of peace commissioners so that they might step into the breach in urgent circumstances was mooted.  Peace commissioners continue to have powers to issue warrants under a small number of statutes, but the policy in more recent times has been to limit the issuing of warrants in respect of serious crime to judges and, exceptionally, to senior gardaí.  This is the approach I have followed in the Bill.  I am satisfied it meets the requirements of the judgment and is further bolstered by subsection (11), which places a statutory obligation on the senior officer issuing the warrant to record in writing, either at the time or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the grounds on which he or she did so.  The making of such a record was identified specifically by the Supreme Court as best practice.The remaining subsections deal with the execution of the warrant and the conduct of the search.  A distinguishing feature as regards other search warrant provisions is that members of the Defence Forces may accompany members of the Garda Síochána during the search.  This is a long-standing feature of section 29 and is an example of the Defence Forces being expressly authorised to act in aid of the civil authorities.As is generally the case with search warrants, a warrant under this section will authorise the entry of the place named in the warrant, the search of both the place and any person found there and the seizure of anything found at the place or in the possession of a person present at the place.  The right to enter is subject to the obligation to produce the warrant or a copy of it, if requested.  This requirement is new to the 1939 Act and is intended as an added safeguard.  The entry may be achieved by use of reasonable force, if necessary.  The qualification of the force permitted as "reasonable" is new.As is also generally the case with search warrants, subsection (8) provides that a warrant under this section will allow members of either force acting under the authority of the warrant to require any person present at the place where the search is being carried out to give to the members his or her name and address.  An arrest power is provided in the event that any person obstructs or attempts to obstruct a member in the carrying out of his or her duties, fails to give a member his or her name and address or gives a false or misleading name or address.The final element of section 1 that I would highlight is subsection (9).  It creates an offence of obstructing or attempting to obstruct a member, refusing to give a name or address on request or giving a false or misleading name or address.  The maximum penalties on conviction are a class A fine, which is a fine not exceeding €5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.  Deputies will note this offence is summary in nature.  This represents a change from the impugned section which allowed the offence to be tried on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of a term of imprisonment of five years.  As this offence is ancillary to the search rather than a principal offence, I am satisfied it is appropriate that it be summary in nature.  I will conclude my remarks on section 1 by saying that its contents represent very careful consideration of the Supreme Court judgment in consultation with the Attorney General and I am satisfied the new procedures incorporate the fundamental principle of an impartial decision maker as required by the Constitution.Deputies will have noted that sections 2 and 3 concern search warrant provisions relating to suspected drug offences.  As I mentioned, there are a small number of other statutory provisions which allow for Garda-issued warrants, generally in circumstances of urgency.  One such important provision is that contained in section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, which permits a member not below the rank of superintendent to issue a warrant under section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Certain conditions must be met, including that circumstances of urgency that require the immediate issue of a warrant arise that would render it impracticable to apply to a District Court judge or a peace commissioner.The purpose of the amendments to the 1996 Act contained in section 3 of the Bill is to apply two further safeguards to the issuing of such warrants, first, to require the senior officer who issues a warrant to be independent of the investigation, and second, to require the issuing officer to record the grounds on which the warrant is issued.  These amendments will bring Garda-issued warrants under section 26 of the 1977 Act into line with those issued under the replacement for section 29.  Section 2 makes a minor consequential change to section 26 of the 1977 Act.Section 4 is the final section of the Bill and includes the Short Title and the commencement arrangements.  As Deputies will appreciate from my earlier remarks, I am anxious to ensure there is no undue delay in the commencement of this Bill once it is passed.  For this reason section 4(2) provides that the Bill will come into operation the day after its passing.Before concluding my remarks I would like to say a few words about search warrants generally.  There is a complex series of approximately 300 Acts and statutory regulations, some dating from before the foundation of the State, that confer powers of search and seizure.  There is no doubt that there is great variation between these provisions in each step in the search warrant process, including applications, issuing, execution and safeguards.  At a very practical level there is no standard search warrant form.  These are all matters which impact on operational effectiveness and efficient use of resources.I referred in my earlier remarks to the consultation paper on search warrants prepared by the Law Reform Commission.  That paper contains a lengthy list of provisional recommendations on reforming this area of the law.  Of particular interest in the context of the Bill before the House is the commission's consideration of the extent to which technology could be used to apply for and to issue warrants, thereby possibly overcoming some of the difficulties that arise where a warrant is required immediately.  I look forward to the Commission's final report in this regard and have asked officials to conduct a comprehensive review taking account of the commission's report when it is published.I reiterate my call for the support of this House in ensuring the passage of this important Bill in order that it may become law before the summer vacation.  I commend this Bill to the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I commend the Minister and his officials on their very efficient and robust response to the judgment.  We will support the Bill and I will do my best to facilitate my party's co-operation in concluding this before the recess.  The Minister has covered most of the arguments and the importance of warrants, which is fundamental in the proper investigation of crime.  In this Bill he has provided for the judgment and the Minister has also acknowledged the forthcoming Law Reform Commission report, which will give us a chance to bring this legislation up to the level of current technology.  I have always held the view that the legal system has been slow in responding to the advantages offered by technology, and I hope the Minister will use the opportunity of his response to the Law Reform Commission to drag his former profession a little bit into the 21st century in the use of technology and the Internet in the administration of justice.I will comment on some issues, particularly in light of the Minister's remarks.  He indicated the Director of Public Prosecution is reviewing a number of cases in light of the Supreme Court judgment and that there may be outstanding issues.  The system should be aware of the need to ensure that at all times the victims of the crimes should be involved in consultation, and they should not read of a decision being overturned either within the court or in the media.  If something happens as a result of the Supreme Court judgment that involves a victim or family of a victim, they should be involved from the outset.  It should not come like a bolt from the blue.I note the Minister's comments on restricting the use of a warrant with regard to the intended commission of an offence.  I know he does not have the figures this evening but perhaps in advance of Committee Stage he might provide us, if possible, with the numbers of warrants previously issued with this intent in mind, as opposed to warrants issued after an offence has been committed.  Will this impact on the ability of the Garda to collate information or evidence for the processing or preparation of a case?  If that is the case, will other powers be furnished to account for that?More than 100 separate Acts were passed between 1831 and 2008 containing search warrant provisions, with 170 statutory instruments used between 1979 and 2008.  They are a common feature of our judicial system.  The Minister referred to offences in major legislation which was so important in darker times for the State, and search warrants were a very significant weapon.  I welcome that the Minister has acknowledged that the gardaí involved in the cases referred to were acting within their understanding of the law at the time.  That is important.In any redesign of the search warrant procedures, it is important we strike a balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of those suspected of crime.  However, crime and criminals are moving much faster than we, as a society, are doing to keep up.  The methods of crime and the ability to redefine crime is quite outstanding.  We must ensure the tools we use to investigate crime and keep people to account are as flexible and robust as what is demanded.  Although I support any move to protect people's rights, it is also important to show we will not choke our ability to investigate crime in doing so.  We must not tie the hands of those to whom we entrust our protection and the job of investigating crime with added regulation and administration, particularly in this area.  If we did, we could inadvertently hand an advantage to people who seek to act in a criminal way.The Minister referred briefly to technology, and there are many areas on which one could comment.  In this day and age, a District Court judge should be available at any time, even if it is not a judge in the immediate district.  There could be electronic communication or "judge on-call" system, although I do not mean to demean the profession.  A judge should be available to a garda within a reasonable commute at all times.  The Minister has tightened provisions so that only people not below the level of superintendent can further the warrant process.  It would be preferable for everybody if a judge could be involved, as he or she would be truly independent in the assessment of a crime.  Given that we have so many of them, it is not beyond the possibility that some sort of on-call system should be available in order that a warrant could be signed.If a judge is not physically present, we should be able to have some kind of judicial interaction through protected electronic signatures.  A superintendent may be involved in a case or on a separate stream, but such action should be used in the most limited circumstances.  It may not be possible to consider this issue in the Bill but the Minister might examine it in the context of his response to the Law Reform Commission.  Perhaps we can involve the Judiciary in a consultation.I commend the Bill to the House and it covers the judgment.  We will support its speedy enactment and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I share the Minister's sense of concern and urgency in terms of getting the Bill through the House.  I assure the Minister that we will do everything within our remit to facilitate it.  I do not intend to go into the background of why we are here because the Minister has outlined the reasons in his opening remarks, especially in respect of section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 and the reasoning behind the decision, which found the section to be unconstitutional.  We should hold a discussion at some stage on the knock-on effects of that ruling.I fully understand that it is up to the Director of Public Prosecutions to review cases which may or may not go to trial.  Several relevant cases have collapsed and associated decisions have been appealed.  I call on the Minister to provide some clarity for the Opposition spokespersons.  If he cannot do this during his wrap-up, then perhaps he will do it in a briefing setting and provide us with some details on the number of trials that this could possibly impact upon.  That is important.Last week, I raised a matter relating to the Anglo Irish Bank investigation.  I have no wish to muddy the waters but it is important to have some clarity because much of the evidence in that investigation was obtained on the back of search warrants.  This is something of which we should be aware and I imagine the Minister and the DPP will be examining those cases.How did we get here?  I know from reading the transcripts of the Seanad that the Minister referred to the Morris tribunal and some of the associated findings.  I agree completely that Mr. Justice Morris did not state that this particular provision was unconstitutional.  He was unable to make that statement given the setting in which he found himself.  He raised certain concerns and I question whether those concerns have been adequately addressed.  I know from reading the transcripts of the debate in the Seanad that the Minister touched on what unfolded in the case of a former Minister with responsibility for justice following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, who took the view that the provisions was satisfactory as it stood.The Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission.  We now know that the section has been found to be unconstitutional.  Whether in a tribunal setting or a criminal investigation, when a judge makes such a comment, we should at least investigate it.  I call on the Minister to confirm in his wrap-up whether the Attorney General was consulted at the time on the back of those comments made during the Morris tribunal.We welcome some of the provisions.  They bring some clarity to the situation and this is important.  Subsection (2) deals with the issuing of search warrants by District Court judges, and this is welcome.  This is the way we should do our business.  Deputy Calleary suggested we should strive for a situation where all search warrants are issued in this manner.  I realise that is not possible at the moment because in certain cases there is an urgent and immediate need to issue a search warrant.  The Minister has tried to address some of the associated issues in the Bill.  In particular, subsection (4) puts in place a two-part test which stipulates that only an officer of the rank of superintendent or higher can issue a warrant and he must be independent of the investigation.  All of this is welcome and we are reaching a point where we are striking the right balance between giving the Garda the necessary tools and powers to carry out investigations and respecting the rights of citizens.The Minister is well aware of my views and those of my party on the Offences against the State Act.  These have not changed, nor will they.  I recognise, however, that the Garda must carry out the tasks we have set it, that it must have the necessary tools to do so and that search warrants are a necessary part of that process.  For this reason, we will support the Bill as it goes through the House.  We believe some of the safeguards that have been put in place, limited though they are, improve the situation.  They bring clarity and put in place an independent process in respect of the issuing of search warrants.  We could go further, and that is something we can consider, not in the context of this Bill but perhaps further down the line.  Deputy Calleary touched on some of the possible solutions, including electronic signatures.  One must question whether these will be possible or whether such a change would of itself be deemed unconstitutional.  I am unsure of the answer, but perhaps that is a conversation for another day.Following examination of the Bill, we are satisfied that while safeguards exist and improvements have been made, there is room for further improvement.  We are also aware, however, that there is a need to resource the Garda not only in terms of giving it the powers for search warrants but to provide adequate resourcing across all levels.  This is an important part of the investigative process, and therefore we will be supporting it.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in respect of this new legislation and for allowing me to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.  I welcome the debate because it affords me an opportunity to examine in-depth justice issues, warrants and the whole system.  Many of our citizens have been let down by the system, and this is something we must accept as part of the debate.  How can we refer to a system of justice when people are swanning around after murdering a beautiful daughter and her mother and when whole communities are intimidated or threatened each night by drugs gangs and no one seems to care about it?  This is the reality which I wish to highlight while the Minister is in the House, and I will develop these points.  It is important these things are said because many people are hurting because of a lack of fairness and justice in the justice system.  This is linked to the debate.  Many people are intimidated and attacked.  Many people throughout the city are afraid to go to the Garda because of widespread intimidation.  Often they are left on their own, and this is something we must address as well.  Many people believe the whole system has let them down.  I am one of these people and this is why I raise the matter now.The primary purpose of the Bill is to restore in updated form the search warrant provision in section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  This was struck down by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case of Ali Charaf Damache v. DPP, Ireland and the Attorney General.  The Bill also amends the provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 relating to the issue of search warrants under section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  We must deal with the Supreme Court decision but we must also deal with the drug trafficking issue as well.The problems have ruined our society and our country but there is another aspect to this as well.  One issue rarely raised in the debate is the fact that drug dealers make money because there is a market for drugs, and it is important to address this issue.  Many of those in the market come from affluent families, or they are people who have money in their pockets and can afford to buy drugs and treat them as a social outlet.  This is not acceptable and it should never be tolerated because it is ruining the country, our youth and our nation.  It is important to bear this in mind when we are discussing this legislation, especially the section relating to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.Section 1 substitutes section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 with a new section 29.  Subsection (1) identifies the offences to which section 29 applies.  These include an offence under the 1939 Act or the Criminal Law Act 1976; an offence that is a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act, that is to say, offences that may be tried before the Special Criminal Court; treason; and the related offences of attempting, conspiring or inciting.  We should consider the whole history of the Special Criminal Court as well.  Sadly, during the conflict in the North, there were occasions on which power and authority were abused by certain sections of society and certain gardaí.  This is a reality we must face.  At all times, we must be conscious of civil liberties and human rights, bearing in mind that we must protect the State and citizen.  We must always be vigilant in this regard.  Even if only a minority of cases collapse, it is not good enough or acceptable that we turn our backs on them and walk away from the miscarriages of justice.Subsection (2) provides that a District Court judge may issue a warrant for the search of a place.  To do so, the judge must be satisfied by information on oath from a member of the Garda Síochána of sergeant rank or above that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to the commission of an offence to which the section applies is to be found in that place.  Trust is another issue.  As one who knows many gardaí and who has had family members who served in the force, I realise trust is a key issue for the public.  One does not demand respect from a country or society; one earns it.  Any good police officer on the beat will tell one that.  I worked with many of them in the north inner city for more than 25 years and learned that the good gardaí were the ones who earned the respect of their community.  The good men and women in the drug squad earned the respect of the community, and by God did they benefit from it.  It is a question of public service and trust.  Trust is the issue when dealing with a member of An Garda Síochána of sergeant rank or above.  The power being given to officers is important but they must act in the interest of good public service and citizens.Subsection (3) empowers a member of the Garda Síochána of superintendent rank or above to issue a search warrant under the section to a sergeant or a garda of higher rank.  This power is qualified by subsections (4) and (5).  Subsection (4) provides that a superintendent may issue a warrant under this section only if he or she is satisfied that the warrant is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.  It is important that the investigation be proper.  We want quality policemen who do their job in a professional manner.It is important that we protect and look after our police forces.  In recent days, a young man, Mr. Peadar Heffron, a member of the PSNI, did not receive compensation.  This is appalling and is suggestive of not looking after one's police force.  We have seen the radical changes on this island, including those under the PSNI, yet Mr. Heffron, who was seriously injured and lost a leg, was told he will not be compensated because he was on his way to work when the tragedy occurred.  What utter rubbish.  What a lack of justice in a police system.This matter should be placed on the table at the intergovernmental talks on the North.  One cannot have circumstances in which people are ignored and not given guaranteed protection if they are serving the community.  The same applies to the Garda Síochána.  Many young gardaí have lost their lives.  Over the past two to three years, many young men and women either lost their lives or were injured.  We must put guarantees in place and this should be raised in the debate on this legislation.Subsection (6) concerns the information to be set out in the warrant and the actions that may be carried out pursuant to the warrant.  The actions are those of entry, search, of both the place and any person found there, and seizure of anything found at the place or in the possession of a person present at the place.  The seizure power relates to items that the member of the Garda Síochána or Defence Forces reasonably believes to be evidence of or related to the commission of an offence to which the section applies.  The right to enter is subject to the obligation to produce the warrant or a copy of it, if requested.  The entry may be achieved by use of reasonable force, if necessary.  This is an important subsection because, at times, gardaí must enter people's homes.  In some homes, the residents may be innocent.  There may be one guilty person living there but there may also be innocents, including children.  This is why subsection (6) is important.  Warrants must be produced and clearly visible for all those concerned.Subsection (9) creates a summary offence.  It provides that a person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct a member acting under the authority of a warrant, fails to comply with a requirement to provide their name and address when requested, or gives a false or misleading name or address commits an offence.  The maximum penalties on conviction are a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.  I welcome this subsection because one must have strong, tough legislation, but it must also be balanced.Subsection (10) provides that the power to issue a warrant under the section is without prejudice to any other power conferred by statute to issue a warrant for the search of any place or person.  This is important legislation.The stated purpose of the Bill refers to the drugs issue.  There have been major successes.  I welcome the recent discovery of a huge amount of cocaine.  However, this shows the huge market that exists and that entire communities are suffering.In addition to dealing with the serious issues, including violent crime, we must constantly think of the human aspect.  The recent tragic murder of the journalist, Eugene Moloney, is a classic case.  There is no real outrage at all.  While we were all shocked and horrified, are we now accepting that people coming home from their local pub after having a pint can be assaulted or killed on the streets?  There is no major outrage.  I pay tribute to Mr. Eugene Moloney on his excellent work.  I knew him very well.  He was very involved in the Galway Arts Festival for many years.  Many people had great respect for him as a journalist and human being.  I express my sympathy to his family.We must ensure the Criminal Assets Bureau is developed constantly and is used in the interest of people.  I want to see the money confiscated from criminals used in the most disadvantaged communities that deserve a break.  It is in these areas that the assets of crime should be invested.A number of Deputies raised the resource issue, along with the warrants issue.  This is important because we are living in difficult times.  However, we must ensure quality policing in addition to dealing with the broader resource issue.  Appropriate funding should be made available.Section 4 provides that the Act will commence on the day following its passing, that is, the day following its signature by the President.  The proposed legislation will not result in any significant cost to the Exchequer.I welcome the legislation and will support it.  It is important we have a justice system that respects citizens and is effective.  We need a Garda Síochána that is very professional and has the old-fashioned ethos of public service and the support of the local communities.  As I stated, one must earn respect in any society.  Those involved in policing have a very important role to play.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I thank the House for allowing Deputy Finian McGrath and me to share time.The aim of the Bill, as the Minister stated, is to address the implications of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ali Charaf Damache v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ireland, and the Attorney General, delivered on 23 February 2012.  That was not very long ago.  I compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing forth this legislation in an effort to close the loophole.In the case in question, the court found that the search warrant provision in section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 was unconstitutional.  As a consequence, there is a gap in the State's armoury to tackle the threat posed by terrorism and other serious crimes.  We must remember terrorism has not totally disappeared.  The incidence of serious crime is increasing and we must be ever vigilant.This legislation is progressing quickly.  All Deputies should support this Bill.  I have supported An Garda Síochána my entire life and I have also been involved in community alert schemes.  I compliment those who are involved in community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes.No police force can provide security without the support of the people.  It would be a pity if that ideal were lost.  This is why I am concerned about the closure of rural Garda stations.  Officials might argue they are not needed, but people must know where they can find a friendly garda with whom they can chat about the match or whatever.  In this way, a lot of helpful information can be gleaned.  Mobile patrols will never replace that relationship.  Many of the best gardaí have operated under a community ethos because it is important to know one's community.  The same can apply to religious beliefs and to politics.  We have to know our electorate because there is no better way to gain their support.The warrant at the centre of the court case in February was issued by a superintendent who was not only in charge of the investigation but actively involved in it.  The warrant authorised the search of an individual's home.  This individual was arrested for the offence of conspiracy to murder and was subsequently prosecuted on a charge of making a telephone call of a threatening character.  As the courts found, however, a mistake had been made.  The Minister stated there is no suggestion of impropriety on the part of any member of the Garda involved in the investigation and that the superintendent who authorised the warrant did so in good faith within the law as it was understood at the time.  That is the problem, however.  Did he understand that he should not sign the warrant given his direct involvement in the investigation?  This is why a different superintendent should have been asked to examine the facts coldly, calmly and collectedly.  The superintendent in this case was anxious to deal with a serious situation but a superintendent from a different division would have been able to evaluate the case from a distance.  The case submitted on behalf of the applicant was that section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 was repugnant to the Constitution because it permitted a member of the Garda Síochána who had been actively involved in a criminal investigation to determine whether a search warrant should issue.  Did the superintendent in question fully understand the law?  I accept he may not have had time to apply to the courts for a warrant, but that would have been the preferred option because we depend on the Judiciary to be fair and impartial.The Bill acknowledges that issuing a warrant to search a house is a big decision because one's home is one's castle.  It is disturbing for families if a number of gardaí can search their homes uninvited.  This must always be the last course of action.  While I fully support the Garda in tackling all kinds of crime, they should be considerate when searching premises.  This is why it is important that a different superintendent should issue the warrant.In the period since the judgment was handed down, the Minister's efforts have been directed at seeking to ensure the Garda has all the legislative back-up it requires to investigate terrorism and other serious criminal activity.  That is the aim of the Bill before the House.  I do not believe the Garda has been given the resources and expertise it requires.  The retirement of senior officers has caused a significant drain on expertise and knowledge in the force.  One of my colleagues has tabled a priority question to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.  Many parts of the public service are rehiring individuals who left on the early retirement scheme.  Is this happening in An Garda Síochána, where it should be happening?  That knowledge is vital.  I have met a number of senior gardaí who did not want to retire but were forced to do so because of age and service.  At a time when recruitment of young gardaí has been stopped, we should be trying to hold on to their expertise and experience.A victim's charter may exist but is it being adhered to?  As the previous speaker asked, where are the victims?  How many more Eugene Moloneys will we see in this country because we do not have sufficient resources to police our streets?  Such is our culture of late nights and alcohol consumption that people cannot go home after a night of fun without disturbing anybody else.  The unprovoked attack against that journalist as he was on his way home was obscene.  We must increase sentences.  If a direct physical attack results in death, it is not right that we charge people with manslaughter.  We have to be effective.  Prisons should not be holiday camps.  I am all for restorative justice but the punishment must fit the crime.  Above all, as was mentioned in respect of the psychiatric patient discharged in Donegal, we cannot permit victims' families to live in fear that something similar might happen again unless the perpetrator has gone through rehabilitation or has changed while in custody.  It is not fair that people should be afraid of meeting a former offender in a local town or village.I support the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the Dáil.  I hope it will block the loophole it seeks to address.  However, its scope is limited to future Garda investigations.  There is no legislative option available to the Minister to address existing cases where warrants under section 29 of the 1939 Act may be at issue.  The Oireachtas cannot retrospectively make constitutional that which the Supreme Court has declared to be unconstitutional.This is a short Bill which contains four sections.  It replaces section 29 of the 1939 Act with a provision designed to conform to the Supreme Court judgment.  It requires applications for search warrants to be made to a judge of the District Court where possible.  In limited circumstances a garda of superintendent rank or higher may authorise a search warrant where circumstances of urgency render it impractical to apply to the District Court.  The issuing officer must be independent of the investigation.  It is important gardaí are made fully aware of this requirement.The house of a former colleague was searched recently and the individual was arrested.  It was alleged that he had defrauded the State of sums of money.If that is the case, he should be punished but he is innocent until proven guilty.  Why was a posse of members of the media waiting at the Garda station when he was arrested?  That was scandalous, outrageous and should not take place.  Are media outlets applying pressure on the Garda Síochána to take certain actions?  Is the Minister able to stand up to the media or are they too powerful?  While I do not wish to condemn all media, everyone is entitled to his or her day in court and his or her good name.  Individuals and their families must be allowed to live their lives without major intrusion.  I contrast the case to which I referred with the failure to arraign a single banker, despite the billions of euro involved.  We also had the case of a certain gentleman being telephoned to make arrangements to come to a Garda station by appointment.  I will not refer to the person by name but everyone is aware of the case.  In another case, a person's house was ransacked on the basis of an alleged offence involving €1,800.  Let no one misinterpret me because I do not condone any offences.  Even if only €1 is involved, an offence is still wrong.Balance, fair play and, above all, transparency are required.  We must ensure warrants are properly issued and executed.  I do not know who issued the warrant in the case to which I refer or if the matter came before a District Court but I have been a victim of similar behaviour.  A summons was served on me at 11 p.m., which is an inappropriate time to visit any home and especially so in my case as I had a young child of 11 years at the time.  The summons served on me referred to allegations of which I was subsequently cleared by a jury.  The case was badly handled and characterised by bullying.  Two police cars and a number of gardaí arrived at my house as if I was a criminal.  This type of bullying, which is taking place, must be taken into account.  A small number of gardaí do not behave properly.  However, I support the vast majority of gardaí, as I have demonstrated by supporting this Bill which will give them the tools of the trade.  The small minority must be weeded out.Last November, I referred in the House to a case involving the theft of machinery from a yard during a repossession by a bank.  The institution in question has since returned the machinery and apologised for an outrageous injustice, which was perpetrated with gardaí present.  A complaint was made, an investigation carried out but no prosecution followed.  The bank returned the machines, apologised unreservedly to me and the family in question and sent a representative to visit the family.  However, mistakes were also made by the Garda Síochána.  While I do not propose to engage in a witch-hunt against any member of the force, redress had not been made because prosecutions have not followed in a case that involved breaking and entering a premises in the middle of the night.  This does not reflect good practice.  The chief superintendent and local superintendent in Clonmel gave me a good reception when I met them to discuss this issue.  While they are embarrassed by what occurred, it should not have happened.  Anybody can make a mistake.  I concur with the old adages, "There but for the grace of God go I" and "Any man who never made a mistake never made anything".  It is not difficult to offer an apology.  If wrongdoing or heavy-handedness on the part of the law is proven, it should be acknowledged, efforts should be made to put it right and an apology offered.  It is important, therefore, that in introducing the Bill we ensure there is no repeat of the court case which found the current law repugnant to the Constitution.  Fair play is vital in this regard.To put on my community alert hat, having a local garda who knows local people on the beat is the best approach because he or she will be able to obtain information.  I am not referring to informers and so forth but it behoves all of us to protect our communities and families.  We should look out for others by noting suspicious activities and we should not be afraid to report them.  As the previous speaker noted, respect must be mutual.Community gardaí in Clonmel and Cahir are doing tremendous work but are being sucked into other duties because Garda numbers in the area are low.  I appeal to the Minister to address the issues of the Garda station in Clonmel and, more important, Garda strength in the town.  Clonmel used to be the largest inland town in the country and is now the second largest inland town but this is not reflected in Garda numbers.  I do not say this to frighten anyone.  Gardaí in the town, who do a hard job under Superintendent Courtney, need resources, the tools of the trade and half-decent accommodation.  One can have all the laws in the world but they will be ineffective without manpower and vehicles.  The requirement to withdraw Garda vehicles once they have reached 300,000 miles is silly.  One car could be a wreck after 300,000 miles, while another could be in perfect condition.  We must be realistic in these financially constrained times.  We must ensure the Garda Síochána have sufficient resources, legal support and, above all, community support.  Without these, policing is impossible.I support the Bill and hope it will be speedily passed because it is needed to plug a loophole.  I look forward to working with the Minister on it.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this short but important Bill.  The law on search warrants has developed into a complex and extensive legal process.  The Bill will close the legal loophole with regard to search warrants which threatened to wreck prosecutions against dissident republicans and other alleged criminals.  The approach to search warrants was developed in the 19th century and formed the basis for the law as it stood on the foundation of the State.  Since then, a complex series of Acts and statutory regulations conferring powers of search and seizure has been put in place.  The content of these statutory powers has been greatly influenced by the need to ensure they conform to relevant fundamental rights in the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights.The legislation has been drafted to give new search powers to gardaí, following the ruling in March of this year that previous search warrants were unconstitutional.  Under these new provisions, warrants needed quickly may be granted by a District Court judge or Garda superintendent who is not directly involved in the inquiry.  The execution of a search warrant naturally involves an interference with one's privacy, be it the individual's home, workplace, vehicle, documents or otherwise.  The right to privacy is not absolute, however.  While it exists as a safeguard which may be relied upon to prevent or challenge an undue interference with one's privacy, it will not necessarily prevent all interferences.  We must continue to maintain a balance between protection of the State and protection of the individual.  It is in the interest of the State to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences or ensure adherence to the law.I applaud the Minister who has moved to address a problem in the law that has led to a number of successful appeals to criminal convictions because search warrants issued during some investigations were found to be unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court decision in March rendered unconstitutional section 29(1) of the Offences Against the State Act.  The case involved a man who took an appeal against his prosecution, claiming that a Garda superintendent working on the investigation should not have issued a warrant allowing a search of his property.  This ruling meant any evidence gathered under such warrants was inadmissible and subsequently derailed prosecutions.  Subsequent appeals based on the so-called Damache ruling have been successful in having criminal convictions quashed and have included a County Cork businessman who was convicted of laundering the alleged proceeds of the Northern Bank raid.  It was, therefore, essential that the implications of the Supreme Court judgment were addressed as a priority.  The Minister is doing so in this Bill.The striking out of section 29 has potentially significant implications for Garda operations in the event that urgent circumstances arise, for example, in respect of firearms and explosives, and it is not practicable to apply to a District Court judge in the time available.  District Court judges usually deal with search warrant applications that apply to the areas to which they are assigned.  Under the proposed legislation, section 29 will be replaced with a new measure that will allow District Court judges to issue warrants for neighbouring areas.  A judge may issue a warrant from the court or from his or her home if gardaí arrive seeking a warrant urgently.  It is planned that senior Garda officers not below the rank of superintendent who are independent of the investigation will have the power to issue a warrant in urgent circumstances where it was not possible to contact a judge immediately.The scope of the Bill is limited to addressing future Garda investigations.  There is no legislative option available to the Minister to address existing cases where section 29 warrants may be at issue.  The Bill also amends the search warrant provisions which apply in cases of suspected drug offences and already provide for superintendents to issue warrants in circumstances of urgency where it is impracticable to apply to a District Court judge.As the impact of this Bill is so evident, it is imperative that it be enacted before the summer recess to restore the search powers available to the Garda Síochána in respect of subversive and other serious crimes.  These proposals will ensure the operational requirements of the Garda are met and that all decisions authorising the search of any place, including a dwelling, are taken by a person who is neutral to the investigation.  It also is important to note the Minister has stated this Bill is limited to addressing the implications of the Supreme Court judgment.I ask for Members' co-operation in the passage of this most significant Bill as speedily as possible in order that it may become law before the summer recess and I commend it to the House.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This is legislation that to an extent restores the right of gardaí above the rank of superintendent to issue permission for a search warrant in serious and urgent circumstances.  The Bill is necessary as a result of a court decision that certain ways of issuing search warrants were in part unconstitutional.  They did not protect adequately the privacy of the individual when allowing access to his or her home or any other place that may be of assistance to the Garda in pursuing a case.Over the years, because of the threat of terrorism and the activities of certain organisations which tried continually to subvert the authority of the State, many laws were enacted to ensure they did not succeed.  This meant the Houses of the Oireachtas enacted laws to support the Garda and the Army in order that they could carry out their duties.  Thankfully, the serious threat posed in the past has been resolved to a great extent.  The peace process in Northern Ireland has come a very long way and is progressing well.  The level of progress was evident in the recent meeting between Queen Elizabeth and Martin McGuinness.  It was an image many people thought they would never see.Although I disagree with Sinn Féin in almost all aspects of its policy pronouncements, I welcome its relatively recent conversion to democratic politics and the part it played and continues to play in the peace process.  I am glad that in future political battles, the ballot box will be the only weapon used by that party.  That said, there are other organisations that seek to rekindle the Troubles and would do so if they had the requisite resources and support.  Thankfully, they lack such support but they can still pose a serious threat.  Therefore, the security forces must have the powers to ensure such people are brought to task.  A valid search warrant that will stand the test of a constitutional challenge is a necessary tool in bringing convictions against such people.  In addition to the threat posed by these still-existing small subversive groups, the threat of organised criminality also must be addressed.  Irish society has seen a major increase in organised crime and gangland activity in recent years and I note many such gangs are or were closely linked with subversive groups.While the Constitution and the rights of ordinary people must always be respected, strong constitutionally proofed laws also are required to deal with these elements in society.  The Minister is introducing a measure in this legislation to ensure warrants issued in the future are not open to challenge in the courts.  One of the main observations of the court was that the warrant should be issued by a person, not necessarily a judge, who was independent of the investigating team.  The court held that a warrant that is required urgently can be issued by a such an independent person who has decided that such a warrant is necessary and that such a person should record the reasons for his or her decisions.  In this Bill, that authority is given to a garda above the rank of superintendent who is not involved in the case or who does not have any direct supervision or authority over the investigating team.  The warrant may only be issued in these circumstances when a judge is not available or there would be undue delay in seeking a judge's permission.Fine Gael always has and will continue to be hugely supportive of the Garda and the Army in their efforts to bring criminals to justice.  Since the foundation of the State, there has never been any question of its resolve in this matter.  However, the economic crisis is forcing the Minister and the Government to make difficult decisions due to necessary financial cutbacks.  There is concern, especially among people in rural communities, about any proposed closure of Garda stations or reductions in numbers.  While search warrants are an essential tool in fighting crime, so too is local integration of the Garda.  The intelligence gardaí get from the public is very important in assisting the Garda to solve crime.  The co-operation and goodwill of ordinary people is a key element in this regard and community gardaí are central to such co-operation.  When in opposition, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, produced a valuable paper on the importance of supporting the continued development of a community police force.  Community policing helps to solve crimes and helps enormously to prevent crimes such as anti-social behaviour.  Prevention always is better than cure, and in most cases it also is more cost-effective in the long run.  For example, if activities such as anti-social behaviour can be stopped early, this helps young people to avoid getting involved in more serious crimes.  In turn, this reduces the pressure on the entire criminal justice system and saves families a great deal of pain.  It promotes a proactive community environment that enhances quality of life for all.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to continue to ensure community policing remains centre stage in any reorganisation process.As for this Bill, it is clear the Garda needs the powers to act swiftly in urgent and serious cases.  This Bill will enable it to do this without compromising people's rights and I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I have a few brief comments to make on this Bill, which, as the previous speakers have noted, is a small item of legislation to deal with a situation that has arisen following a recent Supreme Court judgment.  I commend the Minister and his officials on acting swiftly on foot of that decision.  I also agree with previous speakers with regard to my own interaction with members of the Garda Síochána in my constituency and the job they do, and I express my full support for their efforts.It is worth pointing out that after the power of arrest and detention, the power to search someone's home, dwelling, premises or property probably is the most significant power one can give to one's police force.  Consequently, it is worth examining in detail what this legislation proposes because, ultimately, it could have a highly significant impact on people's constitutional rights.  Article 40.5 of the Constitution is quite clear about the inviolability of the dwelling, save in accordance with law.  Recently, the Supreme Court in its judgment decided that section 29(1) of the Offences against the State Act 1939 contradicted Article 40.5 of the Constitution and the importance of the inviolability of the home.I support fully this legislation because the Minister has struck the right balance between the necessity to protect people's right to privacy and their own home and the necessity to give the Garda the correct powers to enforce the law.  The legislation is quite clear in that it now makes it necessary in all cases, except in exceptional cases, for the Garda to have a warrant issued by a District Court judge.  The exception is provided in a case where urgency is a matter of priority.  It is appropriate that in cases in which it might be difficult to get a District Court judge and in which destruction of evidence or people's property is possible or people's lives or health are potentially at risk, an officer of superintendent rank or above who is not involved in the investigation would be given the authority to issue a search warrant.As for the judgment from which this legislation comes, namely, Ali Charaf Damache v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ireland and the Attorney General, it is important to note the gardaí concerned did nothing wrong.  They acted in accordance with the law as laid down in 1939 but the Supreme Court, on foot of a challenge, decided the aforementioned legislation was repugnant to the Constitution.  I support the Minister fully in what he proposes to do in this regard, which comprises a small but significant change in how search warrants will be granted in the future.  The requirement that a District Court judge will issue the warrant, save in exceptional circumstances, is a further protection of people’s constitutional rights.I commend the Minister.  In my ten years in the Oireachtas, including one year in this House, I find the Minister for Justice and Equality tends to be the busiest Minister from a legislative point of view.  This Minister has been no exception; in fact, he has probably been busier than a number of his predecessors.  I commend him for a recent report on the issue of cash for gold which he referred to the justice committee.  The committee will have to look at that.  From my contact with members of the Garda Síochána in my community, I have been asked by them to raise the issue of moneylending and the laws which surround it.  There is a sense among many members of the force that the legislation is not sufficiently strong and that maybe it should be examined in the near future.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I welcome this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the fall-out from the Supreme Court judgment on 23 February 2012 in a case taken against the DPP and the Attorney General for future Garda investigations into subversive and other serious crimes.  I commend the Minister for acting without delay subsequent to the shortcomings pointed out by the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court found section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to be repugnant to the Constitution, because it allowed a person who was not independent of the investigation to issue a search warrant in relation to a dwelling.  Section 29(1) permitted a superintendent to issue a warrant where he or she was satisfied that evidence of, or relating to, the commission or intended commission, of an offence scheduled for the purpose of Part V of the 1939 Act, such as firearms and explosives offences or a small number of other serious offences, was to be found.  This situation did not require the superintendent to be independent of the investigation.I appreciate the balance that the Minister seeks in this Bill and I believe that the distinctions it creates between a search warrant issued by a member of An Garda Síochána and that of a District Court judge reflect the importance of the matter at hand.  The fact that a warrant issued by An Garda Síochána lasts just 48 hours while that of a District Court judge lasts one week, and that a warrant issued by An Garda Síochána has an associated report on its creation, reflects the way we want to go and underlines the importance of the administration of justice in accordance with our Constitution.  The separation of powers is important and that is underlined in this Bill.I am happy the Minister has achieved the correct balance and maintains the integrity and independence of any criminal investigations from a procedural perspective, while also recognising that there are instances where urgency is required.  The timeframe allowed and the requirement to outline the reasons in report form for the granting of a search warrant by a Garda superintendent not associated with the criminal investigation allow operational matters and the day to day work of both An Garda Síochána and the DPP to continue.I understand there are other people availing of this Supreme Court judgment and are in the process of appealing their convictions.  This is regrettable but understandable.  This legislation cannot be applied retrospectively and I hope that convictions secured would not be thrown out by what is or was in essence a procedural matter.  This is an issue upon which I have no doubt the courts will once again be called to adjudicate.In conclusion, I welcome the Bill as updating that which has been in place for a long number of years without a proper review.  I also note the Minister has instructed his officials to conduct a general review of search powers.  It is my understanding that this review will be informed by the forthcoming Law Reform Commission report on search warrants.  I welcome this approach by the Minister and look forward to further debates in the House on the matter of search powers in due course.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I am happy to speak on this important Bill and to support it.  Like many others in this House, we have observed the need for improvement in legislation to deal with the ever increasing volume of serious crime.  There is a need for good practice and the recognition of the accused to have their constitutional and human rights respected.  The degree to which institutions of the State deviate from good practice can itself be the very instrument used to undermine the case being made, even though that may be made in the best interests of the State and the protection of its citizens.  It is one of those peculiar anomalies that we must respect at all times.I have always been an advocate for robust application of the law, particularly in so far as organised criminal gangs are concerned.  They have grown and gone from strength to strength over the past ten or 15 years.  They are spreading their wings into the wider community and are seeking out vulnerable members of society who may be vulnerable for reasons of economic difficulty, or substance abuse, or whatever.  These people are being used to promote and extend the crime barons' field of activity.  The sad part is that these people pay the price.  The crime barons do not seem to be caught out to the same extent.  It is not new to this jurisdiction or to adjoining jurisdictions.  It is not new to the administration of justice globally.  It is just one of those things that seems to happen.  Arising from the judgment that brings us to focus on this Bill, I hope that a special effort can be made in future to ensure that not only do the direct perpetrators pay the price for serious crime, but that the "Fagins" who promote and benefit from this behind the scenes receive their just punishment in the same way as the fools they use to commit their crimes.The criminal world is becoming more sophisticated in terms of technology and technique.  They have spread their communications across the globe.  In turn, this presents a huge threat to governments and the institutions of states, and a huge threat to the efficacy of the administration of justice.  We need to be aware of that and we have to balance that against the need to recognise the rights of the individual, even when accused.  Our observance of their rights will in turn determine the strength of the case ultimately proffered against them.  Recognition and due regard should also be had for the rights and entitlements of the person in prison.  Those rights are the same because the State has now a duty of care to ensure the rules and regulations are applied so it is not brought into disrepute for failing to apply them.

#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	385	It is an honour for me to attempt, for the first time ever, to make a change to legislation by bringing in this Bill.  I thank the Technical Group for supporting me and, most importantly, I thank the group Save Our National Schools, or www.sons.ie, as they call themselves.  They have done a massive amount of work on this and I hope it will not turn out to be a waste of time.The purpose of the Bill is to make specific provision in law to protect schools which, by virtue of providing education to a geographical, cultural, religious or non-denominational community, or to a recognised Gaeltacht area or offshore island, are of such importance that their closure would result in a harmful impact upon that community or area.  In a nutshell, the Bill is intended, first, to strengthen the right of children to appropriate and adequate education.  One of the requirements is that we do not ask a teacher to teach seven or eight different curricula at the one time.  Second, it is intended to strengthen the rights of teachers with regard to multi-grade teaching arrangements as, similarly, it is not fair to expect teachers to teach that many different curricula as it puts too much pressure on and is not fair to the children.  The Bill also aims to ensure that educational planning is undertaken on a proactive basis which is not based upon the enrolment of any one year but is rather based upon demographic trends established over a number of years.  The idea behind this is that at the end of a school year principals will not be scrambling around trying to find any spare child in the area, as they will know well in advance what needs to be done.For years, we have had an erosion of small schools and, as a result, the identity of an area is lost forever.  This erosion was accelerated in the last budget.  I wish to copperfasten the future of these schools through legislation which will compel the Government to think again.The main point that I predict will be thrown against this Bill is that we are in an economic crisis.  There are times when I wonder if the Government actually realises we read the newspapers.  We know there is an economic crisis so, please, do not say that to me.  We are well aware of it, so fair enough on that one.  In an economic crisis, however, why make it worse by thrashing our best assets?  It does not make sense.  It is suggested that for every €1 spent on primary education, we get €5 back.  I do not believe there is anywhere out there bar Greece, if someone bought its bonds, that would give back those yields.  However, I believe we would get more back from education than Greece at the end of the day.One of the best descriptions of the importance of small rural schools comes from the broadcaster Olivia O'Leary, a past pupil of a rural primary school in County Carlow.  She speaks sense, this lady, or she did in the last couple of weeks anyway.  I heard it on one of her radio columns on RTE Radio 1's "Drivetime" programme.  She put it beautifully when she said:One of the most precious things you can give a child is a sense of place.  Civic pride, responsible citizenship, community involvement are all nurtured by the fact that you have a stake in a place and no matter where you go, its map is imprinted on your heart.Let us hope for our children's sake that nobody takes that map away from them.  They are trying to take it away from them and they are threatening their sense of place.This Bill on its own will not achieve anything - I have no problem with saying that.  It must be done in tandem with a real plan for the development of rural Ireland.  This is as much for the sake of urban Ireland as for rural Ireland because there is limited cash available and if one area is not working to its best, this will affect another area.  These schools are the seeds of this future.  Once these unique seeds are lost, they will be gone forever.Only last week, a school called Mantua national school in Roscommon disappeared off the face of the earth, and with it the identity of that area forever.  Mantua - just think of the name.  The first person I met from Mantua came into my secondary school.  We were marvelling over it, asking "Where is this place, Mantua?", because it sounded like something from another country or another world.  That is what we have in Ireland - we have such variety that even places only six or seven miles down the road seem exotic.  They will not seem exotic if they do not exist any more.In his speech on the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion on small schools in February, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, stated: "In recent years [rural schools and rural areas] have been threatened, not by overt political action but [by] the ever increasing trend towards urbanisation on all five continents."  I do not agree with this statement.  It is inaction on the development of a sustainable local economy for rural Ireland that has led to its depopulation.  It is inaction on the development of real local democracy, in which people can make decisions for themselves, that has led to depopulation.  It is the massive inequality in single farm payments, which go to people such as the Goodmans as opposed to the small family farms, that has led to depopulation.  This does not happen by accident.  When the Minister speaks about trends, he should remember he has a massive influence that can change such trends.  Trends do not happen by magic or some omnipotent being making decisions.  We the people decide.The decisions made by the Government at budget time yet again influenced the trend to drive people further into urban areas.  I know the majority of my childhood neighbours left our town because they had no choice, not because of a trend.  Pretty much every one of them would like to return given half the chance.  Ireland is a multi-patterned cloth of a country which is slowly but surely being denuded of its colour and variety.  That is a not a good development.  From now on, instead of asking why would one need a school for a small population, we need to ask why is there such a small population in the first place.

#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am delighted to speak on the Education (Amendment)(Protection of Schools) Bill 2012, which I wholeheartedly welcome.The future of our schools is an integral and national issue which in one way or another affects us all.  It is essential our children receive the quality education they deserve to set them on the right path for their futures, as well as the future of this country.  Not only that, it is integral that schools serve the specific cultural, religious, geographical or non-denominational needs of the community they serve.  This ensures their education is in line with the values, beliefs and needs of a particular community which should not be denied.We are awaiting the publication of the long awaited value for money review of small schools being conducted by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has reiterated how small schools cannot be immune from the changes that are taking place in the public service and that they will have to work with fewer resources.  Thirty eight small schools have had their appeals provisionally upheld by the appeals board, subject to confirmation their actual enrolments in September 2012 reach the required level.  There are 84 schools in Donegal alone with four teachers or less.  As with most matters, it is the rural community which will suffer the most.  These measures would undoubtedly have catastrophic consequences in Donegal leading to closures all over the county, as well as in other rural communities across the country.  This is why I welcome that this Bill provides for educational planning to be undertaken on a proactive basis.  Instead of being based upon the enrolment of any one year, it will rather be based upon demographic trends established over several years.While the Department's report earlier this year stated there is no significant relationship between school size and the quality of teaching, learning and assessment in schools, this report does not look at the whole picture.  Small schools are already accustomed to multi-grade teaching.  However, there is a deep concern the amalgamation of schools due to closures would lead to an unsustainable multi-grade arrangement based on enrolment figures.  The proposed measures would, accordingly, deny children the right to an appropriate and adequate education, not only regarding quality of education, but also their right to receive an education in accordance with specific values and beliefs within a reasonable geographical distance.  This Bill provides for that, particularly in strengthening the rights of teachers with regard to multi-grade teaching arrangements.I find interesting a recent intervention by a Unionist politician in the British Parliament over the issue of cuts to Protestant schools.  Lord Kilclooney has raised the issue in the House of Lords where he asked whether the Irish Government is complying with its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement with its proposals to curtail financial support for Protestant schools.  This needs to be examined.Perhaps most significantly in this Bill is the protection of small schools in Gaeltacht areas and offshore islands, many of which are located in Donegal.  Without these provisions, there would be a harmful impact upon the Donegal Gaeltacht and the islands.  Section 3 places an obligation on the Minister to ensure the continued operation of a school that is the exclusive provider of education for a geographical, cultural, religious or non-denominational community or for a recognised Gaeltacht or island community.  Section 4 provides that a school will not be closed due to a lack of funding for teachers.  Section 6 provides that no teacher will have to teach any more than four curricula at any one time.  This ensures a school cannot drop below the minimum requirement of teachers.We have obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and indeed under the Good Friday Agreement to provide for an education for our young people.  The Government has to recognise these obligations and step up to the mark in maintaining these standards and providing for all the children of the nation.Today, at the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the committee heard from the Donegal islands that are threatened with ongoing fishing bans that mean that the islanders cannot provide work for themselves.  There is no use resolving these issues if they will not be able to provide an education in their own community for their children.  There needs to be a holistic approach to rural life.  Life and survival are difficult enough in rural Ireland with emigration, threats to traditional employment and now the threat to schools.  This Government should be providing for children maintaining diversity and contributing to a flourishing of rural life, not undermining people's ability to bring up their families in rural areas.Combined with the cuts to enrolment numbers and teachers, many rural communities are facing difficulties in transporting their children to school as well.  The Department does not recognise the parish basis to many rural communities and instead forces children to travel to different parishes to attend school where they may have no connection.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  All our children should be educated as closely as possible to their communities.  A small Gaeltacht school in Meenamara, County Donegal, was forced to close last week.  Children now will be bussed outside of their parish to attend a school which the Department describes as their nearest school.  This does not recognise the connections the community has to its parish, however.  This Bill attempts to address this and provide focused planning in school provision.I commend the Bill to the House.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I too am delighted to speak on this Private Members' Bill and commend my Independent colleagues for putting this Bill before the House.  I also commend them for meeting the various action groups, parents' groups, school communities and even farming organisations across the country, all of which are concerned about the impact of these disastrous cuts on rural Ireland.  A small school in a rural community is probably the last bastion of what was a vibrant community.  We had the co-operative societies which started off small and local but turned into large conglomerates.  What happened is they went abroad, invested hugely, lost their shirts, abandoned the communities from which they came and closed the creameries.  Garda stations in rural areas are being closed.  Scant regard is given to the delivery of broadband services in rural areas despite several promises of its roll out.Over the past several years much progress was made in upgrading many rural schools which got significant buy-in from parents and the wider community.  Funds were raised through voluntary efforts to ensure rural schools were upgraded and building facilities improved.  The CLÁR programme provided funding for play areas.  Now, however, the Government is going to throw the baby out with the bathwater by closing many of the schools in question.  It is reckless waste.However, considering the already reckless waste of the public service and Governments, this is nothing new to official Ireland which does not understand the value of money.  The upgrading of these facilities received much buy-in in communities which one may not have in urban areas.  I am not trying to be "urban against rural" but I am standing up for rural Ireland.  I am sick and tired of the attacks on rural Ireland.  To hell or to Connacht is a sentiment prevalent in official Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, should understand that sentiment.  Officialdom feels it is easier to cut out small rural areas and divide and conquer them.  After closing a school, it will promise a bus service for the pupils to the next school which is later removed.  CIE also threatens to remove school bus services because road conditions in rural areas are bad, roads which are neglected by central Government and cannot be fixed by local authorities due to lack of funding.  Are we going to close the gates on rural Ireland and abandon it?  People will not accept this.  Thousands of citizens came to the Dáil last November to protest and hundreds of others have attended meetings throughout the country in the meantime.  These individuals know that if a school is closed, an entire area can die.  Agriculture will be badly affected by what is proposed because no farmer will be able to get someone to marry him and settle down in a rural area.  This is due to the fact that people will not live in such areas if they are going to be obliged to drive six, eight or ten miles on dreadful roads to get their children to school.  We have been promised buses to transport children to school but these have not been forthcoming.I advise the Minister of State to go back to the drawing board.  He should consider where waste exists in his Department.  It is certainly not in small schools.  The most brilliant of people have been educated in such schools.  The Minister of State should read Alice Taylor's To School Through the Fields.  People who were educated in small schools have gone on to become world leaders and major entrepreneurs.  Those are the type of individuals we need.Children should not be made to attend school in the concrete jungles of towns and cities and thereby miss out on understanding nature and its flora and fauna.  Those who attend small rural schools witness nature at first hand and come to understand it.  They do not believe that money just comes out of a hole in the wall or that milk and potatoes are produced in factories.  These children understand nature and life.  They love their communities and are part of them.  Each Sunday they are to be found in local community fields taking part in sporting and other activities.Many communities to not have rooms in which people can meet, with the exception of those in areas where the boards of management of local schools will allow them access to their facilities.  Coláiste Cois Siúire in my parish has been operating for 21 years in the local national school.  The Minister of State should ensure such schools are put to use rather than being closed up for three to four months each year.  They should be used every afternoon and evening as educational centres for all.  These schools should not be locked up while communities are trying to fund recreation, enterprise and community centres.  Schools, as facilities, can be enhanced by the efforts of local communities and boards of management.  Sufficient money has never been provided for developments of the type to which I refer but people have always managed to make up the difference themselves.I am of the view that what is being done is dastardly.  What is happening now also occurred in my area in 1969 and the local community never recovered.  All the children there were, literally, shoved into a big school.  As a result, the old school buildings were allowed go to waste.  The problem with the buildings that are now being allowed to go to waste is that massive funding has been provided for them.  They are magnificent buildings which would have lasted a long time and which would have provided students, teachers and local communities with a small degree of comfort.  Do we want these buildings to be abandoned, as happened in the case of the creameries and the Garda stations?I was present at a community event at the Commons in Ballingarry on Saturday last.  It was held at an old school which had been closed but which was reopening following a refurbishment that was completed on foot of the provision of funding by the local community and through the Leader programme.  It now serves as a community centre.  Are we going to turn all our schools into such centres?  I do not believe so because we will not have people with the relevant expertise and a passion for rural life.  We do not have the wherewithal, pride, dignity or self-respect to ensure this will happen.  The Minister of State should know from the experience in his own area that it is a case of ní neart go chur le chéile.  An approach based on the philosophy of divide and conquer will not succeed.

I commend Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan and the Technical Group on bringing it forward.  I pay tribute to parents, teachers and others in the Save Our National Schools group who are involved in the campaign to ensure small schools, regardless of whether they are located in Gaeltacht or rural areas or on the islands, are retained.  Many such schools are also to be found in towns and cities.  I pay particular tribute to Breda Fitzgerald, principal of Newtown Upper national school near Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary, who has been doing Trojan work in respect of this matter in recent months.The Bill before the House is designed to protect small schools which, by virtue of providing education to a geographical, cultural, religious or non-denominational community, to a recognised Gaeltacht area and or to an offshore island, are of such importance that their closure would result in a harmful impact upon that community or area.  It is also designed to strengthen the right of children to appropriate and adequate education and also the rights of teachers in the context of multi-grade teaching arrangements.  This legislation is both timely and worthwhile, especially in light of the serious cuts that were announced in the budget.One of the important matters with which the Bill deals is teacher numbers in rural schools.  Using the number of children enrolled in the September of the previous year as a basis for deciding the teaching complement has given rise to serious problems for small schools over the years.  The position is particularly difficult this year as a result of the cuts introduced in the budget.  It is essential that a new criterion for deciding upon the number of teachers to be employed in small rural schools be put in place.  The method put forward in this regard in the Bill would certainly be a good option.As previous speakers and I have already stated, small schools effectively were targeted for cuts in the budget.  These schools are the heart and soul of rural, village, island and Gaeltacht communities.  The effect of the cuts to which I refer will be the forced amalgamation of small schools over a period.  This will lead to many such schools in rural areas being closed.  When the cuts were introduced, no account was taken of the way teachers in smalls schools operate.  I refer to teachers who take a number of classes across the spectrum containing children of all abilities, to staff who provide for students with special needs, and to resource teachers.  The payback in terms of giving people a good education is massive, in both the short and the longer term.  As Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan stated, the payback in respect of every €1 is €5.  In the long term, the level of this payback is even greater.I am sure that, as has happened in the past, we will be informed by the Minister of State that money is tight and the resources are not available.  I have stated on previous occasions - those on the Government benches do not want to listen to what I have to say in this regard - that this is an extremely wealthy country.  There are huge amounts of money in the hands of very wealthy people.  I refer here to the super-rich.  These individuals have both significant incomes and assets.  Independent reports from the Central Statistics Office and Credit Suisse show that the wealthiest 5% of people in this country own €239 billion worth of assets.  A recent survey by the Central Statistics Office also shows that during the course of the recession, 90% of people have lost income.  This is to be expected.  In addition, some 25% of people have lost a significant amount of income.  There is, of course, the 10% of people identified in the survey to which I refer who have actually increased the level of both their incomes and assets during the course of this most serious recession.  These individuals do not pay any wealth or assets tax.  It is time the Government obliged extremely wealthy people with significant assets and incomes to pay.  These individuals must not be allowed to freeload on the backs of middle and low income earners.  Effectively, the latter are paying the taxes the super-wealthy should be paying.Significant moneys can be taxed through wealth and assets taxes to ensure these schools are properly funded and resourced.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	390	Small rural schools provide one of the most vital services and are severely under threat in these difficult times.  Some 18 such schools in my constituency are under the threshold for potential cuts and in danger of losing teachers in the coming years.  This is taking place in a country in which 80% of people are without a third level education qualification and the rate of youth unemployment stands at 28.5%.  It is scandalous that the Government is continuing a concerted policy of viewing small schools as liabilities instead of as assets.  That is the view of many.  The level of disadvantage children in peripheral rural communities face is being compounded by ongoing cutbacks and increases in the pupil-teacher ratio which directly affect the quality of education students receive.  All independent bodies have stated this and that we are reaching the stage where, in 2012, the education of our children is being affected.  We should carefully ponder this point.  On a number of occasions the troika has stated it does not wish to see cuts in education because of the potential to create jobs.  The more educated a person is, the better his or her chance of finding a job.  It is deplorable that we do not have the foresight to see the long-term damage we are doing to our children's education through cuts in education, particularly in small schools.Parents are angry at the Government and scared for the future of their children.  The Save our National Schools campaign is gathering momentum across the country as the gravity of the cuts hits parents.  They are not prepared to see €140 million hacked from the education budget for next year, with a possible further €220 million over two years after that.  The Minister must be aware of the anticipated surge in enrolments.  By 2018, an extra 70,000 children will demand to be educated, but it will be impossible to provide it if we cut back on the numbers of teachers and small schools.  The number of children in primary school is expected to surge by 45,000, while there will be 25,000 more students at post-primary level.  These statistics support what I have always said, that quality of life in a country will always be judged by its health service and education system.  How do we expect the country to thrive in the future if we cut back on education levels?  It will not happen.  We are on course for disaster if we think that, by saving a few hundred million euro now and denying a substantial number of children the education they deserve, we will benefit the country in years to come.I have met many school principals and they are open to discussing alternatives.  Alternative measures to cut costs include pooling resources, sharing secretaries and administrative duties.  Many schools have spoken about these options and operating in clusters, an option which has been discussed in Waterford.I draw the attention of the Minister to the success of small schools in Finland, for instance.  He should examine the history of education in there, where the government opted to rationalise the administration and management of small schools in remote areas without closing one school.  This took place during a downturn.  Scandinavian countries are held up as models for educational success and regularly top international school league tables for basic skills.  They have not closed a single school.  Perhaps the Minister might explore these possibilities.No child in this country is to blame for the financial mess we are in.  This point should sink in to every Member.  By refusing to acknowledge the importance of small schools and the relationship with the local community, the Government has given the go-ahead for the piecemeal corrosion of a family friendly, community-based and valuable model of education.  If the Minister speaks to people in the know and at the coalface, teachers will tell him that children's education has been affected by the cutbacks made in recent years.  This cannot be a good indication for the future of the country.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Technical Group for allowing me speaking time.  I also thank Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan and his excellent staff for the work they have done in bringing this Bill before Dáil Éireann.Given the importance of this debate, particularly for rural Deputies, it is disappointing that I am talking to the Minister of State and only one Deputy on the Government side.  Where is everyone else?  This is an extremely important issue.  The network of small schools survived in horribly bad times.  Last Saturday I was at a school which was celebrating the fact that it was 150 years in existence.  Let us think back over the 150 years and the bad times the principals and teachers at the school saw.  In times gone by children had to bring a sod of turf with them to heat the school.  That was the rule.  However, the children survived and received a good, sound and solid education in a safe environment near their homes.  It is said the country is broke, but let us compare the Ireland of today with the country of those young children.  They had no socks and shoes on their feet; they wore a pair of short raggy trousers and had a sod of turf in their hand to heat the school for the day.  The Government has choices to make.  We are aware of the situation it walked into when it took over.  However, one of the choices it is making is to attack the education system at local level by closing small schools.  Why is it doing this?  What are we saving if we close a small school?  We save on the electricity bill because teachers must be paid in other schools.  The school I attended last Saturday in Lauragh has witnessed major investment during the years by the State and by fund-raising and holding activities throughout the year.  It has a new roof and playground.  Everything is perfect in it.  Why would a Government which is supposed to be intelligent and smart and forward thinking close a school?  Governments have made stupid mistakes.  Take the time when Governments thought it was a good idea to close down the railway network.  If that infrastructure could be put back today, and those trains were rolling, taking traffic from the roads and offering scenic travel for tourists, it would be a massive boost to the economy.  Governments, however, thought it was the right thing to close down the railway networks, pull up the tracks and leave them abandoned and let them go to hell.  That was a mistake.  Now the Government wants to make the same mistake with our small schools.  When they are gone, it will be impossible to open them again and everyone will then admit that it was the wrong decision.Take the quality of teaching a young person gets in one of those schools.  It is more personal and safer.  The time a child is most vulnerable and impressionable is when he leaves his house on the first day and goes into a junior infants class.  If he is going to a place where he knows all the other students, has grown up with them and met them at mass and sports events, where he knows the teachers and everyone lives locally, it is a lovely safe atmosphere for him to go into.  If those schools are closed and amalgamated into larger schools, those lovely small children will be going into a place that will be daunting and terrifying in many cases because there will be so many other people there from different areas, people they do not know and know nothing about.  That interaction is fine further on in the educational system but at a younger age it is better for them to be nearer to home.  If a child goes to one of those schools and has a learning difficulty or a problem, it will be identified much quicker when there is a smaller group of children in the class.Children are being herded into larger classes, which the Government is achieving by changing pupil-teacher ratios and the rules on school transport.  That is how it is going to close the schools.  No one on the Government benches will stand up and say it is going to close a particular number of schools.  They are not men enough to do that.  By meddling with the rules, however, the Government will close the schools by stealth.  That is why I commend Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan on bringing this Bill before the House, so we can debate it and people on the Government side can nail their colours to the mast.  This is about a choice.  Are Government Members in favour of retaining the small school networks in the country or are they not?  If they are, they should vote for this Bill and if they oppose those schools and think it is okay to pursue a policy of closing them down, they should vote with the Government.I thank the Technical Group for introducing this Bill and I compliment SOSS, Save our Small Schools, on the great work it has done organising meetings up and down the country.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Deputy Flanagan's Bill would keep schools open even when there are not enough pupils to sustain them.  It displays a lack of awareness of funding arrangements for small schools and, worst of all, it ignores basic realities about the state of the economy.  Therefore, the Government will be opposing this Bill.We cannot begin this debate without restating the overall financial and budgetary context that Ireland is operating in.  The biggest challenge facing the Government is to step back from the edge of national insolvency.  We are working hard to ensure we can pass on to our children a country that has regained once and for all its economic independence.The House should be aware that almost 80% of the education budget goes on pay and pensions.  Members should also be aware that we must find places and teachers for the additional 70,000 pupils coming into our schools over the next six years.  Members also know that we have to reduce the numbers working in the public sector.  We simply do not have the resources available to us to maintain all our services at current levels.  The Private Members' Bill being debated here this evening is another example of how the Opposition fails to grasp this stark reality.The most recent data from my Department show that 19% of the State's 3,165 primary schools have fewer than 50 pupils and 46% have fewer than 100 pupils.  Deputies will be aware that a value for money review on small primary schools is currently being finalised in the Department.  I expect that the report of the review should be available after the summer recess.  I regret that it has not been available sooner to fully inform this debate but it has involved very detailed technical work.The review will take account of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.  Consideration is also being given to the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  Public consultations were conducted as part of the review.  A large response was received and a common theme from the submissions from the public was the important role that schools play in the social fabric of rural communities and this something that all of us are fully aware of.  When the review is published, the Minister's intention is to lay it before the Houses to give an opportunity for Deputies and Senators to have a wide ranging debate on its outcomes and proposals.On the children's rights provisions of the Bill proposed this evening, I might recall for the House that the Government signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children on 30 September 1990 and ratified it on 28 September 1992.  By ratifying the UNCRC, Ireland has committed itself to working at national level and to international measures to achieve its objectives.  For example, the principles addressed in the articles referred to in the proposed Bill are consistent with the underpinning principles of the existing legislative and policy framework in the education and training sector.  Further development of the broad policy framework will be considered as part of the planned development of a White Paper in early 2013 in the context of the Government's response to the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary school sector and also in the development of a regulatory framework for school enrolment.  Other relevant initiatives include the work being undertaken by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to develop a new children and young people's policy framework, which will succeed the previous national children's strategy.Deputies will be aware that the Government is committed to strengthening children's rights and the constitutional referendum on children scheduled for later in the year is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Given the scope and relevance of new initiatives under way across a number of Government Departments, and the fact that the convention is already binding on the State under international law, it is unnecessary to proceed with the amendments to the Education Act as proposed by Deputy Flanagan.I want to return to the central theme of this proposed legislation, which relates to the resourcing of schools, and in particular the allocation of teachers.  In February of this year, we debated the budget measures related to the teacher staffing schedule in small schools.  Deputy Flanagan is merely repeating that debate.  A third of all public sector employees in this State work in the education sector.  It is simply not possible to completely exempt staffing levels in education from the Government's need to reduce expenditure.Achieving savings in the education budget has required very difficult decisions to be made.  This is particularly the case at a time when the school-going population is increasing, and there will be more difficult decisions in the next budget and the one after.  The extremely favourable staffing provision for small schools was put in place when resources were plentiful and at a time of demographic dividend when enrolments were falling.  This is no longer possible given our budgetary constraints and rapidly rising school population.  We may wish it were otherwise but reductions in staffing numbers will continue to play a part in expenditure consolidation.The last budget included a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools but those changes were made so that we can continue to sustain small schools, rather than to close them.  The Opposition, which had been predicting wholesale closure of schools, got it wrong.  As the Opposition well knows, there are school closures or amalgamations virtually every year.  For the coming school year, five schools have indicated their intention to close; last year there were three closures and the year before there were four school closures.  This is hardly the widely predicted death of rural Ireland.  If one listened to Deputies opposite, one would conclude that we intended to padlock rural school gates up and down the country but the facts prove otherwise.The only thing that is changing for small schools from next September is that their average class size will no longer be as advantageous as they have been in the past.  It is no more and no less than that.  The schools will still exist.  It is not sustainable for the Department to continue to provide, for example, a second classroom teacher for a school that has 12 pupils, as was the case.  Could anyone honestly say that we can afford to have a staffing schedule threshold that provides for a full-time classroom teacher with an average as low as six pupils per classroom - a better ratio than applies in most classes in special schools.  Even when all of the phased increases are implemented, the threshold for a second teacher at 20 pupils will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in small schools prior to the late 1990s.  Some teachers in small schools will call for those exceptionally favourable arrangements to continue, but one could ask how fair it is to taxpayers or to their teaching colleagues in larger schools - some of whom have to teach 30 or more pupils in their classrooms.I accept that no school likes to lose a teacher and that the INTO and teachers like small classes.  However, under the Under Croke Park agreement teachers have been given certain guarantees on basic pay and no compulsory redundancy but, in return, like all other public servants, they must demonstrate flexibility.  I cannot agree with the concept being advanced by Deputy Flanagan in the Bill that some teachers should have legal rights to teach in particularly small classes.  Deputy Flanagan's argument is that teachers' rights are aligned with children's rights in regard to multi-grade classes.  The argument implicitly impugns the work of the many able teachers who have served their pupils well in such multi-grade classes over the years.  I attended a two-teacher school with a multi-grade class.  Deputy Flanagan's parliamentary assistant attended a similar school three miles from there.  Both of us received an excellent education in that environment because of the commitment and talent of the teachers involved.There are aspects of the Bill on which I accept the basic point at issue while not fully accepting the mechanism being advocated to deal with the point.  The issue of how particular enrolments are used to determine the staffing allocation is a case in point.  Earlier this year we noted arguments made by Deputies and others that since enrolment on the 30 September in the previous year determined the teacher allocation for the following September that schools due to lose a teacher might in fact have more pupils enrolled next September.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, responded by making the appeal process accessible to small schools, and in particular to those schools that were projecting increased enrolments that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts in the longer term.I do not accept the proposed linkage with the previous census as a basis for determining teacher allocation for any one year.  The measure implemented this year is more responsive, as it captures those who are expected to attend.  Census data are a snapshot in time and cannot identify those who have either left an area since the census was carried out or those that have come to live in the area more recently.  Furthermore, parents may choose to drive by the nearest school in some instances to have their children attend another school.The Department utilises a geographical information system, GIS, to analyse demographics and school enrolment data.  GIS allows the Department to conduct detailed analysis on the demographics of each part of the country, and enables the Department to model a range of forecast scenarios for each area for the coming years, and to assess the likely changes to the school-going population in those areas.  Given that the Department already uses multi-layered data sources for planning school infrastructural needs, I do not believe that the provisions of the Bill proposed by Deputy Flanagan in this regard are warranted.Public policy has historically recognised the special position of island schools that are the sole educational support to island communities.  The budget measure did not alter the special arrangements for such schools with three or fewer teachers.  Unlike most schools, in the event that a reduction in the pupil numbers of an island school will result in the loss of the second or third teacher in the school, the post may be retained subject to certain pupil retention levels.  That means that in the case of the second mainstream post the total number of pupils must be at eight or above and the school must be the only primary school remaining on the island.  In the case of all other primary schools for the coming school year the figure will be 14 pupils not eight.  In the case of the third classroom post, the total number of pupils must be at 45 or above where the school is the only primary school remaining on the island.  That compares to all other primary schools where the figure is 51 for the coming school year of 2012 to 2013.Public policy can be responsive to the needs of small schools but this must be done in a reasonable, balanced way and above all be realistic.  It is important that the staffing levels in small schools are set at an affordable and sustainable level in particular in these difficult and challenging times.  It is by doing so that we underpin the future of small schools.  Let me conclude with one simple fact.  In September, only 32 small schools out of 3,200 primary schools nationally will lose a teacher as a consequence of the budget measures.  That gives the lie to Opposition claims about small schools losing hundreds of teachers and there being some kind of supposed attack on rural areas.  Populism and rhetoric are not a solution to the challenges this country faces.

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Deputy Flanagan has warned against the point but it is crucial to debate the economic difficulties of the country at the moment.  Anyone who attended a rural school knows what an abacus is and knows that if there is more on one side than the other then things are not right.  Unfortunately, the economic difficulties are irrevocably connected to the Bill and the overall issue.  I accept that rural schools have been faced with reductions in resources.  Let us call it as it is.  However, rural schools have also benefited in ways that larger schools have not.  For example, smaller schools enjoy a significantly lower pupil-teacher ratio than larger schools.  The ratio is 28:1 on average.  I attended a school which had 44 pupils per class in the 1980s.  We have it down to 28:1 at the moment and that is to the benefit of the people of the country and to education that we keep it at that level and strive, on average, to lower it.  Reductions in teacher numbers in some rural areas have been disheartening but the current economic climate does not lend itself to continuing in the same fashion as previously.I compliment the Minister of State on his speech.  He highlighted in an articulate manner the argument for the Department of Education and Skills taking the steps it has with a view to giving an education to every member of society in an equal manner.  Some Opposition spokespersons have made worthwhile comments on protecting education in rural areas and also the need for education as one of the pathways to recovery for the country.  To reinforce the point, out of the 3,200 primary schools nationally, approximately 32 small schools will lose a teacher as a consequence of the budget measure relating to small schools.  Those 32 schools account for 1% of the total, although it is 1% that I would prefer it not to affect.  I, the Labour Party and the Government are committed to rural schools and their importance to communities across the country.We must examine rural schools using a five-prong approach, in terms of geographical, parish, sporting, transport and expenditure factors.  I cannot elaborate on that within five minutes but I have spoken to the people of Kerry at length at meetings throughout the county.  I have met parents and boards of management.  It is to the benefit of society for everyone to get a good education.  Some people to whom I spoke referred to the benefit of being in a small classroom with an excellent teacher for a number of years.  However, the corollary was also the case, which was to the detriment of some to whom I spoke.  Everyone must be entitled to a good standard of education.  I do not tell a lie when I say that I was contacted by a parent whose son was the only boy in a school with 14 pupils.  The parents believed it was not a healthy situation but that they could not remove him from the school as the other parents were afraid of the pupil-teacher ratio falling to a level that would jeopardise the school.Numerous difficult and regrettable decisions have been made and at times they have cost more than they were worth.  The budget is about trying to regain the sovereignty of the country.  I have attended public meetings and in terms of budgets I am aware that nothing we are doing is for the purpose of being popular.  I can honestly state that I am making every effort to help our country to regain its sovereignty and to return it to a position in which the pupil-teacher ratio for every child can be reduced, teachers are better and everyone looks forward to the future.  This is an unparalleled time.  It is not a recession, but a crisis.  When a country loses its independence, it has a big problem.I wish to highlight an issue.  While I am against the Bill, I bring to the attention of the House an important matter involving rural school transport in my constituency, specifically in respect of the 18 children of Abbeydorney and Ardfert who will newly attend Causeway comprehensive school in September.  They have been told they will not be provided with school transport and that there will be no room for them in the coming school year.  Many of them have siblings who attend Causeway and travel there by Bus Éireann bus.  It is expected that this issue will prevail for a prolonged period.  Schools in Tralee have told parents that, since the area's primary schools are not feeder schools for its larger schools, the pupils therefrom will not be considered.  They have been left in limbo.  Most of the pupils in question live further than 4.8 km away from their schools.  I will revert to the Department on this matter as it is not acceptable for two children from a single family to board a bus while a parent must find a new school and drive the family's third child to it.There are many complexities to the issue of rural schools and the transport thereto.  Government backbenchers will take on board any criticism, but we need constructive help if we are to solve the problem.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Let us contextualise.  The budget for the Department of Education and Skills is approximately €8 billion, four fifths of which is spent on pay and pensions.  We should not lose sight of this fact.  Many fine contributions have been made on all sides of the House.  Some members of the Opposition hold genuine opinions regarding this matter and a number of them have made good proposals on what should and, in particular, should not be done.  This is welcome, but we must bear in mind the Minister for Education and Skills has at least one hand tied behind his back.There has been a great deal of hyperbole regarding this issue.  Despite the fact we all knew the extent of the economic crisis in February 2011, there are some who choose to ignore it for their own reasons and engage in a debate that, by and large, is a sham.  The factual situation is different from what could have obtained had there been a continuation of the political chaos of late 2010 and early 2011.  We have stabilised the economy and the public finances.  There has been good news in recent weeks, not least of these being the result of the European summit talks last Friday, the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 and the renegotiation of the EU-IMF bailout agreement.  All of these were unimaginable a few short months ago.  None of the detractors has clarified the fundamental misunderstanding of and erroneous predictions about whether the Government could achieve these improvements.  While I say this in deference to people who are in trouble, let us concentrate on the task in hand and bear in mind the Government's dedication to this matter.I have a number of issues with Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan's Bill, but I do not want to take away from his good intentions.  Section 2 seeks to include the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Education Act, but the section is poorly drafted, given that Ireland ratified the convention, without reservation, in 1992.  There is no doubting the Government's commitment to children's rights, not least because the referendum on same will be held later this year.  The scope and relevance of the new initiatives under way across a wide variety of Departments render this section redundant.Several months ago, the House debated a robust appeals process.  As a result of a slight increase in the enrolment threshold, 73 small schools were due to lose one teacher each next September.  When the Department of Education and Skills gave them the opportunity to appeal the decision, 62 schools did so.  The primary staffing appeals board assessed their applications and decided provisionally to approve the appeals of 41 schools.  As such, a total of 32 small schools out of a total of 3,100 primary schools will lose one teacher each next September as a result of the budget measure.  It gives me no satisfaction to point out that they only equate to 1%, but we need to put the situation in context.  While the loss of the posts will undoubtedly cause difficulties, it is a far cry from the decimation of rural Ireland as predicted inside and outside the Chamber at budget time.Section 4 ignores the fact that small schools benefit from significantly enhanced funding arrangements.  All schools are provided with minimum capitation payments based on 60 pupils, regardless of actual numbers.  Any sensible person would acknowledge this.  Small schools incur fixed costs, which are reflected in the arrangement, and the section has no basis in reality.Five schools have indicated their intention to close in the coming school year.  Three schools closed last year and four closed the previous year.  The idea that the Government is singling out small schools is mistaken.I began my contribution by referring to the four fifths of the Minister's budget.  We must bear in mind that they are protecting the jobs and salaries of the people working in the sector.  The budget is not intended to serve the needs of wage militants.  Let us focus the debate on what is right for the children.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis chun labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  I attended a small rural primary school in Drinagh many moons ago and taught in a small school in Leap in County Cork as well as in a number of other schools.  I was the principal of a small rural school in Skibbereen before entering political life.  During my time as principal, I was acutely aware of the job's responsibilities.  As a public representative, I am once again conscious of those responsibilities.Priorities are all important and it would be remiss of me not to mention that I was reminded of them last weekend, which I spent in my home town of Clonakilty where flooding caused devastation and cost many people their businesses and homes.  It would not take long for such an event to refocus one's mind on the real priorities.  As a public representative, I have a responsibility to stand up and be counted.  It is easy to be against everything and for nothing, but there is a job of work to be done and I am passionate about being honest with people.  They will get a chance to have their say on me in a few years' time.I believe in menu option politics.  We cannot be against everything.  We must stand up and consider the lesser of all evils.  My priority in education, the area about which I am most passionate, is and always has been the provision of resources to children with special needs.  Every opportunity I have to speak on educational matters, I plead with the Minister and Minister of State to continue protecting resources in this regard.  I acknowledge the resources that have been provided to date to the most vulnerable children in the education system.My primary focus in this debate is the child.  I do not mean to be smart, as I have a great deal of respect for many of Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan's opinions on this matter, but the Bill lacks an emphasis on the child.  School buildings, communities, teachers' conditions and so on receive more emphasis.  The child and what is best for him or her must be at the heart of this debate.  There is a difference between better educational practice and best educational practice.  The best practice is to have no more than two curriculum streams in any single classroom and to have no more than two classes per teacher.  Anything more would dilute best educational practice.Deputy Spring referred to children's social skills.  Team sports and learning are important, but a variety of teachers in a building is a necessity.  Teachers matter, not the school.  A minimum of four teachers teaching eight classes is the maximum.  I am passionate in this regard.There is no such thing as a bad school or a good school, but there is such a thing as an underperforming teacher.  In many cases a teacher may be underperforming and parents are correct if they are not happy for their child to have the same teacher for four years.  That is far from ideal and not what we should be seeking in future.  This is an opportunity for schools to consider the future of education.Many parishes in my constituency have two or three different schools competing for resources and students, and parents are exercising choice in moving children to different schools depending on the teachers available.  I want to see us grasping the nettle and looking ahead at the future provision of education for our children.  We must consolidate rural education.  If the position continues where each school is fighting for students and limited resources, they will all choke eventually and there will be no rural education.  If all the rural schools close we will have to go to schools in towns.  I want to ensure we can retain rural education.  If two or three schools in a five-mile radius are struggling, they can consider how to provide the best education for children in future.It is foolhardy to speak about the decimation of rural Ireland.  I was a teacher in 1996 and the figures that will be achieved at the end of these changes to the pupil-teacher ratio are the same as those achieved when I was teaching.  Those were not bizarre teaching conditions and we were not in the dark ages; it was the recent past.  Having 20 students and two teachers, a ratio of 10:1, is hardly unfair or unjustified at this time.  There is an example of a school in my constituency that has a teacher with the three classes of junior infants, senior infants and first class and a total of 34 students.  Three miles up the road a school has two teachers and 17 students, with one teacher having eight students.  There is something wrong in that case and the Constitution cherishes all our children equally.The child and educational welfare must be at the heart of this debate.  As a parent and educator, I believe the limited resource pool of teachers must be applied evenly and fairly across the board to every student.  Having one teacher with six or seven students in one room and another teacher with up to 36 students in another room is unfair, inequitable and it cannot continue.  Such a process is not in the best interests of the child in the classroom.  I will be voting in the best interests of all our children.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  The protection of small schools is critical, and I know the Save Our National Schools, SONS, campaign, including Billy Standish and his colleagues, has done good work in creating awareness of the difficulties that will face many communities with the gradual implementation of the staffing schedule changes.On many occasions I stated clearly that the 2012 budget unfairly targeted rural communities.  The Government's plans to introduce staffing cuts in small schools with fewer than five teachers will result in many communities losing their local schools.  In the decade leading up to 2011 there was a very substantial and welcome increase in resources provided to small schools, including a major increase that almost doubled personnel.  That policy was implemented by previous Governments because we valued the critical role of the small school in the local community, and it contributed to rural regeneration.Local primary schools are an irreplaceable part of community life.  The network of schools with fewer than four teachers must be protected.  In January this year, I moved a Private Members' motion on behalf of Fianna Fáil outlining very clearly the need to support and protect small schools and for the Government to reverse its decision to introduce the new, discriminatory staffing schedules.In the past six months the cuts being imposed in our schools have rightly become the cause of concern to many school communities.  I attended a meeting in west Cavan last Sunday morning where I expected to meet a deputation of six to eight people but the local parish hall was full of people from the wider community.  Those in attendance included parents and people with no children attending the school but who were interested in their community.  These people value the service provided by the school and are worried that a rural parish will be left without a school.  A number of decades ago there were six schools in the parish but the people are worried that the lone school will face closure over the next few years.  There is much angst and concern among the people of Glangevlin, where the school in question is Curravagh, and it was evident to me and the other public representatives who attended.It is true we have a high number of primary schools in proportion to population.  That is the result of many factors, including our population dispersal pattern and, more importantly, the role of primary school as a focal point in the local community.  The community school link is a core feature of our society and we must continue to retain that link.  These schools help maintain the viability of many rural areas and taking away the school in a community removes the community's heart and future.The previous Minister responsible for education matters commenced the value for money review on the provision of small primary schools mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  The main approach in the review was to find the best way of supporting those schools.  I understand that review will not be published until after the summer but it should have been published before staffing schedule changes were made and included consultation with relevant unions and management bodies.  Was any impact analysis carried out in the Department?  It would appear not.  Small schools received a stark message from the Department when they were advised "to consider their future" and "to assess their options for amalgamation".It is clear that the changes are blunt in nature and the forced cuts are based on numbers alone, without any consideration for school ethos, the geography of an area or the impact on a community of removing such a key amenity.  These cuts will have a disproportionate and severe impact on minority faith schools, such as Church of Ireland schools and gaelscoileanna.  This policy is completely at odds with the Minister's stated intention of widening patronage.  I outlined in this House previously that there are 200 Protestant primary schools in the State, with 65% of Church of Ireland schools affected by these changes.  A Church of Ireland minister recently wrote:Many of our schools in rural Ireland are small schools located in dispersed and isolated rural areas.  The changes in pupil-teacher ratio means that it will become virtually impossible for many small schools to function due to staffing cuts and these draconian austerity measures will seriously undermine the Irish education system that has been built so well up to now.The decision to introduce phased adjustments at primary level in 2012 to staff schedules for schools with between one and four teachers will lead to a dramatic increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in rural primary schools, leading in turn to large numbers of closures and amalgamations.  I have the privilege of representing in this House two of the southern Ulster counties.  Within the community of minority churches, there is widespread concern that there are serious difficulties in trying to retain those schools.  That must be addressed.Decisions on staffing levels cannot just be about value for money and achieving savings.  Research has indicated that children do well in these schools, and the social and emotional development of children in small schools is stronger.  There is also greater parental involvement in small schools, with communities and parents getting actively involved in school activities.  This was evident at the meeting I described in the parish in my county last Sunday, as the entire community was in the parish hall expressing concern about the future of the local school.Multigrade and multi-class teaching has its challenges but there are considerable learning positives to grouping children of different ages and grades.  The Department statistics indicate that approximately 40% of all primary school pupils are taught in multi-class situations.  Even in a one-grade class there is always a considerable range of abilities, maturity and needs.  No two children can be considered as being at the same level in all areas.  The small school provides a sense of belonging where each child is valued for his or her unique abilities.  Multi-class teaching brings together children of different ages and development.  International studies show that the outcomes for children in small schools are on a par with, if not better than, larger schools.  Studies in our country have the same conclusions.It is not true to claim that there would be a gradual increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in small schools.  These changes will represent a large increase.  For example, a Gaeltacht scoil will now need 83 pupils instead of 76 pupils to qualify for four teachers this year.  The new retention figures published by the Department are inequitable.  A large school with 12 teachers needs a further 28 pupils to become a 13 teacher school.  However, a two teacher school that seeks to become a three teacher school this September will need an additional 37 pupils and a three teacher school seeking to become a four teacher school will need an additional 30 pupils.  Why are small schools punished compared to larger schools?  These new retention figures will make it more difficult for small schools to expand.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh an Bhille seo agus ba mhaith liom an Grúpa Teicniúil a mholadh as ucht an Bhille seo a chur os comhair an Tí anocht.. The Minister's actions last Christmas show his value system.  He hit urban DEIS 1 programme schools with one hand and then he hit small rural schools with the other, but advantaged larger schools were left unscathed as a result of the decisions taken by the Minister.  He made these decisions without any policy analysis, or, if he has a policy analysis, he has not made it clear except for one policy, that is, he wants small schools to amalgamate.I find this extraordinary because he made those decisions while a value for money audit was going on in his Department.  He did not decide to meet the requirements of one year's budget although he could have done this by spreading the burden throughout the school system.  He could have made the savings in this small way.  Instead he made the decision for four years without reference to the value for money audit.  The Minister does not actually know the value he will get for whatever savings he believes he will get because he has not received the report yet.  This is bizarre decision making of the highest order.The Department is meant to refer to outputs.  The new buzz word in the Estimates process is "outputs".  However, the Department was oblivious to outputs when it made this decision.  As my colleague pointed out, these schools have been shown to work time and again.  In other words, if one puts in the money, one gets the results at the end of the chain.  Irrespective of parents' backgrounds, a phenomenal level of these children either go on to a trade or third level education.  If we are to consider value for money, surely we should accept that the idea of education is to give young people choice in life.  Instead, this is what the children of the small schools of Ireland get.A greater issue is at stake, that is, the community.  Many people do not understand the value of a community because they cannot measure it or see it.  Having grown up in the city and then moved to a small rural community, I can testify to the great benefit to the country, urban and rural, of a strong community.  I am keen for us to put more effort into building up communities within urban areas where there are high levels of social deprivation.  Only in the building up of communities will we find a solution to our problems.  This can only occur where there are strong communities and a togetherness and where there is a seamless totality between the wider community of parents, teachers and pupils, all of whom belong to a community where supports are in place.  They can work and yield tangible results for the children who emerge from these schools.  However, they may decide none of it is worthwhile because the Minister has a principled objection to rural Ireland and small schools.There are many things I could say about this issue.  I support the comments of my colleague on Protestant schools.  It is extraordinary that we are debating this issue on the day a signal event took place in Seanad Éireann, that is, when the Grand Master of the Orange Order addressed the House.  He levelled one criticism against this State.  He said many things had happened and changed for the better.  He specified in particular things that happened under the previous Government.  The one black mark he mentioned, however, was the decimation of what he saw as the small Protestant communities along the Border.This is a country where reconciliation and peace have been achieved and where there has been a great emphasis on building links between all communities to make everyone feel they are a part of the State and cherished.  Despite this, the Government seems to be hell-bent on trying to alienate a community that passionately wants to be fully part of our State but believes it is now being acted against in a discriminatory way.  Ansin, tagaimid chuig an Ghaeltacht.  Tá an Rialtas ag rá go bhfuil sé chun an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, go bhfuil sé ag seasamh léi agus go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht thar a bheith tábhachtach.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit, bhí mé thiar leis i Leitir Mealláin, agus tá a fhios aige go bhfuil na scoileanna beaga Gaeltachta riachtanach do thodhchaí na teanga agus go bhfuil sé níos fusa sna scoileanna beaga an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú mar theanga scoile.  Chomh maith leis sin, sna ceantair atá ar imeall na Gaeltachta, má dhéantar iarracht comhnascadh a dhéanamh, is é an Béarla a bheidh in uachtar, ní hí an Ghaeilge.  Na hiarrachtaí móra atá á ndéanamh ag daoine sna ceantair ina bhfuil meascan gasúr le Gaeilge agus gan Ghaeilge ag dul ar scoil, scriosfar ar fad iad.  Ach is cuma leis an Rialtas.  Níl aon údar aige cén fáth go bhfuil sé seo á dhéanamh.I ask one final thing of the Minister of State.  I have disagreed with what has been done since the beginning.  I believe the decisions made for this year were wrong.  I know that the issue of the school in Inis Meáin was raised with the Minister of State in the Seanad last week.  It is a scandal that there will be eight pupils in that island school but the Department will not allow the second teacher to remain although they agreed to give up all the learning support hours.  I call on the Minister of State to put the remainder of this four year plan into abeyance until we see the value for money report.  We should have an opportunity to debate the report and examine it in detail at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education so that we can test absolutely whether the policies are being followed by the Department in the interests of the children of the country or whether they are simply Civil Service decisions endorsed by the Minister which have taken no account of the sociological, social and educational effects of young children in rural Ireland.

Tá an-taithí agam ar an bhfadhb seo.  Thug mé cuairt ar an méid sin scoileanna i gContae na Mí agus i gContae na hIarmhí agus tá faitíos an domhain ar mhuintir na tuaithe faoin mbeartas atá an Rialtas seo ag cur i bhfeidhm.  Tá mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí Seán Crowe agus Pearse Doherty, le caint faoi na gnáthscoileanna beaga amárach ach ba mhaith liom díriú isteach ar na scoileanna Gaeltachta.Is scoileanna beaga iad formhór na scoileanna Gaeltachta, rud a chuireann sa bhearna bhaoil iad sa chóras nua atá á chur i bhfeidhm.  Deirtear go bhfuil trí oide nó níos lú in 70% de na scoileanna beaga.Tá na scoileanna seo lárnach do oideachas na bpáistí atá cóngarach dóibh.  Cosúil leis na gnáth scoileanna, tá siad tábhachtach ó thaobh láidreacht an phobail.  Tá siad mar chroí atá ag preabadh i gceantair iargúlta atá tar éis an-chuid a fhulaingt.  Ceantair iad a chaill daoine don imirce agus a chaill poist, stáisiúin gardaí, siopaí, oifigí poist agus, fiú, tithe tábhairne.  Tá an-chuid fulaingthe ag na ceantair sin.  Anois, tá an Rialtas ag bualadh an bhuille seo orthu.  Tá na scoileanna ar an áis dheireannach chun beocht a choimeád sna pobail seo.  In ainneoin sin, beidh bagairt uafásach orthu.Tá ról eile ag na scoileanna Gaeltachta, ról eisceacht nach féidir cur ina ionad.  Tá na scoileanna Gaeltachta ar cheann des na príomh úirlisí chun an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a cosaint beo, chun fuinneamh a spreagadh, agus chun an Gaeilge a seachadadh don chéad ghlúin eile.  De réir an staidéar chuimsitheach theangeolaíoch ar úsáid na Gaeilge, beidh an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht marbh i gceann 20 bliain, muna dtugann an Rialtas tacaíocht agus cúnamh di.Aontaíonn móramh na ndaoine sa tír seo gur rud dlúth riachtanach í an Ghaeilge dár bhféiniúlacht.  Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na teanga.  Muna maireann an Ghaeilge mar theanga nádúrtha sa Ghaeltacht, ní mhairfidh saibhreas na Gaeilge sa tír uilig.  Is ionann ionsaí ar scoileanna Gaeltachta agus ionsaí ar an nGaeltacht féin.  Is ionann ionsaí ar scoileanna Gaeltachta agus ionsaí ar chultúr na tíre.An rud is úafásaí ná nach gcaithfidh an Rialtas dul síos an bóthar seo.  Tá sé ag iarraidh na scoileanna beaga ar fud na tíre a dhúnadh ag an am a bhfuil sé ag tabhairt na mbilliún euro dos na bannaí bainc.Níl bunús oideachasúil ag baint leis an mbeart seo.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil bunús eacnamaíoch gearthéarmach ag baint leis, ach ná déantar dearmad go mbeidh costas ann freisin.  Caithfidh an Rialtas dhá scoil a chur le chéile, seomraí ranga breise a thógáil, áiseanna nua a chruthú agus córais taistil a chur ar fáil.  Cruthóidh an polasaí seo coimhlint idir na pobail a bhéas ag cailliúint na scoileanna, an Stát, agus na pobail a bhéas ag coinneáil scoileanna agus a bhéas ag fáil achmhainní nua.Tá slí eile chun airgead a shábháil.  Ar smaoinigh an Rialtas ar pholasaí chomhshnaidhme a chur i bhfeidhm?  B'fhéidir gur cheart go bhfanfadh dhá scoil san dá shuíomh ina bhfuil siad agus go gceapfaí príomhoide, bord bainistíochta, rúnaí agus foireann múinteoireachta amháin ar an dá scoil.Ní mór an córas oideachais a thógáil thart timpeall na leanaí in ionad na leanaí a thógaint as a gceantair féin gach maidin.  Ní mór dúinn an Ghaeltacht a treisiú in ionad í a lagú.

The provision of rest and service areas is a statutory matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.The NRA currently provides two types of facilities — rest areas and service areas. The rest areas are the short sections of roadway provided off a motorway/dual carriageway where drivers can safely pull in to rest, change drivers, make a phone call or carry out other activities which would not be safe to do while driving. While Rest Areas do not provide any facilities other than the opportunity to park safely, they are numerous and dotted all along the motorway/dual carriageway network.Service Areas provide facilities such as restaurants, toilets, showers, parking and refuelling facilities. There are currently three on line service areas operational at Lusk and Castlebellingham on the M1 and at Enfield on the M4. The NRA has initiated a PPP tender process in relation to a second tranche of on line service areas — these service areas are planned for M6 motorway east of Athlone, the M9 motorway south of Kilcullen, and the operation of a third service area on the proposed M11 motorway north of Gorey.As the standards applicable to rest and service areas are a matter for the NRA, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if a reply is not received within ten working days.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	408	While the NRA, in association with the relevant road authorities, is responsible for the national road network, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.In the case of the national network the Exchequer provides all the funding while works on regional and local roads are to be funded by the relevant local authority from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. Since 1997, over €6.8 billion has been provided by the Exchequer to local authorities for works on regional and local roads. These funds were in addition to local authorities' own contributions.State funding to assist local authorities to maintain regional and local roads is apportioned as equitably as possible on the basis of factors such as route lengths and population densities. The initial selection of works as between regional and local roads within its area of responsibility is for the most part a matter for the relevant local authority, and I believe it would be a retrograde decision to take this role away from them.  The members of each local authority are ‘on the ground', and have a far better appreciation of the priorities in their own local area than officials in my Department.In the current financial circumstances my priority is to protect previous investment in the roads network and ensure that the distribution of available funding is done in the most targeted manner possible. In this context my Department is supporting the use by local authorities of pavement management systems to identify priorities for future road works on the regional and local road network.In relation to any proposal to increase funding to local roads, the total amount of capital and current funding for National, Regional and Local Roads is €885m this year. It will decrease to €533m next year and to €492m by 2016. In this context, if increase funding were to be made available for local roads it would be a question of cutting funding for other roads to a far greater extent. I have no proposals to do this.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 103 together.Myself and Minister Varadkar have been invited to attend the Olympic Games in London and I look forward to supporting our athletes and promoting Ireland as a destination to visit. We will attend some events on different, non-overlapping days and only one Minister from the Department will be present at any stage.Tourism Ireland, which has responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination, has been rolling out a busy programme of activity to target a wide range of potential visitors around the world in the run-up to and during the 2012 Games. This includes working with the official Olympics tour operators in a number of markets to offer package extensions for their clients attending the Games. A series of itineraries for the thousands of accredited and non-accredited media has also been developed, encouraging them to come here either before, during or after the Games.Furthermore the Games provide a significant opportunity in terms of targeting Londoners who may wish to escape the congestion and disruption in the city. With this in mind, Tourism Ireland has launched a significant advertising push targeting Londoners by presenting Ireland as the ideal destination to escape to for the duration of the Olympics. Social media including Facebook and Twitter is also being used to create an awareness of the key sporting events and festivals taking place across Ireland this Summer.Of course, on the sporting side many countries used Irish facilities to train in the lead up to the Games themselves. In particular, several countries availed of facilities at the National Aquatic Centre while other events prior to the Games themselves in sports such as hockey, sailing and athletics attracted competitors from overseas to Ireland.

The issue raised by the Deputy, in relation to the repair of the jetty on Dalkey Island, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. As mentioned in my response to Parliamentary Question 88 earlier, if a local authority identifies a project which has the potential to increase visitor numbers and which they believe would be eligible for tourism capital funding, they should engage directly with Fáilte Ireland, who have responsibility for the operation of the Tourism Capital Investment Programme.  I understand that no application has been made by Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in relation to this facility.  The Deputy should engage with the local authority directly on this matter in the first instance.

These changes will bring a more integrated, streamlined and focussed discipline to the delivery of both enterprise support and tourism services in the region.The Steering Group is being assisted by two Task Forces, the membership of which was announced last month. The Aviation Business Development Task Force will seek out and evaluate aviation-linked business opportunities that could be associated with the new merged entity while the Change Management Task Force will develop proposals for transitional arrangements and for the appropriate corporate, managerial and operational structures of the new entity, including matters related to IT, HR, Finance and property. This latter Task Force will also draw up proposals for the transfer of Shannon Development functions to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Fáilte Ireland.In addition, arrangements are being put in place for consultation with other stakeholders, such as IBEC and ICTU with whom preliminary consultations have already taken place.These groups are now up and running and I understand that they have already mapped out a busy schedule of work over the coming months to examine the range of issues that must be assessed in some detail in order to arrive at the best way forward for the new entity at Shannon. This will of course include examination of potential measures to maintain and improve access through the airport itself.The two task forces have been asked to submit their proposals to the Steering Group in November this year and when those have been evaluated by the Group, both myself and Minister Bruton will revert to Government before the end of the year with detailed proposals including an implementation strategy for the merger.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 736 together.This question relates to hosting international sports events in Ireland.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. As well as bringing spectators to our shores, the hosting of sports events such as the Ryder Cup, the Tall Ships Race, Volvo Ocean Race or the Solheim Cup can provide a great showcase for Ireland. Fáilte Ireland continues to support the holding of sports and other events that can boost tourism.The normal procedure in regard to the hosting of an international sporting event is that the Irish affiliate of the relevant governing body will bid to host the event in Ireland. In the case of rugby or soccer tournaments, any bid would be made by the IRFU or the FAI. I have expressed my support to both organisations for any bid that they decide to make.Where appropriate, the State Tourism agencies will provide advice and assistance to the sporting body which is seeking to secure an international event.  In certain cases it may also be appropriate for Fáilte Ireland to provide financial support towards the event, in return for a contractually-agreed package of tourism and publicity benefits.I am supportive of the efforts of the State Tourism Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract suitable international events, subject, of course, to overall Government financial constraints and an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any particular project.

However, the Programme for Government includes a commitment that in planning legislation the Government will promote and support universal design whereby all environments can be used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of age, ability or disability. I believe that all new publicly funded sports developments and the redevelopment of existing facilities should be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.  I can inform the Deputy that I launched a special initiative in 2011 to provide grants to local authorities for enhanced disabled access and energy efficiency measures in swimming pools. More than €14m has been allocated to local authorities by my Department under this initiative.

There will be extensive trade and public consultation as part of this process. Work will then begin on the detailed planning of the various sections of the route. Interpretation and infrastructure plans, like the pilot plan recently launched for Connemara, will be prepared for each section along the Wild Atlantic Way.

The core objective of the Strategy was to reduce the number of road fatalities to no greater than 60 fatalities per million population by the end of 2012, an average of 21 fatalities per month or 252 fatalities per annum. This was achieved in 2009,  with 238 deaths recorded. The number dropped to 212 in 2010 and to a record low of 186 in 2011, an average of 16 road fatalities per month. In the first five months of 2012 the monthly average reduced further, to 14. To put that in context, when the Strategy was being developed in 2006, the monthly average was over 30.Sadly, the month of June has gone very much against recent trends, with 25 lives lost the first time that the monthly target has been exceeded since October 2010. When you look at the monthly records over time, you will find occasional sharp fluctuations, followed by a return to the normal trend, but we do need to look closely at the details of these accidents to see if there is any pattern to the increase and the RSA and the Gardai are doing so.The RSA is currently in the process of developing the next Road Safety Strategy which will include measures to ensure that Ireland continues to build positively on road safety performance for the remainder of the decade and beyond. This Strategy will seek to drive new and ongoing measures to ensure that road safety standards do not slip.  The RSA is working closely with my Department in preparing the next strategy, which will cover the period 2013 to 2020. Discussions with key stakeholders are taking place and a public consultation process has begun. I urge anybody who feels they have a contribution to make in this area to contact the RSA and provide an input.  When the consultation processes have been completed, I expect to receive a submission from the RSA with draft proposals later this year.I am satisfied that funding to the RSA and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the bodies under my remit, is sufficient to maintain the continued implementation of the Road Safety Strategy.

However, other options are available now with a wide range of connectivity options available through other hubs in Europe and the US and through new hubs in the Gulf Region which now have direct services to/from Ireland.It is important to state that the State does not own nor has it control over landing or take-off slots at Heathrow Airport. Access by airlines to landing and take-off slots at EU airports where there are capacity limitations, including Heathrow, is governed by EU Regulations. Aer Lingus has access to quite a large number of slots at London Heathrow on the basis of ‘grandfather rights', that is, it has acquired the rights to these slots because it has been operating services to Heathrow for a long number of years and before Heathrow became as congested as it is today. More recently, Aer Lingus has also acquired additional slots. However, Aer Lingus and any other airline, cannot hold slots in perpetuity unless they comply with the requirements of the EU Regulations governing the allocation of slots.Aer Lingus can use the slots it currently has access to at Heathrow for whatever services it wishes;  the Government's minority shareholding does not allow it to dictate what services the slots are to be used for. Neither is the minority shareholding sufficient on its own to prevent Aer Lingus from disposing of Heathrow slots should it choose to do so.

It will create a Luas network by joining the Luas Red and Green Lines and will also link with rail services from Maynooth and Dunboyne and with existing Quality Bus schemes which enter or cross Dublin City Centre. It will also in time interchange with future key projects such as Dart Underground and Metro North.The project has been prioritised under the Governments's 5-year capital plan —Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 — Medium Term Exchequer Framework — which was published in November 2011. Funding has been included in my Department's capital allocation to 2016 to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and for pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  Construction is expected to take 4 years.

Every community in Ireland is invited to get involved.  Ultimately the Gathering's success will hinge on the participation of the public and in particular the mobilisation of local communities to create their own events and utilise their own overseas connections.Gathering Community Meetings to mobilise these communities are currently underway and will be held throughout Ireland in the months ahead.  Local Gathering organisations are being set up in every county, comprising sporting bodies, cultural organisations, local authorities, local development companies and representative bodies.All are welcome to attend the community meetings which offer an opportunity for local people to learn more about ‘The Gathering' and how they can be involved. Anyone with ideas for a ‘Gathering' can pledge them on the night or after the meeting. They can also access tools and supports online to help them to organise their Gatherings. Meetings have already been held in Roscommon, Castlebar and Ennis and another is scheduled for tomorrow in Tralee.  Details of other upcoming community meetings are available online at www.thegatheringireland.com. While direct financial supports are not envisaged,the website also provides online supports and ideas for those interested in setting up their own event as well as some examples of local Gathering events underway. Community projects already underway throughout Ireland include clan gatherings; twin town trips; school and work reunions; genealogical projects; family reunions and outreach initiatives where local communities will contact people who have left the county and invite them back for a special celebration.Support for the Gathering is also gaining momentum with a number of well-known Irish personalities pledging their support, including Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Maeve Binchy and Paul O'Connell. A large number of companies and organisations have already got involved, including Google and Facebook, while KPMG and PwC have confirmed they will hold their international alumni events in Ireland. I expect many more events to be put in place in the run-up to 2013.

I did this as a guest of some of the descendants of participants in the Rising.  The 1916 Rising was an important event in our history and is of great interest both domestically and internationally. In this context, I asked Fáilte Ireland to carry out an assessment of the potential interest from domestic and international visitors in the 1916 Rising and the possibility of developing a walking trail focused around the sites connected with the week of the Rising. I understand that key officials in Fáilte Ireland have since visited the sites and I expect the assessment will be completed in the coming months.

The best way to increase visitors to all regions is to increase overall visitors to the country as a whole. That is why the Government is providing over €143 million to support tourism in 2012 across a range of activities including overseas and domestic marketing, investment in tourism product and vital business supports to develop tourism across Ireland, in both rural and urban areas.Furthermore in recognition of the vital contribution of tourism to employment, economic activity and foreign revenue earnings, in tandem with the Visa Waiver scheme and the cut in employer's PRSI, the VAT rate on a range of labour-intensive tourism services was reduced from 13.5% to 9% enhancing the competitiveness of our tourism product.In addition, The Gathering Ireland 2013 will be held next year to attract a targeted 325,000 overseas visitors to all parts of Ireland. Communities in all regions will have an important role to play.  Ultimately the Gathering's success will hinge on the participation of the public and in particular the mobilisation of local communities to create their own events and utilise their own overseas connections.

Following from a decision of this Government in May of 2011, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) was given responsibility for this project. At the same time, the Government decided in the interests of efficiency and best use of resources that the system for issuing driver licences, currently diffused through the local authorities, should be centralised in the RSA. Legislation to make the RSA the national driver licensing authority was recently passed by the Oireachtas.My Department has been working closely with the RSA and other key stakeholders to ensure both the timely delivery of the new format of licence and a smooth transition to the new centralised driver licensing system. A group consisting of representatives of my Department, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the City and County Managers Association, as well as the RSA, has been monitoring and facilitating progress to ensure that both the plastic licence and centralised driver licensing systems proceed as planned.

As such, there is a regular and ongoing day-to-day operational interaction with commercial and other entities in the aviation sector, domestically and internationally. When the IAA was being established almost twenty years ago it was considered that the delivery of its services to its airspace customers would be enhanced and more efficient and effective if it were operating in a commercially orientated environment where operational decisions could be made quickly and responsively.The IAA does not receive State funding and generates sufficient revenue to cover all of its payroll and other costs through charges and fees raised from its airline customers and regulatory clients. The IAA's air navigation charges are amongst the lowest of States in Eurocontrol and I am satisfied that the IAA is operating its commercial remit in a satisfactory fashion. Furthermore, certain of the IAA's charges are either subject to national regulations or set within an EU regulatory framework. The CEO's salary has been capped in accordance with the Government decision on pay ceilings for CEOs of Semi State and senior public sector posts.

I have ensured that it will be included in the updated Core Ten-T Network currently under discussion and have also proposed that it be designated part of a specific Core Corridor under the Regulation governing the next round of Ten-T funding for the period 2014-2020.To date, €10m has been allocated from the Ten-T Budget to cover the design and development process, geotechnical investigations and various technical surveys and studies.  Most of the work for which funding was allocated has already been completed and €5.5m has been claimed to date with the balance likely to be claimed in 2012.Any further claims for funding for DART Underground from the TEN-T budget in the future would firstly be dependent on a decision to proceed with the project and to provide Exchequer funding for construction in the 2014-2020 period.  This decision will be considered when the next capital programme is being prepared.Notwithstanding the uncertainty around the overall project at this time there may be some limited scope within available resources to continue to fund some associated works such as re-signalling which have capacity and other benefits for the Core Corridor as standalone projects. I will, therefore, keep this under review in the context of TEN-T funding as a case can be made that these associated projects should qualify for TEN-T funding in advance of the overall project proceeding.Based on the outline Business Case, dated April 2010, the estimated overall cost of DART Underground would be in the region of €4.1billion with the tunnel element which was proposed as a PPP accounting for €2.6billion and associated electrification, resignalling and rolling stock costing around €1.5 billion. However, these figures are not likely to be relevant in 2016 and will need to be updated as part of the overall project review in advance of the next capital programme.

Under the Takeover Rules, Ryanair must issue its formal offer document to Aer Lingus shareholders by 17th July setting out in detail the terms of its offer. As the Government is a minority shareholder in Aer Lingus, under Irish Takeover Panel Rules, there are restrictions on what any member of the Government can say in relation to the proposed offer at this time. For the moment, like all shareholders, the Government will await the formal offer from Ryanair and also the response of the Board of Aer Lingus.In considering the formal offer, when it is made, the Government will take account of four factors:1. The views of the regulatory authorities in relation to any bid;2. What is best for passengers in terms of connectivity and air fares;3. What is best for taxpayers in terms of the price we can get for the stake;4. What is best for the economy overall in terms of competitive access to services in and out of Ireland.

It places particular emphasis on tourism as one of the key sectoral areas for the generation of employment. It also recognises the role that infrastructure investment — including in the transport area - plays in underpinning employment growth.  My focus as Minister is on successfully implementing the actions for which I have responsibility under the overall Government plan rather than on the development of a separate stand-alone job creation plan for my Department.

While schemes in  other cities are technically feasible, their commercial viability would require a collaborative approach with the private sector. Funding provision to meet the capital investment costs of the roll-out of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the 5-year capital funding allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures. However, operational funding is not available from within the constrained current funding allocation.   My Department is currently exploring options to meet operating costs of schemes including a sponsorship deal which could prove to be very attractive for a private sector organisation. There is also potential for funding that could be unlocked by City Councils through the provision of additional advertising space within their cities.  However, the potential and extent of funding from advertising will require further examination.Optimal procurement approaches will be determined in the context of the best mechanisms to bridge the operational funding gap.

In particular, the matter was brought to my attention when I visited Canada (Quebec and Ontario) over the St. Patrick's Day period and met with some of the newly arrived young emigrants at the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto.Driving licences in Canada are issued on a provincial rather than federal basis.  Therefore, in response to requests from a number of people seeking to exchange their Irish driving licences for a Canadian licence, our Ambassador in Canada contacted all the main provincial authorities to establish details of their driving testing schemes and their willingness to enter into a reciprocal driving licence exchange scheme.  To date a number of provinces including Quebec and Ontario have indicated their interest in entering into an agreement with Ireland and my Department has brought this information to the attention of the RSA.I have also brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and assured him that my Department and the Embassy in Ottawa will continue to work with him to deliver a positive outcome.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	447	Each application for a passport, which is received by the Passport Service, is processed in accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act 2008 (the Act). Details of the various requirements are outlined in the Passport Application Form Notes which accompany each application form. These are also available on the Department's website www.passport.ie
As regards the person in question, I can confirm that an application for a passport was received by the Passport Service on 16 April, 2012.  It did not, however, fully meet with the requirements of the Act and thus could not be finalised for passport issue. Accordingly, the Passport Service wrote to the applicant's mother on 25 April, 2012 to inform her of this decision and to advise her of the requirements, which are needed to progress the application.  No reply has been received to date from her.It should be noted that new application form, which has been sent to her, has been pre-registered on the passport system so that on its receipt by the Passport Service, it will be automatically linked into the information and content of the first application.In light of this, I would recommend that the applicant's mother should reply to the Passport Service's letter of 25 April, 2012 and complete the forms that have been given to her.  To help her with this, she can refer to the sources of information in respect of the completion of application forms which is mentioned above or she may contact the Deputy Passport Officer in Balbriggan, Mr. Brian Mulligan (tel. 01.673.3247 — email brian.mulligan@dfa.ie) who is familiar with the application details.

In some cases, this involves the provision of funding to associations, organisations or other bodies.In addition to these organisations, further funding, generally in relatively small amounts, is made available through our Mission network for local programmes and projects.  In the time available it has not been possible to collate a list of these beneficiaries.In all cases the number of organisations and the amount of support is kept under review and opportunities for savings are actively explored.  It should be noted that in the case of many of the larger payments made by my Department the sum involved is an assessed mandatory contribution representing Ireland's share of the running costs of organisations such the UN and its agencies and other international bodies.Under Vote 27 — International Cooperation — my Department manages the Government's official programme of development assistance, Irish Aid.  This involves the provision of funding and support for a wide of range of organisations engaged in development cooperation.Organisations funded include UN Agencies, Programme Country Governments, large Irish and International development Non-Governmental Organisations, Missionary Organisations, other International and Multilateral Organisations, and smaller civil society based organisations, all of which are focused on the fight against global poverty and hunger.Funding is provided to partner organisations following a rigorous appraisal process by Irish Aid. All funding applications must meet strict and transparent criteria, have clearly identified specific objectives and have demonstrable results that will have a sustainable and positive impact on improving the lives of some of the world's poorest communities.Based on the trend over the past three years, on average, Irish Aid funds in excess of four hundred organisations annually. Approximately one third of Irish Aid funding is channelled through Non Governmental and Missionary Organisations, a third through UN Agencies and other Multilateral Organisations, while the remainder is channelled through other International Development Organisations and Programme Country Government systems. A detailed analysis of spending under the aid programme is provided each year in the Irish Aid Annual Report.In addition to the individual reviews that form a normal part of my Department's approach to funding, an overall review of funding was carried out last year as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, which resulted in some savings being achieved. Information regarding remuneration and salaries for 2009 and 2010 can be obtained Department's appropriation accounts prepared by my Department on an annual basis which are published on the website of the Comptroller and Auditor General http://www.audgen.gov.ie. Pensions payable to former staff of my Department are administered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The three main components of the Department's system of foreign services allowances are as follows.Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is designed to defray costs associated with living in cities where the cost of living is higher than in Dublin, based on data provided by an independent external consultancy.  Because the COLA is linked to salary and notional net take-home pay it has been reduced in line with salary reductions in the civil service and with increases in taxation in recent years.Local Post Allowance (LPA) provides assistance towards the additional indirect costs arising from the representational role of officers.  This allowance, which varies according to marital status and grade, is payable at all locations abroad.  Officers serving in designated "hardship" posts may also be entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.Children's Foreign Allowance (CFA) compensates officers for additional costs incurred with regard to their children aged under 18, or under 21 and in full time education.AllowanceNumber of recipients (excluding staff seconded from other Departments)Estimated total cost per annumTaxable Y/NCost of Living Allowance325 approx at any one time€2,394,000NLocal Post Allowanceas above€5,557,000NChild Foreign AllowanceApprox 128 officers in respect of 224 children (January 2012)€709,000NForeign Service Allowance OtherApprox 16 officers at any one time€156,000NIn addition, the following additional allowances may be paid to officers in particular circumstances, usually in the form of refunds for vouched expenditure or paid directly on behalf of officers:AllowanceNumber of recipients (excluding staff seconded from other Departments)Estimated total cost per annumTaxable Y/NRent Allowance265 approx at any one time (excludes staff in directly provided accommodation)€7,937,000NFurniture AllowanceApprox 50 in 2011€97,773NSchool Fees AssistanceApprox 46 officers in respect of 76 children (January 2012)€1,062,000NRepresentational AllowancePayable at all Missions in relation to vouched expenditure on official representational activities — allocated to individual officers at discretion of Head of Mission€2,033,000N/AHealth Insurance top-upApprox 318 officers and 335 dependents (January 2012)€811,000NOther MedicalApprox 50 cases in total in 2011€65,000NDetention Allowance (payable for a limited period to officers while seeking accommodation on taking up duty abroad)Approx 60 officers and families where relevant (2011)€140,109NDisturbance Allowance (to assist officers with the necessary costs associated with return from posting)Approx 57 officers and families where relevant (2011)€280,237NTemporary Accommodation costs (payable while officers seek permanent accommodation at posting location abroad)Approx 60 cases (2011)€284,030N

Under Irish law they are the legal guardians of their child.  Accordingly, their witnessed consent, albeit provided from different locations, must be provided.The list of acceptable witnesses for the signing of this consent is quite extensive and is not limited to police officers. It includes a member of the clergy, medical doctor, lawyer, bank manager, elected public representative, notary public/commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner, school principal/vice principal or accountant who is personally known to the signatory or is identified to witness by someone known to them.  The father of the child in question may, therefore, may wish to use one of these witnesses for his consent.

The principal focus across a very wide range of policy areas and Council formations will be on stimulating sustainable economic growth and job creation across Europe.On 1 June a draft calendar of meetings to be held in Brussels during the Presidency was circulated to partners.  In parallel planning is proceeding in consultation with Government Departments on the meetings that will be held in Ireland during the period. Regular contact with Cyprus and our Trio partners, Lithuania and Greece, has been maintained at ministerial and senior official. The Taoiseach and I have both informally discussed Presidency planning with our Cypriot colleagues. Most recently, Minister of State Creighton met her Cypriot counterpart, Deputy Minister Mavroyannis, in Horsens in Denmark on 13 June and the new Lithuanian Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in Brussels at the end of May. Since coming into office, I have travelled to Athens and Vilnius while the Minister of State has travelled to Vilnius and Nicosia where we have had the opportunity to discuss Presidency preparations. We are looking forward to engaging with our counterparts in the Greek administrations. The meetings are important for ensuring clarity on the issues we want to prioritise and continuity of business between Presidencies.At official level, discussions have been held in Brussels and in capitals between the Trio partners to discuss our 18-month joint programme. A further meeting at the level of Permanent Representatives will be held in Brussels in July before each partner submits to the Council Secretariat the issues they propose to prioritise during their Presidency. The Council Secretariat has responsibility for drafting the Trio programme which will be circulated to Member States in the autumn for their consideration.The Trio programme will be framed within the context of the overall EU agenda and will also reflect the progress made by the Cypriot Presidency.  However, there are a number of clear overarching priorities that will form the backdrop to our contribution to the Trio programme as well as to the development of our national Presidency programme.We will seek to prioritise those proposals which are clearly related to the jobs and growth agenda across all policy areas. The Irish Presidency will also work to finalise agreement on those aspects of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) process that remain outstanding at the start of 2013.  The MFF will set out the EU budget for the period 2014-2020 and has linkages to many policy issues of direct national importance to Ireland including the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation).  The Presidency will make every effort to contribute to the restoration of macroeconomic stability across the EU through the implementation of the Union's new economic governance procedures.  In this context, Ireland will have the responsibility for managing in Council the European Semester, the process through which Member States coordinate their economic and budgetary policies. Work will continue at all levels of Government over the coming months to refine and develop the programme, in close cooperation with partner states, the European institutions and civil society.Ireland has held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on six previous occasions and we earned the reputation for being impartial and efficient managers of the EU agenda. It is a reputation we will seek to uphold next year.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 204 together.The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In Ireland the zero rate applies to printed books, including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music.  It is possible for Ireland to apply the zero rate to printed books because Ireland applied the zero rate to these books on and before 1 January 1991, and the EU VAT Directive provides a derogation for such exceptional VAT treatment to continue to apply.  However, the VAT Directive does not allow goods and services to apply at the zero rate which were not in place at that rate on 1 January 1991.  As e-books were not applied at the zero rate in 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to them now.Furthermore, under the EU VAT Directive, all digitised publications, regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate), are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT, which in Ireland is 23%. E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate. There is no option under EU VAT law to exempt e-books from VAT or to apply a reduced rate to them.  While it is possible to reduce the standard VAT rate on e-books to below 23%, such a reduction would have to apply to all goods and services at the standard VAT rate, which accounts for the majority of activity liable to VAT, and would be excessively costly to the Exchequer.

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a tax on the commission charged.  The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. This Bill is well advanced and it is hoped that it will be published this session.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As I stated in my reply to PQ 163 of 28 February 2012, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.The Credit Review Office (CRO) reviews decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from €1,000 up to €500,000. The Credit Review Office is overturning 60% of the decisions referred to them, supplying €6.9m of credit, supporting 683 jobs in the SME sector. I would appeal to SMEs who have been refused credit by banks to avail of the services of the CRO.In terms of the pillar banks' progress in achieving the 2012 targets, the information reported to my Department and the CRO is commercially sensitive. As such there is limited specific detail that can be divulged on the tracking of the banks' performances. However, Head of the CRO John Trethowan notes in his eighth quarterly report that combined loan sanction levels in quarter one are broadly similar to the figures for quarter one last year. Lending transactions recorded by the two banks in quarter one are 15% lower than quarter one last year. He goes on to state that these numbers are a function of a number of variables:(i) A softness in demand for lending reported by the banks, and observed by both the Mazars survey and recent Central Bank reporting;(ii) Borrowers paying down debt rather than seeking new loans;(iii) The tighter credit conditions in banks.The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill was published on 22 June and my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is taking the legislation through the Oireachtas at present. The scheme, which is expected to be operational from early Autumn, will facilitate up to €40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to €150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for SME's who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	460	As previously advised to the Deputy, there is no single standard set of terms for stapled debt which NAMA may offer to parties acquiring commercial property from NAMA borrowers or receivers.  Terms quoted will vary to reflect the attributes of various commercial property categories and individual properties, the varying strengths of tenants and leases, and the strength of counterparties/property purchasers.  NAMA advises that only strong and reputable counterparties will be considered for stapled finance.  For instance, NAMA advises that for prime investment properties, that is properties whose investment characteristics include, for instance, good location and strong tenants on leases with long maturity at realistic rents, which would qualify for the most generous loan terms, NAMA may offer up to 70% of the purchase price for a period of 5 years at a typical interest margin of 3% over cost of funds.   NAMA further advises the first sale of property using staple finance provided by the Agency was that of No 1 Warrington Place in Dublin; that there are a number of further such sales in the pipeline; and that NAMA envisages that it will make up to €2 billion in staple finance available to purchasers of commercial properties controlled by its debtors and receivers in markets in which those debtors and receivers hold commercial properties. The Agency advises that the further detail sought by the Deputy is commercially sensitive and that disclosure of the information would impede NAMA's ability to negotiate the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer in each disposal undertaken by its debtors and receivers.

The May 2011 Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika included a target for the disposal of assets by NAMA by the end of 2013.   The NAMA Board had set a target of repaying €7.5bn of the NAMA Senior Bonds in issue by the end of 2013. In the most recent meetings with the Troika it was agreed that the Memorandum of Understanding be amended to align to this more appropriate, but closely related, target.The debt repayment target is considered to be a more appropriate measure to monitor than asset disposals, which can be impacted by currency and other external factors. The Troika seek progress reports on the target at the quarterly meetings with NAMA.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of income earners earning more than €100,000 per year, estimated by reference to the income tax year 2012, is 113,500.  As the Deputy is aware, the top rate of income tax is 41 per cent, which applies to single individuals earning in excess of €32,800, married one-earner couples earning in excess of €41,800 and married two-earning couples earning in excess of €65,600 (the tax band of €65,600 to married couples with two incomes in 2012 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of €41,800). Other streams of income are taxed at different rates, such as deposit interest income, which is liable to a 30 per cent rate of tax. Therefore, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a third rate of income tax of 50 per cent to be applied on the portion of incomes in excess of €100,000 per annum.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the introduction of a new 50% rate would be of the order of €490 million. This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2009, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. It is, therefore, provisional and subject to revision. For the purposes of this estimate it is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax rate would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  However, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.It should also be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

I am further advised by NAMA that the property is located on a flood plain and in the middle of an industrial estate.  As a result of its condition and location, NAMA advises that the investment required to bring the property to a habitable state and to the point that it could be sold, in the unlikely event that a willing buyer exists, would be such as to make the investment uneconomical and that it is questionable whether structurally such works could in fact be undertaken. In any event, NAMA advises that Longford County Council, in detailing the Category 4 remediation works to be taken as part of the agreed site resolution plan in respect of this development, set out a requirement that the apartment block be demolished.NAMA has advised me that to undertake the necessary remediation on this development, including the proposed demolition of this block, it had first to take enforcement proceedings over the property, which was a protracted process involving the reinstatement of an Isle of Man holding company.  NAMA further advises that it has expended no monies to date on the apartment block other than monies incurred in the general remediation and upkeep of the overall development in which it is located; and that it has made a provision of €150,000 for all demolition and remediation works relating to the block.NAMA advises that decisions relating to the provision of social housing are a matter for the relevant housing authorities; that it has identified over 3,000 residential units as being available and potentially suitable for social housing and that the onus is now on housing authorities to determine the suitability of these units for the provision of social housing within their functional areas.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	469	In agreeing to requests for rent abatements from its debtors, NAMA must in all instances be cognisant of the overriding requirement to preserve the value of collateral supporting its loans.  The Agency seeks to ensure this by implementing rent abatements under the terms set out in its Guidance Note on Upwards Only Commercial Leases, which is available on its website, www.nama.ie.  The terms of the Guidance Note are intended to deal with situations where tenants of NAMA debtors can demonstrate that the rents payable under their current leases are in excess of current market levels and that, in consequence, the viability of their business is threatened.  This situation clearly does not arise in the case of businesses that are profitably trading or part of a profitably trading group that are in a position to honour their current contractual arrangements on rent, nor was it ever intended that the Guidance Note on Upwards Only Commercial Leases would confer benefit on such businesses. NAMA advises that the judicious implementation of rent abatements can support the achievement of its objective of preserving the value of its properties securing its loans by (1) ensuring that qualifying tenants remain in business and continue to thereby generate rental income and (2) by safeguarding jobs and economic activity in general.  The Agency points out that as rent abatements are typically agreed for an initial fixed period of no more than twelve months and are thereafter subject to ongoing assessment by reference to factors such as turnover and business profitability, any short-term loss of rental income arising from abatements is likely to be more than off-set by these long-term benefits.  Agreement to rent abatements outside of the terms of the Guidance Note would, in contrast, prove contrary to the requirement on the Agency to protect the position of Irish taxpayers by extracting the best possible returns on its acquired loans and underlying property assets.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	470	It is important to point out that NAMA has placed no such requirement on any tenant nor has it requested a rent increase in any case.  I presume the Deputy is referring to specific commercial lease terms entered into freely by a tenant and landlord and which are better addressed between the parties.  As previously advised to the Deputy, NAMA has acquired loans from the five participating institutions and is not the owner/operator of the underlying properties. The Agency's role is that of a secured lender. Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers/agents.  The owners/professional managers are responsible for the efficient running of properties, the collection of rents and service charges, arrangements for letting of vacant units and the operation of rent reviews in accordance with the leases into which tenants have entered.  On the issue of rent abatements, as I also outlined in my reply to this matter previously, NAMA has published very clear Guidelines, available on www.nama.ie, for tenants seeking a rent reduction from a NAMA debtor or receiver. It is important to emphasise that applications for rent abatements may be made in situations where tenants of NAMA debtors can demonstrate that the rents payable under their current leases are in excess of current market levels and, as a result, that the viability of their businesses is threatened. In such circumstances, tenants may seek NAMA’s approval for rent reductions. By the end of May 2012, the Agency had approved 145 applications for rent reductions under these Guidelines with just 4 applications refused.  I am happy that this system is working well and NAMA is playing a leading role.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 200, 201, 209 and 210 together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding tax system that operates in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including "any board or body established by or under statute  and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas". As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.I am also informed that Finance Act 2011 did not introduce any change in terms of the obligations of Boards of Management to operate RCT.   Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management are, and always were, required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax. The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system.  This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT.I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT system.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT system and has also met with representatives of some Boards of Management.  In addition, local Revenue offices have been contacting Boards of Management who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT responsibilities.  Detailed guidance notes regarding the operation of RCT by school Boards of Management are being prepared and will soon be made available on the Revenue website and also made available to the Department of Education and Skills.Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT system is implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they continue to work with all qualifying lenders to ensure that the necessary software changes to lenders' Tax Relief at Source (TRS) systems are in place at the earliest possible date.  The speed with which the required software changes can be developed and implemented varies from lender to lender. The vast majority of lenders have now successfully completed testing of their software programmes and have passed on the 30% rate. Where , in relation to any lender, there is reason for concern about the pace of implementation having regard to all of the circumstances, Revenue is in direct contact with the lender concerned to ensure the necessary changes are implemented as a matter of urgency.As an interim relieving measure a 25% rate available in the ICT systems was applied to all eligible accounts from January last. Once the necessary software changes are implemented each lender implements the 30% rate in full, and also credits any balance of relief due for earlier months.

However it should be noted that this clearing cycle may be shorter in some circumstances (in particular, where the accounts of the payer and the payee are both held with the same branch of the same bank). As to the related matter of when a bank will permit a customer to draw against a cheque lodged to his or her account, this is a matter for decision for each bank based on its own risk management arrangements and would be outlined in the relevant terms and conditions.  With regard to credit cards, a number of steps must be completed before a retailer's bank account is credited following acceptance of a payment by credit, debit or pre-paid card from a customer.Once the card has been inserted into the point of sale (POS) terminal at the counter and verified by PIN (or in some circumstances by signature), this device transmits the card data and transaction amount to the retailer's acquirer. The acquirer routes a request for payment to the bank that issued the card to the customer and — assuming that all is in order (e.g. that the cardholder has sufficient credit, that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen, etc.) — the card-issuing bank authorises the transaction and an authorisation code is sent back to the retailer via the acquirer.Later on (the exact timing and the frequency of this step will depend on the arrangements agreed between the retailer and the acquirer), the retailer will, in batch process capture and transmit the data relating to all authorised card transactions in a given period to the acquirer. The acquirer will process these transactions via the relevant card scheme (e.g. VISA, MasterCard) and collect the total amounts due to the retailer from all the card-issuing banks. The card issuing banks will then transfer these amounts via the card schemes to the acquirer who will, in turn, pay these on to the retailer's bank. That bank then credits the retailer's account to complete the process. Value is normally given to the retailer on a ‘next day' basis following completion of the batch transaction processing.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	480	One of the primary objectives of NAMA is the repayment of the cost of the loans acquired from the Participating Institutions and the cost of the working and development capital expenditure on the assets attached to the loans.  I am advised by NAMA that through its activities, including a phased and orderly asset disposal programme and investment in residential and commercial projects underlying its loans, it is well advanced in terms of meeting this overriding objective.  The recent repayment of €2 billion of its senior debt, which brings the total redeemed to date to some €3.25 billion, is further evidence of this and the Agency has advised that it is firmly on course to meet its first major milestone of repaying €7.5 billion of Senior Bonds by the end of 2013.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which I launched in January this year, was developed as a direct response to specific skills shortages in the ICT sector. The Plan outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates to support the further expansion and development of the ICT sector and support innovation and growth across other sectors of the economy.As part of the Plan, 750 places have been made available on new Higher Diploma Level 8 Conversion ICT Programmes which began rolling out in higher education institutions across the country from March 2012. Access is free of charge to participants who will obtain a level 8 higher diploma.  Graduates of these programmes will be available in early 2013. In addition, 530 people with a qualification at level 8 or Master's level in ICT are now due to graduate from the first phase of Springboard. A further 2,200 places on ICT programmes from certificate to masters degree level are now open for applications as part of Springboard 2012.In terms of medium term graduate supply, the indications are that the message is getting through to those applying for full time higher education that Technology courses (including Science, Computing and Engineering)offer good opportunities for graduates in today's job market.  This year's CAO applications data shows that first preference applications to Technology courses are showing an increase in total proportion of discipline choices from 17.7% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2012. In numerical terms, the number of students applying to study Technology courses increased from 11,370 in 2011 to 12,230 in 2012, a percentage increase of 7.5%. Other actions provided for in the Plan are also underway including the establishment of a new high level Academic Industry Foresight Group chaired by John Hennessy, Chair of HEA, and with strong high level industry membership.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form and supporting documentation, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student should qualify for a maintenance grant.Officials in my Department have been in contact with SUSI which has confirmed that an application was received from this student on 15 June 2012. Processing of this application has commenced and the student will be notified directly of the outcome in due course.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The only costs incurred by my Department in relation to providing services through the Irish language were in respect of the translation of documents and the provision of Irish language training to staff.It is a requirement of the Official Languages Act that documents setting out public policy proposals, annual reports, statements of strategy, and matters considered to be of major public importance, are communicated by Government Departments in both Irish and English.The table sets out the translation costs and the Irish language training costs incurred by my Department for the past five years. The translation expenditure includes the cost of translating documents from English to Irish and from Irish to English. The Deputy should note that these figures also include some translations into languages other than Irish or English. The cost element in respect of translations to languages other than Irish or English is not significant.Expenditure (€)YearTranslationIrish language TrainingTotal Cost2012 to date50,505.63050,505.632011145,004.1613,453.10158,457.262010138,251.0015,350.00153,601.002009152,196.793,135.00155,331.792008156,060.4023,630.00179,690.40
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	484	All recognised national schools running costs are met by my Departments schemes of capitation and ancillary service grants. Schools receive capitation funding in January and June, and the ancillary services grant in March.  The amount paid to an individual national school by way of capitation and ancillary services grants is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60 and a maximum grant in the case of schools of 500 or more.The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools. The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. Given the scale of our economic crisis, I have no scope to introduce new or additional funding measures to assist schools generally or for specific purposes, such as those referred to by the Deputy.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	485	There are currently 19 one teacher schools in the primary school system. Based on information available to my Department there will be 16 such schools in the coming school year 2012/13.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	486	My Department has recently published updated "Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools". These procedures are based on the recently published "Children First — National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011" and apply to all primary and post-primary schools, irrespective of size.The new procedures incorporate significant improvements to the previous school guidelines and are intended to better ensure consistent and uniform implementation of Children First across all schools. The improvements include a new template child protection policy, a requirement that all primary schools fully implement the Stay Safe programme and also put in place improved oversight arrangements at Board of Management level.Continuing Professional Development (CPD) on the recently published Child Protection Procedures has been offered to all Designated Liaison Persons or Deputy Designated Liaison Persons appointed since 2009.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provided a one day Child Protection seminar in local Education Centres with a total of 44 seminars arranged to date. My Department also provided funding for substitution cover for attendance at these seminars. In addition, a two-hour evening information workshop on the revised procedures was provided by PDST to all other Designated Liaison and Deputy Designated Liaison Persons in order to give an update on the key changes and requirements. A total of 35 information sessions have been arranged across the network of education centres.  Furthermore, the Child Abuse Prevention Programme continues to provide staff training and additional support and advice for schools and boards of management on the Stay Safe Programme, on the development of child protection policies and protocols and on liaising with relevant agencies in health and education.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the national statutory body with responsibility for ensuring that health and safety requirements are met by all employers, including schools.   The Authority also provides information and advice to organisations to assist them in ensuring that their responsibilities in respect of health and safety in the workplace are met.  The HSA has published a number of resources specifically for schools to support them in managing health and safety in the school environment. It also provides a number of online training courses specifically for the school sector. Further details on the advice, resources and training courses available from the HSA can be obtained by contacting the HSA at the local number 1890 289 389 or from the HSA's website www.hsa.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	488	As the Deputy may be aware, in June 2011, I announced the need for the establishment of 20 new primary schools to cater for increased demographics across a number of locations up to 2017, including the Sandymount/ Ringsend area in Dublin 2/4.I also announced new arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and post-primary schools. The new arrangements published by my Department provide a balanced approach to allow applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools. The criteria used in deciding patronage of the new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage. This consideration will have regard to the patronage of the existing schools in an area.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department has approved funding for the construction of a mainstream classroom as well as accommodation for pupils with special educational needs at the school to which he refers. A letter confirming this approval has issued to the school authority.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Scheme the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution. The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged (EU or Non EU rate) , in cases where undergraduate students do not qualify for free fees and in the case of postgraduate study, are a matter for the institutions to determine and accordingly I have no role in the matter.Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries. Details are available on the Revenue Commissioners' website at www.revenue.ie.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The three European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) programmes in support of almost 9,000 redundant workers made redundant in subsectors NACE 41 (Construction of Buildings), NACE 43 (Specialised Construction Activities) and NACE 71 (Architectural Services) of the construction industry between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010, ended on 9 June 2012. Various service providers are preparing the submission of their claims and as such, the Department does not yet have total expenditures for these programmes. Final reports on these programmes together with statements of certified final expenditure are required to be submitted to the European Commission by 9 December 2012. A full picture of reimbursements will only emerge after that time and no monies have been returned to the EU in the interim.In relation to the role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), this is generally to support manufacturing and internationally traded services in the micro enterprise sector where export earnings can be achieved and where State investment can achieve optimal returns. The criteria under which funding is available from the CEBs is based on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate, and the size or proposed size of the enterprise. CEBs can assist in the establishment, and/or development, of new and existing enterprises from individuals/sole traders, companies and community groups subject to certain eligibility criteria. In addition, CEBs provide a range of business advice, training and one-to-one mentoring supports.The CEBs had responsibility for the delivery of the enterprise support element of the EGF programmes for construction industry subsectors NACE 41, 43 and 71. Under these programmes, micro-enterprises could be supported in line with national policy, having due regard to any deadweight or displacement concerns. Under these particular EGF programmes, both financial and non-financial assistance, such as mentoring and training and development services, which was provided  to EGF eligible redundant workers seeking to develop and progress business start-ups, was required to support core CEB activities within normal CEB parameters. However, in this context there was no requirement made by the CEB that a business proposal must have been limited to the particular sector or activity in which the worker was employed prior to redundancy.

The NDFA is currently reviewing the project with a view to tendering for a Design Team in the near future.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 to 225, inclusive, together.On the approval of construction contracts where school authorities are the client, my Department advises the school authorities in detail of the new requirements that have been introduced by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the operation of Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) and which are required to be complied with.In the first instance an explanation of the background to the new requirements is provided. In this regard, RCT is a tax regime applicable to construction contracts in which tax is deducted by a principal contractor from payments due to a contractor for construction operations. RCT applies to main contractors in their dealings with sub-contractors. The Revenue Commissioners have now decided that with effect from the 1st January 2012 school Boards of Management are regarded as "Principal Contractor". This means that the Board of Management undertaking works funded by the Department will be responsible for complying with RCT requirements and VAT returns when making payments to their contractor.  The Revenue Commissioners have introduced a mandatory electronic RCT system for all principal contractors in the RCT system, so that all filings and notifications must be done online through the Revenue Online System (ROS).Full details of these new requirements are available on www.revenue.ie or from the local Revenue Office.  School authorities are further advised of the guidelines that should be followed to ensure compliance with Section 20 of the Finance Act 2011.1. Register online for the Revenue Online Service (ROS).2. Register with Revenue as a Principal Contractor and for Value Added Tax (VAT).3. Obtain the Contractor's tax reference number and proof of identity.4. Prior to commencement of construction, notify Revenue of the Contract (Contract Notification).5. Prior to discharging any payment to the Contractor, notify Revenue of the payment (Payment Notification).6. Obtain a Deduction Authorisation from Revenue specifying the tax to be deducted from the Contractor.7. Provide the Contractor a copy of the deduction Authorisation.8. Deduct the applicable amount of tax from payments due to the Contractor.9. File RCT returns and pay the deducted amount to Revenue.10. File monthly VAT returns and pay the VAT to Revenue.11. Obtain and keep a Deduction Summary — Periodic Return at the end of each return period.As the compliance outlined above involves school authorities with construction contracts interacting with the Revenue Commissioners on a regular basis, my Department considers that any issues or queries arising from the new procedures are directed by school authorities to the Revenue Commissioners.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools. It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  There has been no change to the mainstream staffing allocation of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2012/13 school year. The school has 19 classroom teachers in the current school year and will have the same number for  the coming school year 2012/13.The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2010/11 school year.The national average class size is 23.9 pupils. However, with over 20,600 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	495	It is not possible to provide the information requested in the time available.  A reply will issue to the Deputy as soon as the information is to hand.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department, determine eligibility by measuring the shortest traversable route from a child's home to the relevant education centre. Bus Éireann are currently processing applications for school transport for the 2012/13 school year. The number and size of vehicles required will be determined by the number of eligible pupils whose applications are finalised by the deadline date at the end of July.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport to a particular school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.Children who applied for enrolment in their nearest school but who did not secure a place may have their school transport eligibility considered by reference to the distance they reside from their next nearest school. This consideration will only apply where my Department is satisfied that the child's nearest school does not have the capacity to enrol additional first year pupils.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The sharp decline in apprentice recruitment and significant levels of redundancies in many apprenticeship trades over the past three years has resulted in a dramatic fall off in the number of apprentices requiring education and training in the institutes of technology and colleges of further education. The requirement for Carpentry and Joinery provision has been particularly affected, having fallen from a high of 168 blocks nationally in 2008 to an expected national requirement for 15 blocks in 2012.In light of the collapse in demand for this trade and following close consultations with the education providers and FÁS, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has allocated Carpentry and Joinery provision to a reduced number of colleges on a regional cluster basis for the 2012/13 academic year.  As part of this process some colleges, including the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown (ITB), will cease provision in this trade.In line with the commitment in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, a review of the apprenticeship training model is being undertaken during 2012.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 264 together.Surveying will be carried out in five pilot areas initially in October this year and surveys in the balance of the forty four areas will take place in November. The 44 initial areas where surveys of parental preferences will be carried out include the Dublin 6 and 8 districts.The outcome of the initial surveys will then be made available to the relevant school patrons who will be asked to come forward with divesting options in line with parental preferences within the areas. Full details of the Action Plan that I announced recently in response to the report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I wish to explain that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.SENOs are currently notifying schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.The NCSE has confirmed that the SNA allocation for the school in question for the 2012/13 school year is a sufficient level of support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children in the context of the applications received for the 2012/13 school year.It is important to note that a school's allocation of SNA support may alter from year to year as pupils enrol or leave a school or where a child's care needs have diminished over time.If a school is notified of a change in SNA support this is either because the number of qualifying children has changed or the assessed needs of the qualifying children have changed.The NCSE may only allocate SNAs to schools where valid applications meet the qualifying criteria.SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The NCSE is developing an appeals process which I understand will be in place when the schools re-open in September 2012.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

From June 2011, responsibility for the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 was transferred to the Minster for Children and Youth Affairs.I understand that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has been in contact with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding the issue referred to by the Deputy. I also understand that under the Act the inclusion of the National Council for Special Education within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children would require a draft Order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving this order to be approved by each such House.The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has advised that it intends to consult with my Department and with the Ombudsman for Children before finalising a proposal on this matter.Pending such deliberations, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the NCSE have agreed an interim process through which any concerns which are brought to the attention of the Office will be brought to the direct attention of NCSE for response.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Departments guidance. Similarly, SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	510	Firstly I wish to advise the Deputy that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for Audiology services including screening of children for hearing problems. The Deputy may wish to contact my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children or the HSE directly relating to his query in this regard.The EPSEN and Disability Acts set out clearly the role and functions of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the HSE and their staff in carrying out assessments and with regard to the provision of services for children with special educational needs.My Department, either directly or through the NCSE, provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs, including pupils who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. These supports may include additional Resource Teachers, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and specialist equipment, depending on a child's level of assessed needs.Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support.  The consideration of these  reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. However, whereas health reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, health staff are asked not to include references to the specific quantum of educational resources in their reports, but should state the outcome of tests carried out and the range of needs of the child as clearly as possible.The NCSE circular 03/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category. Seperately the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs.All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received.It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support, including supports allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Departments guidance.

My Department held a preliminary meeting with the Board of Management and its Design Team in May to expedite the progress of the project through Architectural Planning.  Following this meeting my Department is awaiting the submission of stage 1 design works from the Board of Management and their Design team.School building projects, including the one referred to by the Deputy, which have not been included in the five year construction programme, will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	518	My Department has received an application from the school referred to by the Deputy for capital works to provide an extension. Due to the limitations of the school's site, additional land will be required to facilitate an extension. In this regard, my Department is currently in the process of acquiring additional land which is adjacent to two existing schools, one of which is the school referred to by the Deputy. However, due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.The Deputy will appreciate, that in view of the financial constraints imposed by the need, as outlined in the Five Year Plan, to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet demographic demand, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a project for the school in question will be progressed.In the meantime, the school was invited to partake in the Prefab Replacement Initiative. However, for various reasons, the school has indicated that it is unlikely to be in a position to participate in this initiative.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	519	The curriculum in post-primary schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning across all subjects.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. Therefore, it is not time bound.The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.I am currently leading the reform of the Junior Cycle. A Framework for the revised Junior Cycle has been prepared. It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of the Statements of Learning aims to ensure that all students "use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life".The reform will also allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide a new opportunity for schools to progress the provision of short courses to enhance students' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning. Such courses could include software programming and coding, if a school so chooses.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	520	My focus is on supporting schools to provide a high quality of education that enables students to reach their full potential. The Teaching Council Act, 2001 was enacted to promote teaching as a profession, to promote the professional development of teachers and to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State.We issued a Circular (31/2011) to management authorities of post-primary schools in May 2011 which stated that "people appointed to teach are registered teachers with qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are employed".Teachers in Post-Primary schools must provide their relevant qualifications to be registered by the Teaching Council. My Inspectorate carries out a variety of school evaluations which, inter alia, examine the quality of teaching and learning.While I respect the right of parents to make choices for their children's education, I do not believe that it should be necessary to pay for grinds. I recognise that in certain circumstances, such as a prolonged illness, additional tuition may be useful for a child. I also recognise that revision courses, whether organised within schools or outside, can help children with their study, if they build upon previous work.The institutions which give grinds are private commercial enterprises and they do not come under the jurisdiction of my Department. In addition, the right of parents to make choices for their children in relation to their education must be respected.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Encouraging the deployment of high-quality curriculum-relevant digital resources is a clear priority for the ICT in Schools programme. This programme currently delivers a wide range of digital content through the Scoilnet.ie portal, promotes the development of teacher skills in content development and sharing through the national ICT CPD programme, and supports school leaders in developing "elearning plans" for the integration of ICT in teaching and learning in local practice.In this context, I am fully aware of developments in the digital textbook publishing industry and I believe that the digital format has the potential to add significant value to teaching and learning for the future. In the case of textbooks specifically however, it must be recognised that it is publishers rather than my Department which decide how their intellectual property is to be disseminated. I appreciate that this market is in a particularly rapid phase of evolution at the moment, with a range of digital file formats, content licensing models and portable device platforms in active competition.In these circumstances, I do not believe it would be in the best interest of schools for my Department to prescribe a single national model for the integration of ebooks at this moment in time. I believe it is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy in deciding whether to recommend their pupils purchase ebooks and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice over the medium and long terms. I know that a number of schools have already begun to trial the use of different kinds of ebooks on a local basis. I am pleased to see schools taking such steps, and I would remind them that they may choose to allocate the existing book grant provided by my Department towards purchase of electronic books if they so wish.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form and supporting documentation, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student should qualify for a maintenance grant.Officials in my Department have been in contact with SUSI which has confirmed that an application was received from this student on 13 June 2012. The student will be notified directly of the outcome in due course.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The building project referred to by the Deputy is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The Stage 2(b) submission (Detailed Design) was submitted to my Department in May and is currently under review.Schools which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.However, due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements it has not been possible to advance all school building projects concurrently.To ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the next 5 years, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most future demographic growth will be concentrated.In the meantime, for works that are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to consider if the works in question might qualify for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  Details of the Scheme, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on my Department's website at www.education.ie.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the budgetary and staffing resources available to my Department.SENOs are currently notifying schools of their Resource Teaching and SNA allocations for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.The NCSE has published information in relation to resource teaching and SNA allocations on a county by county and school by school basis on its website www.ncse.ie.  The information requested by the Deputy is therefore available on the NCSE website.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	536	An application was submitted by Cork County Council in May, 2012 under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for funding to undertake works at the location concerned.Following an examination of the application and supporting documentation, the OPW concluded that the structure that collapsed and adjacent structures are not primarily coastal erosion protection structures.  They would be classified more correctly as slope stabilisation, facing and /or retaining structures which are necessary to stabilise the very high and steep slopes seaward of the road. In our view this application has nothing to do with preventing flooding.The funding of repairs to such structures for the mitigation of landslides does not fall within the remit of the OPW. The OPW has written to Cork County Council advising them of this.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The Government has reaffirmed the key commitments under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 in relation to pay and job security for serving public servants.  These commitments are contingent on delivery of the necessary flexibilities and reforms to public service delivery that are required under the Agreement.  The Budget process has outlined the Exchequer expenditure programme for 2012 and the necessary allocations have been made to Departments.  Any further Budgetary measures, should they arise, are a matter for consideration by Government.  The vast majority of persons who are on incremental pay scales are the lower paid and people who have been recruited to the public service more recently.  I reiterate my view that there are fairer ways to control the cost of public pay, given that only a proportion of public servants, in particular lower paid and front line staff, would be affected by a suspension of increments.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	538	The proposal referred to in the Deputy's question, does not comprise part of the Government's programme of constitutional reform contained in the Programme for Government or the work programme recently announced for the Constitutional Convention by the Taoiseach.  As the Deputy may be aware, in his statement on the issues to be to be examined by the Constitutional Convention the Taoiseach stated that the Government is aware that there have been calls for a more comprehensive work programme for the Convention but the Government's view is that the Convention should deal first with the specific topics in the Programme for Government.  The Taoiseach also said that Government is prepared to consider whether other topics could be considered at a later date in the light of experience, and that he will consult with Opposition representatives and the Chairperson of the Convention at the appropriate time.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The purpose of EU Regional/Cohesion policy is to reduce the significant economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist between Europe's regions.  The budget for the 2007-2013 round is €347bn.  Most of this budget is allocated for those countries and regions whose gross domestic product per capita is less than 75% of EU average (81.5% for convergence objective).  The remainder is for all other countries and regions (16.5% for regional competitiveness and employment objective) and for cooperation across borders (2.5% for territorial cooperation objective).  The overall budget and country allocation is agreed between the EU Commission and Member States in advance of the programming period.Ireland has been allocated in total €901m in Structural Funding for the 2007-13 Programming period with €750 million assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) Objective.  Ireland's National Strategic Reference Framework (approved by the European Commission in July 2007) sets out the strategic context within which the €750m block of funding may be applied; the delivery is via three operational programmes, the National ESF Human Capital Investment OP, managed by the Department of Education and Skills, and the Border Midland and Western (BMW) and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF (S&E) OPs, managed by the BMW and S&E Regional Assemblies.  The balance of €151m   is for smaller Territorial Cooperation programmes including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.For the purposes of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, Ireland is designated into two NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) II regions, namely the BMW Region and the S&E Region.  Of the €750 million allocated to Ireland under the RCE, €458 million has been allocated to the BMW Region (due to its phasing in status — moving from convergence (less developed) to regional competitiveness and employment (more developed) status) and €292 million to the S&E Region.The future of Cohesion policy is being framed in the context of the current economic downturn, and the challenge of an integrated Cohesion policy is to address this.  Ireland agrees that Cohesion policy will be a key policy instrument in achieving the EU 2020 Strategy Priorities for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth.  This will set the strategic direction for future policy.  My strong view is that interventions must be focused on employment, research and innovation, education, combating poverty, climate change and energy.The Commission last year published its proposals for the next round of funding covering the period 2014-2020.  The Commission's proposal is to allocate €376bn to Cohesion policy instruments, an increase on the allocation for 2007-2013.  This proposal must be seen in the context of the wider negotiations on the EU Budget, however, where there will be pressure to reduce the overall size of the budget.The breakdown of the Commission's proposal is set out in the table.Total proposed budget 2014-2020 Of which€376 bnConvergence regions·Transition regionsCompetitiveness regionsTerritorial cooperationCohesion fundExtra allocation for outermost and sparsely populated regions€162.6 bn€39 bn€53.1 bn€11.7 bn€68.7 bn€926 millionConnecting Europe Facility for transport, energy and ICT€40 bn plus €10 bn ring fenced inside the Cohesion FundMy aim will be to maximize Ireland's allocation and ensure that we continue to benefit from Cohesion policy.  I have been arguing strongly that Cohesion funding has had a major impact on key economic and social programmes throughout the country and that funding for 2014-2020 must be maintained to help secure Ireland's recovery.

The expenditure incurred in the provision of services through the Irish Language in the year ended 31 December 2011 was €4870.98.  To date in 2012 expenditure in the amount of €1199.37 has been incurred.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The estimates allocation and overall budgetary process will set out the approach to be taken to Government expenditure in 2013.  This framework does not assign specific savings targets to those areas that are covered by the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.  However, Paragraph 1.16 of the Agreement does provide for an annual review of the savings generated from its implementation.  Two such reviews have been undertaken by the Implementation Body for the Agreement to date.  On 13th June last, the Body published its Second Annual Progress Report in respect of Year 2 of the Agreement (12 months ending March 2012) which found, inter alia, that:Pay bill Savings of €650m were achieved during the year under review (Apr 2011 to Mar 2012) driven largely by the reduction in staff numbers, or €521m net of an estimate for the maximum possible post-February recruitment over 2012.  An estimated €810m in sustainable pay bill savings has therefore been achieved during the first two years of the Agreement.Administrative efficiency (or ‘non-pay') savings totalling €370m were reported for the review period.  Adding non-pay savings presented in last year's Report totalling €308m, gives a total of €678m in non-pay savings in the first two years of the Agreement.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The Government Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 contains the commitment to establish a new model of financing social interventions — called Social Impact Bonds — that share audited exchequer savings with charitable and voluntary organisations (Section 2.13.4), as well as a commitment to examine outcomes-based contracts with community organisations to help reduce re-offending by young people, based on the social impact bond model in the U.K. (section 3.33.5).  Social impact investing works by identifying public sector benefits that can be achieved by tackling social problems early and raising private capital to fund these interventions up-front.  The State will only agree to repay investors if agreed outcomes are achieved.An Advisory Group, chaired by the former Secretary General of the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Mr. Gerry Kearney, was established in August 2011 to explore the potential for social impact investing in Ireland.  My department was represented on the Advisory Group.  The group has been assisted by a project team consisting of members from Clann Credo — the Social investment Fund, the Centre for Effective Services and Social Finance Ltd (a UK based promoter of social impact investing).  A scoping exercise was conducted by the project team under the guidance of the advisory group to help assess the potential of social impact investing in Ireland.  The conclusion is that social impact investing is both desirable and feasible in Ireland subject to piloting some projects that have emerged from the scoping exercise as projects that are likely to provide improved social outcomes than can deliver social value and public sector benefits.The scoping exercise undertaken by the Advisory Group is a welcome piece of work which has identified some opportunities which have the potential to progress to pilot social impact investment projects.  I consider that if these opportunities are to progress further to a formal pilot phase then the senior management of the relevant government departments and agencies will have to carry out a full assessment of the proposals and recommend whether or not a project should proceed to a formal pilot phase.  That assessment should have regard to what the appropriate outcomes are, what metrics should be put in place to measure outcomes, what financing arrangements are appropriate for particular projects and other due diligence and legal arrangements that are appropriate.My department has written to the departments seeking their assessment of the projects relevant to them; how they measure up, what additional exchequer savings are achievable from the proposed interventions and how, and by whom, they should be measured and monitored.  Given that cross-departmental and cross-agency issues may arise in some of the potential pilot projects, how such issues and arrangements are dealt with also needs to be considered and addressed.A steering committee will be established to oversee this next stage of development.  This committee will be charged with assessing the responses from departments and overseeing the organisational arrangements that are necessary to deliver social impact investment projects.  The committee will include representatives from the Advisory Group who have overseen the scoping work to date and representatives from line departments under whose aegis potential projects are being considered for the next stage as well as representatives from this Department.

Prior to 2006, disciplinary and dismissal procedures were as set out in Circular 1/1992.  Under these procedures, it was the responsibility of the Government to decide whether a civil servant should be dismissed.  Under these procedures, my Department submitted each case to the Government and so had an overview of the number of dismissals in the Civil Service.  During the period 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2006, there were 15 dismissals under these procedures.  During the period 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2011, there were four dismissals under these procedures. In the latter period where disciplinary proceedings had already commenced prior to 4 July 2006, the case continued to be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures in Circular 1/1992.  Under the provisions in the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, each Secretary General/Head of Office has the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out a range of duties in their Departments/Offices.  Among these are the management of all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of Principal.  The Disciplinary Code was revised in July 2006 to reflect the legislative changes and procedures for discipline and dismissals are now detailed in Circular 14/2006.  Therefore, my Department is not generally consulted about discipline and dismissals cases as it was in the past under the previous Code (Circular 1/1992).

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	555	As I explained in my reply of 22 May 2012, Ireland has been allocated a total of €901 million in EU Structural Funding for the period 2007-13.  Of this, €750 million is assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective, and the balance to Territorial Co-operation programmes, including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.  Ireland's national strategic reference framework, which was agreed with the Commission in 2007, sets out the strategic direction for investment of the funds in Ireland under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective.  This is being delivered through three operational programmes — the National ESF Human Capital Investment operational programme, which is managed by the Department of Education and Skills, and the Border, Midland and Western and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF operational programmes, which are managed by the two regional assemblies.  The general programme priorities in Ireland are the promotion and encouragement of innovation, the knowledge economy, enterprise, research and development, increasing activation of the labour force and increasing the participation and reducing inequality in the labour force.Each operational programme has an indicative financial plan which sets out how the funds will be spent over the programming period at priority level.  It should be noted that there is a time lag between expenditure being incurred and a claim for reimbursement being submitted to Brussels as there is a certification, verification and audit process to be completed to ensure compliance with the regulations.  Flexibility is allowed under the regulations to move funding within and between priorities under each OP. It should be noted that the eligibility period is 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2015.  I attach for the Deputy's information for each operational programme on the total amounts allocated to date at priority/sub-priority/theme level; and the indicative financial plans at priority level.  While it is not possible at this point in the programming period to identify the specific projects which will benefit from co-financing, the indicative sub-priority/themes are set out in the table provided to the Deputy.  It is expected that the overall objectives of each programme will be achieved and that Ireland will drawdown all the funding we have been allocated.

People being proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State bodies or agencies may be required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they will take to their role as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question.  Following that discussion, decisions will be taken by either the Government or myself, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as chairperson.  In the case of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, the new procedures were not used and the Chairman was not interviewed by Oireachtas.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service, the Permanent Defence Forces, the Garda and teachers sets out the nomination process for the board and its appointment by the Government.Name of AppointeeDate Appointed/Re-appointedMr. Eddie Sullivan, ChairmanMr. Des Dowling, Assistant Secretary — Department of the Environment, Community and Local GovernmentDr. Deirdre O’Keeffe, Assistant Secretary — Department of Justice and EqualityMs Patricia Coleman, Director — Department of Public Expenditure and ReformMr. Seán McGrath — National Director of HR in the HSE (has since resigned)Ms Judith Eve — former Chairperson the Civil Service Commissioners, Northern IrelandDr. Eddie Molloy — Management ConsultantMr. Dan Murphy, former General Secretary of the PSEUMr. Bryan Andrews as CEO of the PAS holding office on an ex officio basis. Replaced by Ms Fiona Tierney, CEO, PAS1 September 201120th March 2012 — on appointment as CEOThe appointments were not made using the new procedures and the previous Chairman was reappointed to the role on the new board.  The reason for not following the new procedures in relating to board appointments is that the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 states that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in consultation with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence) should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service.  The Board is meant to be representative of our client base.  The majority of the board is therefore civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  There is also a union representative nominated by ICTU.  I reappointed the outgoing Chairman and the two external members were appointed by me because of their expertise in strategic change and public service recruitment respectively.

Reductions in fee levels are being achieved through a number of different measures.  In accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and the Government decision of 3 February 2009 which provided for an 8% reduction in professional fees payable by Government Departments and State Agencies, an 8% reduction to all legal fees with effect from 1 March 2009 was applied to Legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor's Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution's Office; Payment of Witness Expenses; State Solicitors fees (this came into effect on 5th May 2009); Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees including barrister, private practitioner, medical and legal fees; and Tribunal fees.  Subsequently, on foot of budget 2010, a further 8% reduction with effect from 1 January 2010 was applied to legal counsel fees in the Chief State Solicitor's Office; Brief and Refresher fees in the Director of Public Prosecution's Office; and Criminal and Civil Legal Aid fees.In more recent times, this path has been pursued further.  A fee reduction of 10% on Criminal Legal Aid fees was applied with effect from 13 July 2011 and 1 October 2011 for District, and Circuit and Higher Courts, respectively.  Changes in the structure of the day 1 fee in the District Court, a reduction of 50% in the rate paid in respect of travel and subsistence and a reduction of 50% in the rate paid for sentence fees in respect of adjourned sentence hearings in the Circuit and higher courts were also applied.  A pre-approval process prior to engaging expert witnesses and a time limit of 24 months for submission of fee claims were introduced.  In October 2011, a further 10% reduction was applied to brief and refresher fees paid by the Director of Public Prosecution' Office to reduce the level of fees in parallel with the reductions applied to fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.  A further 10% reduction was applied to Tribunal fees on 1 March 2012.  The Legal Aid Board has served notice on the Bar Council of its withdrawal from the existing agreement with the Bar Council on Civil Legal Aid fees and its adoption of new arrangements which will have the effect, over time, of significantly reducing fees payable to barristers.Enhanced mechanisms for rigorous examination of claims have also been introduced in both the Chief State Solicitor's and the Director of Public Prosecution's Offices.  In relation to procurement policy, the position is that legal services are not exempt from public procurement rules and many authorities tender for their legal services.  To raise awareness in this regard, my Department, following consultations with the Attorney General's Office, will shortly issue a circular underlining the importance of competitive tendering for such services to all public bodies.  In addition, the National Procurement Service set up a working group on legal services earlier this year to examine ways to assist public bodies that procure legal services and to examine how resources can be leveraged to achieve best value for money.  The Working Group consists of representatives from the National Procurement Service, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Attorney General.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The total expenditure by my Department and its Offices in relation to the provision of services through the Irish language in each of the past five years is as follows: 2008, €63,872; 2009, €85,350; 2010, €42,461; 2011, €48,424; and 2012, €12,989 (to date).  The recorded expenditure in 2009 was higher than in other years, due in part to the translation into the Irish language of information leaflets; new forms and website content for the Companies Registration Office.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Current Government policy is to issue new employment permits in respect of jobs requiring key skills, where there is a recognised scarcity of suitably skilled workers.  A significant range of job categories within the technology and related sectors are eligible across the employment permit schemes.  The issue of any employment permit is predicated on a job offer from a prospective Irish employer who has made every effort to recruit an Irish or EEA national for the post.  In considering applications, the Department takes cognisance of applications submitted with the support of the IDA.  For specified highly skilled and strategically important occupations, where a skills shortage exists, Green Card employment permits may be issued.  The Green Card permit is issued to the employee and allows his or her employment in the State by the named employer in the occupation specified on the permit. It may be issued for a period of two years.  The employee may apply for immediate family reunification and an application for long-term residence may be made after two years.  No labour market needs test (e.g. newspaper and FÁS/EURES advertising) is required prior to making an application.  Sensibly, it is a requirement that no more than 50% of staff employed by a company in Ireland may be employment permits holders.The Department also operates an Intra-Company Transfer (ICT) scheme.  This scheme is designed to facilitate the transfer of senior management, key personnel or trainees who are foreign nationals from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to its Irish branch.  Only 5% of the workforce may have ICT Permits.  However for startups this may be waived on a case by case basis for an initial period.  No labour market needs test is required in respect of an application for an Intra-Company Transfer permit.  Certain criteria apply in the case of ICTs.  Application forms and information in relation to the criteria that apply in the case of all employment permit types including green cards and ICTs are available on my Department's website.  The Government has no plans at present to lift employment permits restrictions for non-EU nationals nor is there evidence that the current policy impedes inward investment.  Visas are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.

New work permit applications can only be considered where it is established that the position has been advertised with FÁS/EURES for a period of 8 weeks and that this advertisement has been flagged as a work permit vacancy and advertised for at least six days in both local and national newspapers.Finally, it also appeared from the information provided that this employee was already working for the company without having a valid employment permit and that the company had no other employees.The applicant was notified of this decision in writing and of their right to appeal this decision within 21 days. As no appeal was received in the Employment Permits Section this matter is now at an end. However it is open to the applicant to make a new application in this instance, addressing in particular the issues raised at the time of refusal the matter will be given further consideration.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 308 together.In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government has identified a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets, including the area of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) which takes in call centres.  Ireland has an opportunity to operate as a Centre of Excellence for BPO and Shared Services specifically targeting key knowledge intensive services and building domain expertise, e.g. Community Management and Analytics (games), Document Management Services for regulated sectors, Contract Research Outsourcing and Legal Process Outsourcing.The customer contact industry continues to be an invaluable source of employment creation from multinational companies locating in Ireland across a range of industry sectors including finance, IT, life sciences and e-commerce.  As an increasingly important component in the way companies differentiate themselves, the customer contact centre has evolved into a multi-functional, multi-lingual environment, an early adaptor of new digital technologies and servicing a global customer base.   According to the Contact Centre Management Association of Ireland (CCMA), which has carried out research (published in 2011) into the role of contact centres throughout Ireland, the sector employs more than 29,000 people, with a spread of over 100 contact centre operations nationwide.   CCMA findings show very positive results against the backdrop of a challenging economic climate and emphasise a focus on growth and business retention within the sector.IDA Ireland has a value proposition to attract customer support companies to locate in Ireland as part of its overall strategy to attract FDI.  This strategy has proven successful and Ireland is now home to a broad range of companies based in different industries servicing multiple markets.  Examples of such companies include Google, Facebook, Lufthansa,Cook Medical, Hertz, EMC, Merrill Lynch, EA Games and Riot Games.  Recent announcements by Paypal and Zenimax further endorse the successful strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland.Many large scale indigenous firms have ‘in-house' contact centres to service their customer base.  These include firms such as VHI, Aer Lingus, UPC and range from small scale to larger scale.  They offer services direct to consumers ranging from reservations, to problem solution, cross selling and up-selling.  In addition, a number of indigenous call centre operations have grown substantially in the last ten years.  Enterprise Ireland currently supports 14 Irish companies in the space that employ approximately 4,000 people.

The Competition Acts 2002 to 2010 set out the requirements pertaining to appointments to the Authority. Chairperson: I re-appointed Mr. Declan Purcell as Chairperson of the Competition Authority on 1st   July 2011 and following his retirement, I subsequently appointed Ms Isolde Goggin as Chairperson following her selection by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who publicly advertised this position.  I appointed Ms Noreen Mackey and Mr. David McFadden as temporary members of the Authority in July 2011 and I subsequently re-appointed both from 1st October.

In this respect, my overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments. In making appointments I will have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21660	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	571	Mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements that allow for the legal extension of voluntarily negotiated collective agreements throughout a particular sector are widespread in almost all EU Member States. In the 21 EU Member States where it is legally possible to extend collective bargaining agreements universally across a particular sector, such extension is normally conditional on arrangements for establishing the consent of the parties and their representative status through specific conditions or thresholds that must be met before a collective agreement can be extended throughout a sector.In most instances the test used to establish whether employers are representative is to focus on the number of workers in the particular class, type or group that are employed by the employers subscribing to the agreement affecting that category.  This is the test that has been introduced in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 and is given further emphasis as a priority consideration in any decision to register a sectoral agreement.The issues of uncertainty that have arisen regarding the interpretation of the statutory requirement in Section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, were the subject of a detailed commentary and of several recommendations in the Report of the Independent Review of  Employment Regulation Orders And Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms (The Duffy Walsh Report). The commentary in the Report outlined how the original provision in Section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 regarding the representativeness of the parties to an agreement had given rise to controversy, especially in scenarios where a group of employers might constitute a minority of the total number of relevant employers but could, nonetheless, employ the majority of the workers normally employed within the relevant sector.In this context, the Government accepted the recommendations made by the Independent Review for changes to be made to the provisions of Section 27 of the Act of 1946 to provide that the question of whether a party an agreement is substantially representative should dependin the case of trade unions, on the degree to which they are representative of workers to whom the agreement relates which should be measured by reference to the union's membership in the employment or sector concerned.in the case of employers or employer organisation, the extent to which they could be regarded as representative which should be weighted by size, measured by the number of employees normally employed.Accordingly, Section 27 of the Act of 1946 is amended by the 2011 Bill to give effect to this.While there is a statutory requirement in the Act of 1946 that the parties to an REA are substantially representative of the industry to which it relates at the time of registration there is currently no requirement that they remain representative. Accordingly, Section 29 of the 1946 Act is being amended to address this anomaly and provides that the Labour Court may cancel the registration of an REA where it is satisfied that either the trade union(s) or employer parties have ceased to be substantially representative of workers or employers in the sector to which the agreement relates.

This figure represents a reduction of approximately 5% on 2010 occupational pension coverage figures.   However, it does not include the latest figure of 198,028 for those with Personal Retirement Savings Accounts which has increased by almost 11,000 on 2010 levels.A decline in occupational pensions can be expected due to the increase in unemployment and contractions in the economy over recent years. However, the Government is committed to increasing pension coverage and will continue with the implementation of long-term policy aimed at promoting better pensions security and long-term stability of pensions.

This group consists of representatives from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs — which is the lead Department in relation to child care policy and provision — and the Department of Education and Skills.  The role of the group is to quantify the school-age child care needs of social welfare income support recipients, initially for lone parents, and to define the best model for the provision of these services.  The model, and accompanying proposals, will then be submitted to the Government for approval.The model will address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 (inclusive).  The model will also address the school-age child care required during both the school-term and the school holidays.When the youngest child of a lone parent reaches the age of 7, if the parent is still in need of income support, they can apply for a jobseeker's payment — which is paid at the same basic rate as the one parent family payment (OFP) (€188 per week), and which has the same additional increases for each additional qualified child (€29.80 per child per week) — and receive the activation supports attached to that payment.  They will then be profiled and their individual needs will be assessed.  This will facilitate the agreement of a progression plan with these customers, the development of their case management to assist them to either improve on existing skills or learn new ones, and their gradual move towards or entry into the workforce.Should lone parents decide to make an application for jobseeker's allowance (JA) they will have to meet the eligibility criteria of the JA scheme.  At present, this includes that they must genuinely be seeking work.  Specifically in relation to childcare requirements, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides subsidised childcare for low-income families including many social welfare recipients.  An individual who is unemployed can avail of this subsidised childcare.  This programme enables individuals with young children who are in receipt of OFP or JA to seek employment but it also provides them with subsidised childcare should they secure low income employment.In advance of the OFP payment ceasing, lone parents can also apply for the back-to-education allowance (BTEA), the back-to-work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) or, if the parent is in employment of over 19 hours per week, for the family income supplement (FIS), or for another appropriate payment.

The National Employment and Entitlements Service established within the Department will integrate the benefit payments services of the Department with the employment services formerly with FÁS.  This integrated approach is based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.It is the intention of the Department to profile all new applicants for unemployment payments with a view to assessing their probability of exit from the Live Register.  This profiling process is currently being rolled out across the network of the Department's offices and will be completed by the end of October.  This is the first step in developing a case management approach across the network of the Department's offices.The profile of the customer will determine the next set of interactions with them.  These interactions will include a group engagement session to set out both the entitlements and responsibilities of the customer and to schedule them for one to one support.  The group engagement process is underway in a large number of locations and is scheduled to reach the target of 30,000 people receiving this service by the end of 2012.Targeted one to one engagement with customers based on their profile is being rolled out as part of the new NEES offices.  The development of a case management approach will be an iterative process with improvements being developed as the roll out continues across the network of the Department's Offices.  Four offices are currently being prepared to deliver a fully integrated service in Arklow, Sligo, Tallaght and Parnell Street, Dublin.  A further 10 offices are scheduled to deliver the service by the end of the year.

Public and civil servants who had been in employment before 6 April 1995 and continued to be so employed without a break in service were insured at the modified rate of PRSI contribution, Class D, whereas new entrants paid PRSI Class A.Following on from the 6 April 1995 changes, a number of different departments and Boards applied the incorrect rate of PRSI in certain situations.  This resulted in an overpayment of PRSI contributions and an underpayment of pension contributions in respect of the employees concerned.Where the incorrect class of PRSI has been paid the Department of Social Protection refunds the PRSI contributions where the conditions for refund are met.  When a PRSI refund is being calculated any benefits paid to the person on foot of the class A PRSI contributions are deducted from the amount of refund due.The position in relation to the person concerned is that her employer in the Health Services contacted the Department in November 2011 to clarify the correct contribution class for her employment.  It was confirmed that she had been paying the incorrect PRSI class since she was made permanent in 1999.  A refund of PRSI in respect of the PRSI class A contributions was sought.  However, no refund is due in this case as illness benefit paid out exceeds the amount of PRSI refund available.A four year limit on the return of PRSI contributions was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009 and has been in effect since 1 January 2010.  The time limit governing the refund of PRSI contributions is in line with the arrangements of the Revenue Commissioners governing the refund of tax.

These were to:-have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years.have at least 156 paid contribution weeks, since entry into insurance, from employment or self-employment.have a yearly average of at least 10 paid/credited contributions.According to the records of the Department, the person concerned has a yearly average of 4 contributions from 1952 to 1996; therefore, she does not satisfy the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) as outlined.At least one year self-employment contributions must be paid prior to the person reaching pension age in order to be reckonable for a State pension (contributory). However, in this case, the self-employment contributions were only paid after reaching the age of 66 years.

The Scheme aims to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience by providing them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience and acquire relevant knowledge and skills in a working environment.Since the Scheme was launched, nearly 8,200 internship placements have commenced. There are currently 4,899 interns undertaking placements and there are in excess of 2,100 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website —www.jobbridge.ie.Eligibility for the Scheme is currently restricted at those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit, One Parent Family Payment, Disability Allowance or signing for credits for 78 days out of the last 6 months.  Time spent on certain Government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility.  This is to underline the Department's objective which is to prioritise scarce resources at those in receipt of a live claim or on the Live Register with a view to increasing their chances of accessing employment, training and educational opportunities.  The person concerned has been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance since 26 May 2012.  In the circumstances, he will be eligible for a JobBridge placement when he has a claim of 78 days.

Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Funding towards alternative accommodation costs have also been made in certain cases depending on the circumstances of the families.Larger payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as assisting with the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again are also being made. This type of payment will take longer as home owners must first establish the cost of repair and engage a builder to carry out the repairs.From October 2011 to the end of May 2012, a total of 960 payments have been made at a cost of €760,000, with payments averaging at approximately €790. The majority of these payments were made to customers resident in either Dublin or Monaghan.Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the October 2011 floods should contact the local Department of Social Protection representative administering the supplementary allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance. The humanitarian assistance scheme is a non-statutory scheme and is not covered under social welfare legislation.  It is one of a number of social welfare schemes which operates on an administrative basis. Administrative schemes are not appealable under social welfare legislation. However, where a person is dissatisfied with a decision they can request to have their case reviewed by another officer.  This review will be carried out by an officer not involved in the original decision.

In general, this means that the job no longer exists and the person is not replaced.    This can occur where, for example, an employer requires fewer employees to do work of a particular kind, where a company goes into liquidation or receivership, where it is decided to rationalise a company or firm or where a firm simply closes down.According to the information supplied, the person concerned retired early due to ill health.    A person who voluntarily resigns or is dismissed for alleged misconduct or resigns due to ill-health, would not satisfy the legislative conditions governing the redundancy scheme and so could not be viewed to have been dismissed by reason of redundancy.  Accordingly, such a person would not be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment.

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department has  appointed an additional Appeals Officer who will be taking up duty in the coming weeks.  Her appointment brings to 13 the number of additional Appeals Officers appointed since 2010.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration subject to a ceiling of €600.00 per week.  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a partial rebate from the State.  Where an employer can prove an inability to pay statutory redundancy payments to its eligible employees, lump sum payments are paid directly to those employees.  Both rebates and lump sums are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  While the Social Insurance Fund is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers' contribution is also significant.  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  €152.2 million was paid out in rebates to employers in 2006; €167.4 million was paid in 2007; €161.8 million was paid in 2008; €247.9 million in 2009; €373.2 million in 2010 and €185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.One of the factors which influenced the Government's decision to revise the rebate rate was the significant cost.  In the context of the Budget 2012 deliberations it was decided that the 60% rebate was not sustainable in the current economic climate.   As a result, the level of the rebate was reduced to 15% where the date of dismissal for the purposes of redundancy occurred on or after 1 January 2012.  In the case of the company concerned the redundancies occurred after that date.  While the reduction in the rebate rate may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.

Currently the average time taken to award a carer's allowance application is 28 weeks. There are approximately 8,650 new carer's allowance applications registered and awaiting a decision.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking action to resolve the situation.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers.  Significant internal resources have been invested in the development and rollout of the new computer system over the past 18 months or so. Full deployment of the new system for carer's allowance has now completed.  In tandem with this implementation of the new system, a comprehensive business process improvement exercise has recently commenced, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.As previously advised every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant and in a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.  While documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place, and being availed of, before a decision can be made, it is a matter for the officer administering the scheme to determine the form of documentation required having regard to the specifics of each case.

The company employs 10 full-time employees which allows them to facilitate one intern at any one time.  It is a stipulation of the JobBridge programme that once an internship has surpassed 3 months in duration and the host organisation have reached their quota they cannot, without first hiring a paid employee, avail of another intern in the same broad area of activity until a 6 month cooling-off period has elapsed.  This is an important obligatory clause which serves to restrict the possibility of host organisations engaging interns on a rolling basis to offset the need to fill an opening with a salaried employee.

Where a benefit recipient is working part-time or in casual employment their benefit entitlement will be calculated with reference to a 5 day, rather than a 6 day, week.  In line with other Budget measures the effect of this measure will not impact on any person whose sole income is from social welfare.  It will only apply to those who have earned additional income from working some days during the week.The effect of this measure will be to reduce the contribution from jobseeker's benefit to the weekly amount of total income and help towards a reduction in the reliance on the welfare system among those who currently avail of a mix of welfare and earned income.  As a savings measure, the change will reduce costs within the jobseeker's benefit scheme but the scheme will continue to deliver incentives towards additional employment for part-time and casual workers.  It is important to note that the measure applies to jobseeker's benefit only and that recipients of jobseeker's benefit may opt for jobseeker's allowance, which is subject to a means test.  This measure will be implemented from 26 July 2012.The Budget also provided for the inclusion of Sunday working when calculating the amount of jobseeker's benefit/allowance payable.  This measure is due to be implemented in 2013.

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Bill.  In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  The Department has also sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the main issues arising in the context of these meetings.  These discussions, and the advice that is received from the Office of the Attorney General, will continue to inform the drafting of the Heads of the Bill.It is not possible to be definitive at this stage about when I will be in a position to introduce legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons as the issues are complex.  Upon receipt of the legal advice sought, the Department will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the completion of the draft Heads of the Bill.

This allows applicants to retain ownership of their land holding or rights, while availing of compensation.  Officials from my Department wrote to the individual referred to in the Deputy's Question in April to offer him this option, if he wished.As contracts for sale had been received by my Department, these have recently been forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's Office to progress the sale.

Active raised bog (habitat type 7110), which is a priority habitat under the Habitats Directive, is the area where conditions are right for typical species of raised bog flora and fauna to thrive and for peat to form.  This area is very sensitive to drainage arising from turf-cutting and other pressures. Turf-cutting directly removes one protected habitat type — degraded raised bog still capable of natural regeneration  —   and reduces the area of active raised bog through its effects on the water levels on the high bog.  The report noted that while only 1-2% of the high bog had been cut away over the study period, the impact on active raised bog was far more dramatic.  The face bank cutting causes direct drainage effects on the adjacent high bog and further drainage is required to dry the spreadground.  These drainage effects severely impact active raised bog and evidence of this impact can be regularly observed several hundred meters from the face bank.Areas of active raised bogs may be restored through blocking drains and other works so that peat formation conditions return — that is, if bogs are not damaged beyond repair.  Peat lost by cutting would take thousands of years to recover.  Continued cutting and drainage makes restoration more difficult and, unless action is taken now, it is clear that much of Ireland's remaining raised bog habitat will be irrevocably lost.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 409 together.Responsibility for the regulation of natural gas prices is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Bord Gáis Energy's (BGE) gas tariffs for domestic customers continue to be regulated by the CER and reviewed each year.  I have no function in the matter.The largest component of gas prices is the wholesale price of gas.  While the international cost of gas fell in 2008 and 2009, wholesale gas prices have been trending significantly upwards in Europe since late 2010.  This is driven by geopolitical events in the Middle East and high demand in Asia including Japan in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear incident.The value of the Euro has decreased considerably against Sterling over the last year.  This is a key driver for the likely upward pressure on gas prices given that Ireland purchases virtually all of its gas from Great Britain.  Other price pressures include increased financing costs of the networks for BGE, reflecting the high cost of borrowing due to the financial crisis, as well as a reduction in gas volumes as a result of the economic crisis.The CER and BGE estimate that as a consequence of these factors the increases in wholesale prices are likely to result in increases in gas prices for Irish customers, in October.  The extent of the increase has not been quantified as yet.  The CER decision to increase regulated gas prices in October 2011 (21.72%) was the first increase in gas prices since September 2008.Over the coming months the CER will complete its detailed annual review of the BGE tariff.  This will involve assessment by the CER of BGE's own submission on gas prices, which has just been received, followed by a consultation beginning in mid July.  The level of the likely variation in the tariff will not become clear until BGE's detailed submission is analysed.  A decision by the CER is likely to follow at the end of August on whether any variation should be applied to the tariff from 1st October next.  In making its decision, the CER will only allow efficient costs and will make every effort to ensure consumers are protected as much as possible.  The objective is to ensure that tariffs are cost reflective.Customers can help reduce the impact of rising prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers.  They can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their gas usage which delivers demonstrable savings.  The CER is also working with gas suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance of gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's Energy Affordability Strategy are also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers.  Ireland is, however, a price taker for gas and the outlook for the European gas market is for a continued rise in the commodity price.  Currency exchange trends will continue to have a significant impact, either positive or negative, on gas prices for Ireland.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	647	The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1934 was enacted for the purpose of ESB further developing the water-storage capacity of Lough Derg, Lough Ree, and Lough Allen on the River Shannon.  This legislation remains in effect.  There was no statutory order issued specifically in 1979 in respect of Lough Ree.The 1934 Act allows ESB to draw the water level in Lough Ree to a minimum level of what is referred to as ‘36.88m OD Poolbeg'.  OD Poolbeg stands for Ordnance Datum Poolbeg — it is the level above a particular reference point associated with sea level at Poolbeg lighthouse.  ESB use OD Poolbeg as a standard in measuring height above sea level.The level in Lough Ree is about 0.5 m below the level of the weir at Athlone.Before the increase in the use of leisure craft on the river, the lower level was not a significant issue, but with the increase in the use of the river Shannon as a boating amenity, and the use of various creeks and islands on the lake, there were many complaints from boat owners in the late 1960's and early 1970's of low levels in Lough Ree during the boating season.As a consequence, in the early 1970's, ESB agreed to maintain a minimum level in Lough Ree of 37.49m from the beginning of April to mid-August each year, 37.19m from mid August to the beginning of October and 38.66m for the winter period, to facilitate navigation on the lake.  This decision was made in consultation with the then Department of Transport and Power, the OPW and other stakeholders on the Shannon.  This arrangement protects against lake levels going too low for navigation when long dry periods occur.  This agreement was formalised in the ESB regulations for the Shannon in 1979.It should be pointed out that ESB has no interest in maintaining levels in Lough Ree for electricity generation purposes.The weir at Athlone is owned by Waterways Ireland and operated under instruction from ESB.  Its purpose is to assist in maintaining a minimum level on Lough Ree.

As such I have as no role in these matters, including decisions on sites being used for the provision of SAORVIEW.I have however been informed by SAORVIEW that overall coverage in County Cork has improved with the introduction of the digital service.SAORVIEW offers 98% population coverage so by itself fully meets RTÉ's legislative obligations for a replacement national digital TV network to replace the analogue TV network when that switches off on 24 October.As you are aware, RTÉNL gave a presentation at a special briefing I arranged for Oireachtas members on 21st June 2012.  During this briefing the differences between analogue and digital terrestrial transmission were explained, for example, digital uses fewer transmission sites but higher transmission power.  Also the fact that it is not possible to provided 100% coverage of digital terrestrial television was explained.At the same presentation, RTÉNL indicated that SAORVIEW coverage will be further enhanced by the addition of a number of new transmitter sites, including areas of West Cork such as Leap, Bandon, Timoleague, Rosscarbery, Drimoleague, and Mount Gabriel.  These sites will be live from October 1st 2012.  Further information on coverage is available on the SAORVIEW coverage checker on www.saorview.ie.The development and provision of SAORSAT satellite platform is a purely commercial decision by RTÉ and not one in which I have a function.

The report is a detailed document running to almost 130 pages and makes a total of 11 recommendations.  On initial consideration, I can see merit in a number of the recommendations and look forward to discussing the report in more detail in the weeks and months ahead.In relation to taxation, the report recognises there is a balance to be struck between maximising revenue to the State and incentivising companies to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore.  The report goes on to recommend that the rate of tax applying to petroleum production in Ireland should be increased to between 40% and 80%, depending on the profitability of the field.  It seems that factors such as high oil prices and advances in exploration technology were key considerations influencing this recommendation.  However, high oil prices will not make Ireland any more or less attractive as a location for investment, compared to other countries with oil and gas potential.Ireland's petroleum potential is largely unproven and this is likely to remain the case until there is a significant increase in the level of exploration activity from the current level of one to two exploration wells per year.  While I look forward to debating all of the recommendations in the report in more detail, I remain to be convinced how doubling the maximum tax rate will help attract much need exploration investment to Ireland.Question 409 answered with Question No. 402.

The revised fiscal terms provided for a new supplementary tax, known as a profit resource rent tax, of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate already applying.  The revised terms apply to production arising from exploration licences granted since 1 January 2007 and ensure that the return to the State would be up to 40% in the case of very profitable fields.  Standard exploration licence 1/11 (Barryroe) is subject to the provisions of the 2007 Licensing Terms.Ireland's fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration and production are often compared to those of major petroleum countries such as Norway.  Unfortunately this is simply not comparing like with like.  Norway has over 70 producing oil and gas fields while Ireland has only three gas fields with a fourth in development.  Norway is the second largest gas exporter and the seventh largest oil exporter in the world.  Ireland on the other hand imports over 95% of our gas and 100% of our oil requirements.Compared to Norway, Ireland's petroleum potential is largely unproven and this is likely to remain the case until there is a significant increase in the level of exploration activity from the current level of one to two exploration wells per year.  Ireland competes with other countries to attract exploration investment and maintains a licensing regime that reflects the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.  As a result, Ireland's petroleum taxation rate is deliberately pitched at a level that is consistent with countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production, rather than with major petroleum producers such as Norway.Exploring off the west coast of Ireland is expensive due to its remoteness and deep-water depths.  Drilling a single deep-water well in the Atlantic can cost in the region of €80m.  Limited infrastructure (pipelines, terminal and platforms) makes development costly and negatively affects the commerciality of smaller marginal oil and gas discoveries.  Given the high cost and high risk of unsuccessful exploration in the Irish Offshore, it is difficult to make the case that the taxpayer should invest in this high-risk sector at this time.  A State exploration company would have to compete with the private sector for exploration licences and there is no reason to believe that it would be any more successful than private industry in choosing the most prospective areas in which to invest.  On that basis I consider that it is the industry and not the State that should continue to take the risk associated with investment in exploration for oil and gas.

The construction and operation of the East West Interconnector is the statutory responsibility of EirGrid.  The project is on schedule and on budget for completion by September next.  The cost of the Interconnector is underwritten by all electricity customers under the regulatory model implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation.The European Commission is giving strategic priority to strengthening electricity interconnection across Europe.  The strategic importance of the East West Interconnector project was recognised by the Commission with the granting of aid of €110m to EirGrid for the project in 2009 as part of the EU's economic recovery support package for European interconnection and energy infrastructure.The East West Interconnector is a strategically vital energy project for the island of Ireland.  It will critically contribute to national security of energy supply and competition as well as underpinning the progressive development of renewable energy, and the convergence of the electricity markets across these islands.

The Strategy for Renewable Energy sets out five strategic goals — optimising onshore and offshore wind production; building a sustainable bioenergy sector; fostering R&D in renewables such as wave and tidal; growing sustainable transport and building out robust and efficient networks.  In each case the Government has set out the necessary steps to achieve these goals, including the prospect of Ireland to become an exporter of renewable energy.

I welcome the release of these resources for telecommunications purposes and look forward to its contribution towards the development of next generation broadband and communications networks.I should advise the Deputy, however, that the management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 as amended.  ComReg is currently engaged in auctioning the spectrum that will be freed up together with other bandwidths of spectrum.  This will pave the way for delivery by the private sector of significantly enhanced wireless broadband services in Ireland and is a welcome development.Industry has advised through the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce that headline speeds of 30Mbps will be possible over the coming years and will be facilitated by the availability of spectrum released as a consequence of the analogue switch off.

Accordingly, neither I, as Minister, nor my Department has a role in the consultation process referred to by the Deputy or in the actual drawing up of such codes.The Audiovisual Media Services Directive obliges Member States to encourage broadcasters to develop codes of conduct regarding commercial communications for products containing fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars, which accompany or are included in children's programmes.On a national level, Section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 obliges the BAI to prepare and monitor compliance with certain broadcasting codes, including the Children's Commercial Communications Code, as well as reviewing these codes from time to time.  In line with this legislative obligation, the BAI commenced the process of reviewing this section of the Children's code, publishing an initial consultation document in August of last year.Having analysed the responses to the original consultation document, the BAI published a Draft Code at the end of March, for a further phase of public consultation which ran until the end of May.  This Draft Code has been informed by the submissions to the original consultation, by the BAI's regulatory obligations and by the conclusions and recommendations of the Expert Working Group.On foot of correspondence received previously from the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA), my Department has been in contact with the BAI and neither I, nor my Department, believe that any conflict of interest arises.I understand that the Authority has now received all of the submissions to the consultation, including that of the IFA and its concerns regarding the process.  The Authority is obliged to have due regard to all submissions and will accordingly take into account all comments made in respect of its proposed regulation and the approach it has taken to the consultation process.The health of Irish children should be a matter of central concern, and a robust, fair and balanced set of codes around advertising food to children has a key role to play in dealing with a range of childhood and lifelong illnesses.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	663	There are at present no specific conditions set down in legislation with regard to distances from sensitive properties — including houses — in respect of the siting of wind turbines.The issue was considered during the preparation of the existing Wind Energy Guidelines, published by my Department in 2006.  It was decided then that it would be impractical and inappropriate to set a minimum distance because distance alone does not dictate noise levels arising from wind energy development. A wide range of other factors can also impact on noise including;background noise levels,topography,local climatic factors andtype and height  of turbine.Instead the Guidelines state that "in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 metres".  The Guidelines also advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbines proposed in a particular development will use best current engineering practice in terms of noise creation and suppression and provide quite specific limits in the permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments in order to protect neighbouring properties.  The current system therefore provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while also leaving the final decision in the hands of the local decision makers — who have the benefit of any submissions or observations from third parties — in making their decision.I do not propose, therefore, to deal with this matter in legislation.  Generally, matters of technical detail such as noise or electromagnetic interference are dealt with under planning guidelines or in the development management sections of development plans thereby allowing for these issues to be properly addressed in the local context. Guidelines allow for the establishment of flexible parameters within which developments can take place that take account of changing circumstances and technical advances.

A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.  A consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.I expect to be in a position to finalise proposals for Government in relation to household waste collection in the coming weeks.  All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives, including the matter of waivers for low income households.

The draft brief is currently under consideration and is the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and the Council's regeneration project team.  A meeting has been scheduled for 5 July 2012 with the objective of addressing some outstanding issues in relation to the content of the brief.The masterplan will provide a vision for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the Eastern Quadrant of Sligo and set out a framework for delivering on the objectives of the plan.  It will be a matter for the masterplanning process to determine the nature, scope and level of regeneration within the Eastern Quadrant and to outline the strategies and implementation plans for delivering all three strands of regeneration.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate what specific areas the masterplan will recommend for regeneration.While the preparation of the project brief is an executive function, the masterplanning process will involve extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders including community and business interests and statutory bodies. It is a matter for the Borough Council and their consultants to determine how best to provide for stakeholder consultation, including consultation with elected members.

Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis GroupA phased transition is proposed to ensure continuity of service and the building of a fit for purpose organisation within a reasonable timescale, and it is also expected that Irish Water will maintain a strong regional and local focus for operational delivery.  Service level agreements will be put in place between Irish Water and local authorities and these arrangements will be in place until 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period. The Department has had initial engagement with ICTU, and there will be continued engagement with staff and Trade Unions in the rollout of the proposed changes.Work is now focused on the development of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning, including human resource issues, in more detail. The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with  relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.  The rollout of the strategy will also involve co-operation with local authorities and staff to ensure that the change is managed well.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Our current reliance on landfill as the primary waste treatment method is unsustainable. Ireland must comply with challenging targets under the EU Landfill Directive with regard to the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill or face referral to the European Court of Justice for the possible imposition of fines.The landfill levy is chargeable on waste presented for disposal at landfill facilities.  The increase in the levy from €50 per tonne to €65 per tonne came into effect on 1 July 2012. This increase sends a further strong price signal to the producers, collectors and managers of waste, to deter against unsustainable behaviour and to encourage a shift away from landfill to waste management practices which are more closely aligned with the higher tiers of the waste hierarchy.  A further increase in the levy is also planned, to €75 per tonne in July 2013. I hope to see significantly improved levels of prevention, recovery, recycling and reuse of waste as a consequence of these increases.  Assistance to both householders and businesses in reducing their generation of waste, and thus their costs, is available through the National Waste Prevention Programme, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.The latest available data from the Environmental Protection Agency's National Waste Report 2010 states that 0.184 tonnes of household waste per person was sent to landfill in 2010.  This equates to 0.497 tonnes per household (based on the average Irish household size of 2.7 persons), which would indicate an average increased cost per household of approximately €7.50 per annum due to the change in the landfill levy rate.  However, this does not take account of the dissuasive effect of the levy increase referred to above, the intention of which is to encourage prevention and recycling and therefore decrease the amount of waste generated per household which falls subject to the levy, and reduce the impact of the levy increase on waste charges.As the waste collection market is currently structured, the pricing schemes used by private waste collectors are a matter for determination as between the service providers and consumers of the service, subject, of course, to a service provider's collection permit and other legal responsibilities being complied with. Any consumer who is dissatisfied with the service currently provided to them may consider switching to an alternative service provider, although this may not always be a realistic option in certain areas. I would encourage consumers to seek full information from their service provider in relation to any increases to their charges, particularly in relation to the amount of waste collected and how much of their waste is being sent by the collector to landfill. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service, a system otherwise known as ‘franchise-bidding.'I expect to be in a position to finalise proposals for Government in relation to household waste collection in the coming weeks. All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives, including the matter of waivers for low income households.An objective of any such policy will be to help ensure that households and service providers are incentivised to behave in a sustainable fashion — pricing structures more closely aligned with the polluter pays principle are one such method of driving improved environmental performance.

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) administers the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March 2012.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.The exemptions from payment of the household charge are—Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concern—Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.While there is no waiver scheme based on inability to pay included in the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011, the Act does place collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.   Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.As group water schemes are privately owned, they can only be taken over on a permanent basis by Water Services Authorities at the request of the scheme.  This approach will remain the same when Irish Water is established.  The Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector.Work is now focused on the development of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail. This strategy will provide the platform for dealing with a broad range of implementation issues during the transitional phase, including dealing with matters which cross the boundaries between Irish Water functions in relation to water services and those functions which will remain the responsibility of local authorities or other State bodies which impact on the water environment, including issues impacting on group water schemes.The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, Bord Gáis and NewERA.  The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.

I understand that the windows in the dwelling referred to were recently replaced by the local authority.Under the Building Regulations 1997, there are no requirements for windows in residential apartments to have window locks nor are there requirements for such windows to have safety restrictors.  However, for certain types of dwelling houses where a window is to be used as an alternative means of escape or for rescue purposes, Technical Guidance Document B — Fire Safety (2006) provides that the opening section of the window should be secured by means of fastenings which are readily openable from the inside and should be fitted with safety restrictors.  Lockable handles or restrictors, which can only be released by removable keys or other tools, should not be fitted to window opening sections.  While the detailed provisions set out in my Department's best practice guidelines are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations, the use of alternative design solutions, standards, systems or methods of fire protection to those outlined in the technical guidance are acceptable, provided the level of fire safety achieved is adequate to satisfy the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations 1997.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.Under the legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner, rather than the occupier, may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person's occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate, then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year.  However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can support the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.

I intend to announce details of the projects to be included under the CAS programme very shortly. Given that individual approved housing bodies may cater for a range of special housing needs and that the accommodation provided by these bodies may be multi-purpose, it is not possible definitively to state the number of proposals which, in whole or in part, are intended for homeless accommodation. However, of the 205 proposals received some 67 of these provide for some level of homeless accommodation.

The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  The guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in relation to entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  Enquiries in this regard should be directed to the relevant local authority.

Housing maintenance works, including pre-letting repairs, are funded directly by local authorities from their own resources, including from rental income and receipts from the disposal of properties and sales of houses to tenants.Under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock, including   the regeneration of large social housing estates and flat complexes, estate wide remedial works schemes, a retrofitting measure to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses and funding for extensions and adaptations to meet the needs of tenants with a disability. Given the constraints on capital budgets for new stock, my Department has in recent years placed a greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement works programmes and on the early return of vacant units to productive use.A total of €18 million is being provided this year for improving the quality and energy efficiency of older housing stock. Beginning in 2011, my Department required local authorities to focus the energy retrofitting programme on bringing vacant stock back into productive use. The 2012 programme will build on the achievements of 2011 when more than 2,600 vacant units were refurbished and made available for re-letting. While local authorities may undertake work on tenanted properties, there is a continuing focus on making vacant properties available for re-letting as quickly as possible. Grants of up to €15,000 per house are generally available for improving the fabric of the house with a further grant of up to €3,000 where additional essential works are needed. Over the course of 2010 and 2011 a total of 4,492 houses were improved.In March, I allocated over €6.6 million to Cork County Council under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme. This included an allocation of €873,340 in respect of works to improve the standard and energy efficiency of older housing stock.

That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes will be informed by the review.The claw-back provision is intended to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes.   However, where a person is selling and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result  .

I am currently reviewing the report's content and recommendations.  I appreciate that homeowners dealing with pyrite problems are particularly anxious to see this report published and I intend to publish it as quickly as possible.In the first instance purchasers of new dwellings who encounter structural problems should submit a claim to the guarantee company that has provided structural defect insurance for the dwelling.The conveyancing of property is a matter between a purchaser, vendor, mortgage provider and their respective legal representatives.  There is a responsibility on the parties involved to ensure that due diligence is carried out before the conveyancing of a property is completed.

In March 2011, Fingal County Council appointed Consultants to prepare a Preliminary Report and Environmental Impact Assessment for the contract.  The identification of potential locations for the regional wastewater treatment plant is an important step in this process.In October 2011, as part of the Alternative Sites Assessment and Route Selection Report (Phase 1), Fingal County Council identified nine potential land parcels in the northern part of the Greater Dublin Area within which a proposed regional wastewater treatment plant could potentially be located, along with a marine outfall and an orbital drainage system.  The Council carried out an 8 week non-statutory public consultation seeking views on the proposals and the land parcels.These nine land parcels were then assessed as potential locations in which to site the regional wastewater treatment plant.  The routes for the orbital drainage system and the marine outfall pipe locations were also assessed.  Site specific information, more in-depth desk-top research, consultations and detailed site surveys, as well as feedback from the public were used to assist in identifying the locations with the least impact under 15 criteria.Of these nine land parcels, three sites have now been identified by the Council as emerging preferred site options in the Alternative Sites Assessment and Route Selection Report (Phase 2).  A new 8 week non-statutory public consultation period commenced on Monday, 14 May 2012, and runs until 6 July 2012.  As part of this process, 4 Open Days are being arranged by the Council where the public can meet with the Project Team and discuss the Report.When the preferred site is identified the Council will prepare detailed plans and complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This EIS together with a planning application under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006 will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála will carry out its own statutory public consultation on the project.My main role in water services projects is to provide capital funding for the work through my Department's water services investment programme and I may, in the future, have a statutory role should there be a requirement for a foreshore licence for the project.  Beyond the inclusion of the project in the investment programme for planning, and funding of the planning stage, I have not commented on these proposals as they developed, as this might prejudice my statutory role and/or the role of An Bord Pleanála.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to advance the planning of the project.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	706	My Department's overall goal is to support sustainable development which requires us to address a range of issues across its three pillars i.e. the environmental, economic and the social. Our Sustainable Future — A Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland which was published in June 2012, provides a framework for the integration of sustainable development considerations across all sectors of society. It will also provide a platform for the advancement of the green economy in Ireland over the medium to longer term.   Key areas covered in the Framework include sustainable consumption and production; conservation and management of natural resources; climate change and clean energy; sustainable agriculture; sustainable transport; social inclusion, sustainable communities and spatial planning; education, communication and behaviour change.  Our Sustainable Future   sets out 70 clear measures in regard to these policy areas along with associated responsibilities and timelines that will ensure we improve our quality of life for current and future generations.   It will be a matter for individual sectors led by the relevant Departments to promote and co-ordinate delivery of measures in Our Sustainable Future   in their respective areas. I will also chair a High-Level Inter-Departmental Group on Sustainable Development (HLGSD) which will coordinate and drive overall implementation.  The HLGSD will report on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by the Taoiseach. Our Sustainable Future and a summary of the document are available in electronic format in the Oireachtas library or can be downloaded from the Department’s website at www.environ.ie.Key areas of activity for my Department in supporting environmental protection include the provision of €32 million in funding in 2012, largely to meet the cost of the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. In addition, the Environment Fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, will allow a further €79 million to be directed to key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention, landfill remediation and recycling.€331 million is being allocated in 2012 to support implementation of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013.  This is required to expand infrastructural capacity and upgrade the water supply distribution network to tackle leakage.  Some €40 million has been allocated to the Rural Water Programme this year, primarily to address drinking water quality issues in the group water sector and in smaller public schemes.The Rural Development Programme also plays a significant role in addressing employment and quality of life issues in rural Ireland and some €97m is available through the LEADER programme in 2012.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Galway.  The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €130 million in the country during the period of the Programme.   However, the Clarinbridge Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.   Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013   was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Clarinbridge Sewerage Scheme was received from Galway County Council in response to the review.

A decision on the matter will not be possible until inspections are underway and the extent of the problems and costs of remediation are clearer. In any case, any financial support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of the individual households concerned.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property in a county council or urban area is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for payment of rates. However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes. These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.A small number of urban local authorities have historically had separate legal provision enabling a refund of 50% of rates on vacant properties. While the same criteria for refunds apply, 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of vacant premises in these cities. These legislative provisions are section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930; section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934; and section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941. The majority of local authorities are, however, subject to the provisions of the 1946 Act. Any proposal to alter the existing rebate system would require legislative amendment on a nationwide basis.I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to rates under regular review. I have no immediate plans to amend legislation in relation to commercial rates and, in particular, to the question of refunds in respect of vacant premises.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta (MFG), the group contracted by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) to deliver Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) in Gaeltacht Areas, went into liquidation on 7 September 2011 leaving Gaeltacht areas temporarily without access to the programme. Progress in the context of the legal "winding up" of MFG is ongoing and in this context the final figures with regard to number of payments due are not yet fully clarified. My Department is aware of the level of funding committed at various different stages of project life cycles but a series of administrative and financial checks will have to be carried out before payment numbers and amounts can be finalised. There have been no investigations with regard to the delivery of LEADER funding in Gaeltacht areas.The process of identifying those promoters whose projects are at an advanced stage of development has been largely established and a system, in cooperation with Local Development Companies contiguous to Gaeltacht areas, is in place to facilitate the final checking and processing of payment claims in respect of these projects in the short term. Many of these files have now been sent to the relevant Local Development Companies (LDCs) who will be in touch directly with the relevant promoter to arrange payment.In the context of the delivery of the Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) elements of the RDP in Gaeltacht areas in the longer term, my Department has been working with geographically contiguous LDCs to determine the optimum long term solutions to facilitate the continuation of the service previously provided by MFG in Gaeltacht areas. Following the completion of an open and inclusive process, a long term delivery solution for the remainder of the current programme has been agreed for the Gaeltacht areas of Counties Galway, Donegal, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Meath. The Department is currently in the process of formalising arrangements with the relevant Local Development Companies. There is a system in place to address the current outstanding commitments in Co Mayo in general, and the future delivery for the Gaeltacht areas of South West Mayo in particular; however, some further work is required to finalise a solution for the future delivery in the remaining areas of Co Mayo. I expect that a solution in respect of that final area will be reached very shortly.

I understand that a report is in the final stages of completion and that it will be furnished to me shortly.  Pending its receipt, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.I understand that €447,000 has been paid to various projects through MNELP to date in 2012, and currently there are 16 applicants for payment awaiting final processing.

That labour market assessment would ultimately be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.   In this regard it should be borne in mind that the technology sector spans a broad range of skills with differing levels of supply and demand.I would also envisage that applicants for any such programmes would be subject to a rigorous assessment of their qualifications and experience to ensure that their skill sets are appropriate for the sector in question.In any event, the existing visa application arrangements are entirely flexible and designed to cater for the widest possible range of applicants who may wish to come here as workers, visitors, professionals and so forth.

Subject to the above Act, the Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.The matters raised by the Deputy in the question are operational matters for the Authority and I do not have direct responsibility in this regard. However, I am forwarding the details of the question to the Authority and I will ask them to respond directly to the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	714	The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 repeals the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973 and establishes the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) to licence and regulate Property Services Providers (i.e. Auctioneer/Estate Agent, Letting Agent or Management Agent). The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions and I cannot comment on the specifics of any individual case.  In order to be licensed as a Property Services Provider by the Authority a person must have either a "minimum academic qualification" or "a minimum level of experience", as set down in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Qualifications) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 181 of 2012).In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, it would appear that the person concerned wishes to clarify if  his past experience in the provision of property services is sufficient to meet the experience requirement.  The Regulations require, inter alia, a minimum level of experience, i.e. that the applicant has lawfully engaged in the provision of the property service for which he or she is seeking the licence for not less than 3 years of the 5 year period immediately preceding the making of the application. Alternatively, the Regulations provide that the Authority may grant a licence where it is satisfied that the applicant has such other qualifications or experience, or both, which satisfy the Authority that the applicant is suitable to provide the property service for which he or she is seeking the licence.

Records show that to date, the person concerned has not attended their local immigration office.As the person referred to by the Deputy has no current permission to remain in the State, she should now make an application to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, General Immigration Division, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 for an extension of permission to remain.  It is open to the person concerned to seek permission to remain as a student or as a dependant of their mother.If seeking permission to remain as a student the following documentation is required:1.

Of the 78 alleged victims of human trafficking, 61 were female and 17 were male, 59 were adults and 19 were minors (i.e. persons under the age of 18 years).In 2010, Nigeria was the country of origin of 26 of the alleged victims, 11 were from Romania, 6 from Ireland, and 5 were from Bangladesh. There were 3 alleged victims from each of China, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. There were 2 alleged victims from each of Albania, Cameroon, Lithuania, Morocco, Poland and South Africa. The following countries were the countries of origin of 1 alleged victim each: Bulgaria, Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Latvia, Malaysia, Philippines, Ukraine and Togo.In 2010, five persons were convicted of offences relating to trafficking of human beings. Two persons were convicted under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. One person was convicted under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 and two persons were convicted under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.In 2011, 53 cases of alleged trafficking in human beings involving 57 alleged victims were reported to An Garda Síochána. Of the 57, 48 were female and 9 were male, 44 were adults and 13 were minors.In 2011, Nigeria was the country of origin of 19 alleged victims. There were 6 alleged victims from each of Ireland and Romania and 4 were from Pakistan. There were 2 alleged victims from each of Albania, Brazil, Morocco, South Africa and Thailand.

One person was convicted under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. Two persons were convicted under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and one person was convicted under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.More detailed statistical information on the nature and extent of human trafficking in Ireland and information on prosecutions and convictions are in the Annual Reports on Trafficking In Human Beings in Ireland for 2011, 2010 and 2009 which are available at www.blueblindfold.gov.ie/What is Being Done?/Data Strategy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I wish to advise the Deputy that the costs of providing services through Irish are met from my Department's Administrative Budget and cannot readily be distinguished from the cost of providing services generally.  Accordingly the information sought by the Deputy could not be compiled without the application of a disproportionate amount of staff-time and resources.I can also inform the Deputy that while my Department does engage outside translators on occasion, as much translation work as possible is undertaken by an in-house translator and other staff members who are proficient in Irish.  Examples of documents translated by Departmental staff include Rules of Court, Statutory Instruments, forms, website pages, correspondence, etc.I can further inform the Deputy that, in common with other categories of expenditure, my Department seeks to provide Irish language services with an eye to securing value for money. To illustrate this, the Deputy may wish to note that since February 2003 my Department has been involved in a major on-going Irish language project, the translation of the Rules of Court. To facilitate the efficient and effective completion of this project my Department has employed an in-house translator principally to oversee and carry out the translations of these Rules. The Irish translations of the District Court Rules, 1997 and the Circuit Court Rules, 2001 have been published and work is on-going in relation to the preparation for publication of the translation of Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986. By engaging an in-house translator for this purpose my Department estimates that it has made significant savings on this project.I would also like to point out that translation costs incurred are but one part of the total cost to my Department of providing services through Irish. Costs, other than translation costs, are incurred when replies are prepared to Parliamentary Questions and letters, speaking and briefing material is prepared for Dáil and Seanad debates, advertisements are drafted and the array of documents which originate from my Department are drafted — for example, strategy statements, annual reports, language schemes, forms, Statutory Instruments and web pages. Details of all these inputs and their associated costs are not recorded separately by my Department. Consequently, the costs of providing services through Irish cannot readily be distinguished from the cost of providing services generally.

This action was carried out in accordance with section 27 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, which allows a judge to transfer any business of the District Court in which he/she has jurisdiction to another venue in his district.   I am informed that this provision was applied in this case in the absence of a suitable premises in Castletownbere.  As both Castletownbere and Bantry are located in the same District (No. 18), no Statutory Instrument was required to give effect to such a temporary move which was a matter for the District judge.Due to economic conditions, the Courts Service was not in a position to provide a premises or facilities of an appropriate standard in Castletownbere and the Courts Service Board subsequently decided to amalgamate (which is a different process from the transfer referred to above) the District Court area of Castletownbere into the District Court area of Bantry.  This decision was carried out under section 26 of the 1953 Act, as amended, and brought into effect as necessary by Statutory Instrument No. 669 of 2011.

Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The background to the protest is well known and the legal position with respect to continued turf cutting on protected bogs is unambiguous.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the services of the Emergency Response Unit or the Special Detective Unit were not utilised during the incidents referred to. Personnel from the Western Regional Support Unit, in unarmed mode, supplemented Garda personnel deployed to this incident but were not utilised and continued to conduct regular patrols within the Garda Division.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána continues to work closely with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, at both a national and local level, to ensure compliance with the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.Policing strategies are, of course, a matter for An Garda Síochána and while I, as Minister, have no direct role in such matters, I have every confidence that the Gardaí continue to carry out their duties in a fully professional manner. The Gardaí have my full and unequivocal support in their efforts to uphold the law.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 504 and 505 together.The coroner is an independent officer charged with the investigation of certain reportable deaths. The primary public expression of that investigation is the inquest which seeks factually to discover the circumstances of the person's death. It provides  accessibility to the deceased's family and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny.  In a case such as the Deputy mentions as potentially arising, I am satisfied that the inquest meets the State's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, and in particular Article 2 of the Convention.   I would also mention in this regard, the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005, which ended the  restriction on the coroner from summoning more than 2 medical witnesses to give evidence at an inquest, increased sanctions on witnesses and jurors who failed to attend or cooperate at an inquest and  increased powers of compellability for the coroner in regard to the attendance of witnesses and jurors at an inquest.The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service.The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003. It also has regard to developments since in terms of jurisprudence both in our own courts and the European Court of Human Rights and to ongoing reform of coroner services in other common law jurisdictions.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for some early reforms in coronial matters.

The Board's functions are set out in section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Where a judicial vacancy arises, the Board submits to the Minister for Justice and Equality the names of all persons who have notified to the Board their wish to be considered for appointment to that vacancy and the names of the persons whom it recommends for appointment.  The Government then makes a nomination to the President in accordance with the Constitution.  Section 17 of the 1995 Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government nominates a serving judge for appointment.Since March 2011, the following persons have been nominated by the Government for appointment by the President.NamePositionSusan Denham*Chief JusticeFrank Clarke*Judge of the Supreme CourtJohn MacMenamin*Judge of the Supreme CourtMichael White*Judge of the High CourtKevin CrossJudge of the High CourtPaul McDermottJudge of the High CourtIseult O’MalleyJudge of the High CourtColm MacEochaidhJudge of the High CourtRaymond Groarke*President of the Circuit CourtThomas O’Donnell*Judge of the Circuit CourtSarah BerkeleyJudge of the Circuit CourtPauline CoddJudge of the Circuit CourtBarry HicksonJudge of the Circuit CourtKeenan JohnsonJudge of the Circuit CourtMary Ellen RingJudge of the Circuit CourtDavid Riordan*Judge of the Circuit CourtCarmel StewartJudge of the Circuit CourtRosemary Horgan*President of the District Court**Rosemary HorganJudge of the District CourtMichael P.

Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Although a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis had been in preparation for the Bill, because of the prescribed time-frame under the EU-IMF-ECB Programme, it did not prove possible to complete it for issue when the Bill was published. The Deputy will be aware that the relevant Guidelines specifically allow for a Regulatory Impact Analysis to follow a Bill in such exceptional circumstances as applied in this instance. The development of the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is further advanced and will continue against the backdrop of the amendments to the Bill that are being prepared. As I have previously stated, the completed RIA will be made available to Members for timely consideration prior to Committee Stage.  It remains my objective, notwithstanding the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, that Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill should commence as soon as possible after the summer recess.

What will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force. The Government are conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed by the Service that there are 52 circuit court venues sitting in 8 circuits as set out in the table below:CircuitCountyVenuesEasternLouthDundalkMeathTrimKildareNaas, AthyWicklowBrayNorthernCavanCavanMonaghanMonaghan, CarrickmacrossLeitrimCarrick-on-Shannon, ManorhamiltonDonegalLetterkenny, Donegal, BuncranaWesternGalwayGalway, Loughrea, ClifdenMayoCastlebar, Ballina, Westport, SwinfordSouth-WesternClareEnnis, KilrushLimerickLimerick, NewcastlewestKerryTralee, Killarney, ListowelSouth-EasternWaterfordWaterford, DungarvanWexfordWexfordTipperaryClonmel, Nenagh, ThurlesKilkennyKilkennyCarlowCarlowMidlandLaoisPortlaoiseOffalyTullamoreWestmeathMullingar, AthloneLongfordLongfordRoscommonRoscommonSligoSligoCorkCorkCork, Bandon, Bantry, Clonakilty, Fermoy, Mallow, Midleton, Skibberreen, YoughalDublinDublinDublin** Dublin is regarded as one circuit court venue although the court may sit in a number of venues. The Courts Service has informed me that it is currently in the process of a comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country and no court venue or office is excluded from this process.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect to ensure continuity of service with reduced budgets and resources.  Greater flexibility in the deployment of available resources will be critical in maintaining the delivery of front line court services.  The Service has indicated that its policy in considering the future operational viability of any venue is to consult with local stakeholders, however, the decision in relation to the closure of a venue is a matter for the Courts Service Board.In addition, under Section 10 of the Courts Of Justice Act 1947, it is a matter for the President of the Circuit Court to determine where the Circuit Court shall sit within each circuit.

It is presently intended to make provision to house the museum collection in a suitable location in Custume Bks, Athlone, where the 4th Field Artillery Regiment is now located.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	759	Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is ongoing but limited due to resource constraints. The current budgetary provision provides for approximately 30,000 paid training man-days. In 2011 and 2012, I sanctioned paid training man-days to include support for the training of new recruits to the RDF. This was sufficient to train approximately 400 recruits during 2011 and 2012. The military authorities manage recruitment in this context. The numbers actually enlisted in any one year may not reflect the numbers of recruits trained in that year. In 2011 there were a total of 267 reservists enlisted and up to the end of May 2012 there have been a total of 85 enlistments to the RDF.   In October 2011 I agreed to sanction limited promotions within the RDF to bring the current strength in all ranks to 70% of the established strength in each rank as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4. In the case of promotions from Private to Corporal, the sanction provided that promotions could be made which brought strength to 60% of the established strength as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4. I also indicated that any ranks where the strength was at or above 70% (or 60% in the case of Corporal Rank) would not be considered for promotion. In considering the issue of promotions for the RDF I was mindful of the fact that a Value for Money Review of the Reserve is ongoing. Additionally I had to have regard to the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which was underway at the time and which placed a requirement on Government Departments to identify opportunities for savings across all aspects of business. The position agreed by me in October last remains in place.

The Civil Defence Act 2002 provides that the Board shall consist of at least eight but not more than fourteen members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence. Legislation is currently being drafted to dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions of the Board back into the Department of Defence. I appointed the current Board as an interim measure from 2011.

The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I have since appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.All appointments to Boards under the aegis of my Department are in accordance with the relevant legislation or regulations.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	761	My Department's overall goal is to support sustainable development which requires us to address a range of issues across its three pillars i.e. the environmental, economic and the social. Our Sustainable Future — A Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland which was published in June 2012, provides a framework for the integration of sustainable development considerations across all sectors of society. It will also provide a platform for the advancement of the green economy in Ireland over the medium to longer term.  Key areas covered in the Framework include sustainable consumption and production; conservation and management of natural resources; climate change and clean energy; sustainable agriculture; sustainable transport; social inclusion, sustainable communities and spatial planning; education, communication and behaviour change. Our Sustainable Future sets out 70 clear measures in regard to these policy areas along with associated responsibilities and timelines that will ensure we improve our quality of life for current and future generations.It will be a matter for individual sectors led by the relevant Departments to promote and co-ordinate delivery of measures in Our Sustainable Future in their respective areas. I will also chair a High-Level Inter-Departmental Group on Sustainable Development (HLGSD) which will coordinate and drive overall implementation.  The HLGSD will report on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by the Taoiseach.Our Sustainable Future and a summary of the document are available in electronic format in the Oireachtas library or can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.environ.ie.Key areas of activity for my Department in supporting environmental protection include the provision of €32 million in funding in 2012, largely to meet the cost of the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. In addition, the Environment Fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, will allow a further €79 million to be directed to key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention, landfill remediation and recycling.€331 million is being allocated in 2012 to support implementation of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013.  This is required to expand infrastructural capacity and upgrade the water supply distribution network to tackle leakage.  Some €40 million has been allocated to the Rural Water Programme this year, primarily to address drinking water quality issues in the group water sector and in smaller public schemes.The Rural Development Programme also plays a significant role in addressing employment and quality of life issues in rural Ireland and some €97m is available through the LEADER programme in 2012.

During this administrative checking process it was discovered that the parcels listed on Form N were not designated areas.  My Department subsequently rejected the application as the scheme Terms and Conditions had not been complied with. A letter issued to the person named on 18 April 2012 setting out this decision and providing the option to submit an appeal. An appeal was received in writing on 26th April 2012, however the original decision was upheld. The person named submitted an appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office on 18 May 2012 and officials are currently reviewing the file.  The person named will be notified of the result in due course.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	764	In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries, the Celtic Sea stock, the stocks off the North West coast and the Atlanto Scandian stock. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding-Management Plan for the fishery.  A modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa South.The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.

The person named was selected for a ground inspection which took place on 13 May 2011. During this inspection, areas of non-compliance with the terms and condition of the scheme were noted in relation to the Species Rich Grassland Option which resulted in a penalty being imposed. A letter issued to the person named on 23 November 2011 informing him of this penalty and giving him the option to appeal the decision. To date, no appeal has been received in the Department. The penalty amount of €25.12 will be deducted from the balancing 25% payment which will issue shortly.Payments in respect of the 2011 scheme year are subject to a similar administrative checking process. Following the payment of year 1, the administrative checking process in respect of year 2 will be completed.

The objective of this measure is to contribute to halting biodiversity. An applicant receives payment of €314 per hectare per calendar year for each year of the 5 year AEOS contract for undertaking this measure. All 2011 AEOS applicants were aware of the terms and conditions and specifications of the scheme prior to entering the scheme.The 2011 AEOS introduced a number of amendments to the 2010 scheme, including changes to the traditional hay meadows measure. In that case, the cutting date was changed from 1 July to the 15 July to ensure a greater impact on improving biodiversity.  The management of traditional hay meadows allows a maximum application of 30kgs of fertiliser per hectare which would not give an excessive crop requiring early cutting. With ground trafficability currently difficult due to the recent weather conditions, my view is that to allow the cutting of hay after July 1 would be of no advantage to the scheme participants.

However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who did not meet these requirements, where a lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS). All applicants will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The 2008 CAP ‘Health Check' review agreed to the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, and provided for a smooth transition by increasing quota for all Member States in the remaining years.  Under those arrangements Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014.  However for some countries, including Ireland, these quota increases are insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics, and the prospect of a quota free production environment after 2015.I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bilateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and in that context we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition to quota abolition in all countries.   To date, however, the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission's view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The Deputy will be aware that the issue of beef access for Irish beef on the US market is a priority for me.I welcomed the publication in March by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) of their draft BSE Rule, which essentially proposes to align US BSE rules with those of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the internationally-recognised forum for developing and setting guidelines and standards relating to animal health and trade in animal products. This would mean that the US would base its beef import policy for a particular country on that country's BSE risk classification as determined by the OIE's risk evaluation. At present, Ireland, like most other EU member states has the same ‘controlled risk' status for BSE as the USA and Canada. This is an important first step in a process which should allow for the resumption in Irish and EU beef exports to the US.  The publication of the draft BSE rule on 16 March marked the start of a public consultation period that was originally scheduled to end on 15 May, but was extended to 14 June due to the level of interest shown in the rule.  I met with US Agriculture Secretary Mr. Tom Vilsack on Tuesday last, 26 June, during which I raised the subject of access to the US market for Irish beef.  I explained the importance to the Irish government of progress on this issue, asked that the US finalise the rule as soon as possible.Secretary Vilsack was broadly supportive of the use of OIE categorisation as a basis for regulating international trade in beef, and explained that it was critically important from the point of view of ensuring that a finalised BSE rule was legally robust, to adhere strictly to the consultation and other procedural requirements. In that context, his Department would be required to give proper consideration to all of submissions made during the public consultation.Against this background, I believe that once the procedural requirements around the publication of the BSE rule are completed, the US will move to lift the ban on the export of EU beef to the US market.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Under the Child Care Act, 1991(as amended) the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. In such circumstances the HSE may apply to the Court for a care order. A care order commits a child to the care of the HSE and the HSE has control over the child as if it was his/her parent and  takes reasonable steps to safeguard and promote the child's health, development or welfare. The HSE decides on the type of care to be provided and the majority of children are placed in foster care.In placing a child in foster care, the HSE regards the welfare the child as paramount, having regard to the rights and duties of his/her parents.  Each child in foster care has a social worker who visits the child in the foster carers' home and maintains a link with the child's birth family. Every foster carer also has a social worker, known as a link worker, to support and supervise them.    The link workers responsibilities include ensuring that foster carers receive all relevant information and advice about the children including background history, health and education.  The link worker organises training, provides regular supervision and support for foster carers and their children and ensures that foster carers understand, accept and operate within relevant standards, policies and guidance of the HSE.  The link worker also provides foster carers with specific written information on and explanations of HSE procedures should a complaint or allegation be made against them and the supports available in such an event.  Support is also available from Public Health Nurses, psychologists and child care workers as appropriate with other professionals being accessed if necessary, for example, speech therapists, counselling services etc. Any concerns that a foster carer has about a child's welfare may be addressed to the appropriate person from the support network available to them.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I presume the Deputy's question relates to separated children seeking asylum who go missing while in the care of the state. In this regard, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised me that thirteen separated children seeking asylum were reported missing from care in 2010. Eight of these young people returned to care, while five young adults who are aged between 18 and 21 years  are still missing.  Three of the young people reported missing were from Nigeria, two each from Somalia, Afghanistan and South Africa and the others were from China, Brazil, Algeria and Albania.During 2011, 6 young people were reported missing, all of whom are still missing. Three are aged seventeen, one is eighteen and two are nineteen years. Two of these young people were from China, the others were from Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria and Bangladesh.The HSE and the Garda National Immigrant Bureau have a Joint National Protocol on Children who go missing from care and have held meetings  between their respective management to identify risk, share information and work cooperatively in respect to this group of children. The parties to the meetings include Local Garda Inspectors, GMIB Inspectors, Social Workers engaged in after hours and separated children seeking asylum teams.The steps taken to address risk issues in relation to separated children include collaborative interviewing at points of entry between the Garda and social workers and planned surveillance of those at risk of going missing from the point of entry to the initial period in placement and a range of other activities undertaken by An Garda Síochána. The HSE and An Garda Síochána continue to intensify joint efforts to prevent  separated children going missing from care and to respond jointly where this does occur. The revised Children First   National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  It emphasises the need to safeguard and  to protect children, particularly vulnerable children.  It specifically highlights the roles and responsibilities of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, as the two agencies with statutory responsibility for child protection and forms an integral part of their existing operations and practice. Where the HSE has identified a concern regarding child trafficking, this is referred to the Garda and the two statutory organisations work closely together to ensure the safety of the child. HSE management and staff have been closely involved in collaboration with the Department of Justice and Equality in the development of the National Action Plan on Anti-Human Trafficking and every effort is being made to fulfil the commitment to combat trafficking as outlined in this Plan.

Key services provided by FRCs include:Information, advice and support for groups and families at local level.Assistance to community groups (such as training and the shared use of facilities).Education courses and training opportunities.Childcare facilities for those attending courses provided by the FRC.After-school clubs.A key role for FRCs is in providing information and advice. In 2010, over 136,000 people were advised directly by an FRC and a further 56,000 people were referred onwards to other information providers.  The VEC's and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) were the services to which people were most frequently referred.FRCs have a broad range of involvement with children and young people and work closely with many local schools.  The range of interventions include early childhood care and education, initiatives to retain children and young people in school, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, youth cafés, community based youth work, facilities and services for young people, work with particular target groups of vulnerable young people and work on issues of particular concern/risk to young people e.g. alcohol and drugs prevention, etc.The Agency also provides funding to voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services.  Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 20,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within FRCs in 2010.The pressures exerted by a range of issues — financial, interpersonal, behavioural, etc. — can have a negative influence on the family unit, and in turn impact on the health and/or welfare of a child or children.  Children in such circumstances must be protected. In this context the  has a duty under the Child Care Act, 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive the appropriate level of care.Parents can and do seek the assistance of the HSE.  Through direct provision or through its funding of a variety of family support and related community/voluntary providers the HSE works to support families.  The HSE also receives children into care on a voluntary basis where parents indicate they need this support on a temporary or short-term basis because of their inability to cope.  At all times the HSE seeks to support families in accessing all of the services and benefits to which they are entitled to meet the needs of their children.  Only where there is a risk to the protection or welfare of a child does the HSE seek to take the child into care under a care order.Looking to the future, the Family Support Agency will, along with the HSE's Children and Family Services, form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency, due to be established in 2013.  Plans for the transition to this new entity are well under way.  I believe this will provide for greater integration of these complementary services, with their shared aims of supporting parents and families and ensuring the welfare and protection of children are adequately safeguarded.

I have invited the Vietnamese Minister for Justice, Mr. Ha Hung Cuong, to visit in September and I expect that the agreement setting out the administrative arrangements will be signed during his visit.  During their visit, the Vietnamese delegation visited with the bodies accredited by the Adoption Authority to facilitate adoptions from Vietnam, ARC and Helping Hands. I am hopeful that the discussions the delegation held with these accredited bodies will greatly assist future interactions.  Details in relation to timeframes and processes for adoptions from Vietnam should become clearer following the finalisation of the administrative arrangements by the two Central Authorities.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	796	The total funding available under the programme was €6 million and following an appraisal process  290 applications were approved for funding.  All programme funding is considered in the context of the annual estimates and budgetary process and it is not possible to advise the Deputy in advance of these discussions in relation to programmes to be funded in 2013.My Department currently administers three childcare support programmes — the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Because of the current budgetary situation, new applications from community service providers to entry the programme in 2012 are only being considered in exceptional circumstances.The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010.  The CETS programme provides free childcare places in both community and commercial services to qualifying FÁS and Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) trainees and students.  Again, due to the budgetary situation, no approvals for new childcare places are currently being considered under this programme. In the region of €63 million is being provided in 2012 to support the CCS and CETS programmes.The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme provides one free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Both community and commercial childcare services are eligible to apply to participate in this programme.  The cost of the programme is expected to be approximately €176 million in 2012, an increase of almost €10 million on the previous year.   The ECCE programme will continue to be evaluated and developed as resources permit. The local City and County Childcare Committees will advise childcare providers in relation to participation in these programmes and further information is available on the Department website.  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.In relation to the NEWB there have been 7 appointments to the Board since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The names of the Board members appointed are Brendan Broderick, Catherine Connery, Marian Jennings, Ruairí Gogan, Eamonn Flynn, Bob Dowling and Mary Donnelly.In relation to the FSA there have been 11 Board Members appointed namely Sharon Foley (Chair), Dick Hickey, Catherine Hazlett, (resigned 16th May, 2012)  Marie Fenlon, Yvette O'Malley (resigned 10th November, 2011), Liz Chaloner,  Nuala Ryan, Imelda Martin, Caroline Murphy, Dr. Nollaig Byrne and Dr. John Griffin.  For the Board of the AAI I have made one appointment which was Imelda Ryan.In relation to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management there has been eleven appointments, Joe Horan (Chair), Gerard McKiernan, Ursula Kilkenny, Diego Gallagher, Sylda Langford, Pat Rooney, Elizabeth Howard, Colin Fetherston, Barry Rooney, Deirdre Keyes and Dan Kelleher.

To inform the process, my Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth development and support and this will be available shortly.  The findings from this review will be explored by practitioners and managers of young people's services, academics, researchers and others at a symposium on Youth Development Outcomes planned for later this month.Two working groups — an International Expert Reference Group and a National Youth Work Advisory Committee Task Group — are assisting my Department in developing the Youth Policy Framework.  The International Expert Reference Group has met on three occasions.  The Task Group has met once and both groups have met together jointly on one occasion to coordinate expert and stakeholder input into the draft findings of the international review.The Deputy will be aware that the foundation for the Youth Policy Framework is in the Children's and Young People's Policy Framework.  A public consultation on this Framework is underway at present.  It is anticipated that the Children's and Young People's Policy Framework will be available in 2012.  It is my intention that the Youth Policy Framework will be completed in the light of the Children's and Young People's Policy Framework and in particular in the light of the public consultation underway at present as well as the expert and youth services providers' input.  I am also keen to ensure that youth policy developments at European level during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers in 2013 will inform Ireland's national policy for young people.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health and its sub-committees have broad representation from areas such as dentistry, biochemistry, environmental health and public health medicine.  The Expert Body also has a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests.  The sub-committees of the Expert Body may also co-opt members as the need arises.  Of the Expert Body's 17 members, 5 are members of the dental profession.  These include a former Chief Dental Officer in my Department, two senior academics (one of whom is also a former Chief Dental Officer and one of whom is Chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Dental Health Foundation) and two from the public health service, one of whom is Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Dental Health Foundation.  They have extensive experience in areas of public health, epidemiology, statistics, fluorides and health promotion.  The Dental Health Foundation, a charitable trust supported by my Department and the HSE, does not have members.In evaluating ongoing research on all aspects of fluoridation, the Expert Body accepts the fundamental scientific tenet that any single piece of scientific evidence by itself remains hypothetical unless it can be repeated or confirmed by other scientists.  Therefore, it considers scientific evidence that has been submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised peer reviewed scientific journals, after such publication has been approved by independent referees.  This ensures that the advice provided by the Expert Body is impartial and evidence-based.

It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 micrograms and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland. The product is manufactured in the United Kingdom.  A shortage of Eltroxin emerged in February 2012 when the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency suspended the authorisation of an alternative levothyroxine 100 microgram tablet product.  As a result, the overall supply of levothyroxine on the Irish and UK markets was reduced.The Health Service Executive (HSE) and the IMB have been managing the situation and issued a joint communication (26th April 2012) via the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) updating pharmacists on management of the shortage. The HSE put in place special arrangements to reimburse suitable UK licensed product stock and this was notified to community pharmacists on 1st May 2012. The HSE have advised that 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms Eltroxin were released onto the Irish market in mid-June.  However, where that has not been sufficient to address immediate patient need, pharmacists have dispensed unlicensed levothyroxine, which is more expensive than Eltroxin.

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than €132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

Neither the HSE nor my Department has a role in the decision by a company as to whether it makes such an application to the HSE.In order for a medicinal product to be considered by the HSE for reimbursement it must meet specified criteria. These include the following:The product must be an ‘allopathic' medicinal product authorised by the Irish Medicines Board or the European Commission.The product must be such that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription.The product should not be advertised or promoted to the public.Should the manufacturers of the products referred to by the Deputy submit an application for reimbursement it will be considered in the context of the above criteria.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 and 627 together.  Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.   The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:Health-funded rehabilitative training;Health-funded day services;FÁS-funded vocational training;Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.The demand for day services, including rehabilitative training, for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 650 school-leavers will require services in 2012. This year, disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers from within their existing budgets. In previous years demographic funding was provided to meet this need. 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to additional challenges in service provision.The HSE is currently working with all relevant service providers to maximize the use of the available places. Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals who require day and rehabilitative training places can be responded to within available resources.The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  There are already many excellent examples of collaborative working between providers and the HSE in innovatively responding to the needs of individuals. The HSE and disability service providers have agreed that families will be notified by the 10th   July if a place is available or if the individual is to be placed on a waiting list.  Some funding will be made available through Genio, a non-profit organisation established to support innovative projects that foster social inclusion. The outcome of applications to Genio for funding of initiatives pertaining to school leavers will be made known in the coming weeks.The HSE and the disability service providers acknowledge that the waiting period is a difficult time for individuals and their families. Every effort is being made to achieve an equitable and sustainable outcome.

As the Deputy will be aware, this new marketing variation sought by Allergan will enable that company to replace the existing animal based test method with a non-animal method. I welcome this development.The Deputy also asks if and when Allergan's authorities to carry out animal-based LD50 assays for testing botulinum neurotoxins were amended and withdrawn following confirmation that the non-animal test represented an alternative to the LD50 assays. In this regard, I should point out that the company involved is not a establishment registered under the existing legislation for the performance of scientific experiments on animals. I have no doubt, however, that Allergan will look to have this new non-animal test method with regard to botox testing widely used given the considerable investment involved in the development of the test.A reduction of LD50 animal testing assay should initially become evident on the publication of the 2012 statistics. It should be noted that as the new non-animal cell based test method is not available to other companies, the issue of withdrawing current licences involving LD50 tests does not arise.   On the matter as to whether Allergan could make their non-animal botulinum neurotoxin test available to companies who continue to perform the animal-based test in Ireland, the IMB has advised my Department that the data submitted by the applicant is confidential and that, if another company proposed a similar change, it would need to submit its own variation application with supporting documentation. It is open to companies in this area to approach Allergan in this regard but I do not consider that it would appropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to intervene in this matter. We have informed other companies in this area, however, that such a test exists and encouraged them to develop other similar models.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The HSE recognises the importance of home help and home care in supporting older persons to live in their own homes/communities in accordance with Government policy. Home help and home care are delivered by the HSE, ‘Voluntary/Not-for-Profit' and private service providers.Home care packages were introduced in 2006 and are an enhanced form of mainstream home care over and above home help.  They also include elements of nursing, therapies and respite and are designed to assist more dependent people, including those in danger of admission to an Acute Hospital, or to facilitate those needing discharge from an Acute Hospital.  They are an additional service to assist older people to continue to live at home.   The increase in the funding to the private home care companies referred to by the Deputy simply reflects the increase in funding in the sector over the period from 2007 to 2010. The HSE employs almost 9,000 home helps directly, and the terms and conditions of these staff are covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative Trade Unions in 2009. Some issues in this agreement regarding contracts are the subject of hearings in the Labour Court. On 29th   June 2012, the Court gave a ruling which stated: "The parties should enter into meaningful discussions on finalising this new agreement, which should be completed within one month of the date of this Recommendation.  In the event that there are any outstanding issues they may be referred back to the Court for a definitive Recommendation.". The HSE is fully committed to implementing this Labour Court recommendation.The recruitment of home helps by the HSE is subject to overall Government policy on employment and remuneration in the public sector, including the recruitment embargo.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	826	I propose to take Questions Nos. 610 to 613, inclusive, together.The programme for Government gives a commitment to develop a  National Strategy on Dementia by 2013 which will increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and enhance community based services for people living with this condition.  The first stage of the process, which was to assemble the research and evidence to inform the policy, was completed earlier this year.  The findings of the review were published and presented to Minister Reilly.  The report is available at www.doh.ie.   Findings from the report include details on prevalence and projections; the economic and social costs; community based health and social services available and services available in both acute and residential settings.The Department is about to commence a public consultation process which will seek the views of interested parties, to help inform the development of the strategy.  I would particularly like to hear the views of those directly affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, including people who have been diagnosed with one of these conditions, and their families and carers.In relation to the provision of services the Health Service Executive provides a range of services for people with dementia including Primary Care Services, Home Support Services, Day Care, Respite, Housing with Care and Continuing Care Services.  These services are delivered through the HSE's network of local offices, via Public Health Nursing, Day Care Centres and Public and Private Residential Care Facilities and where appropriate, Psychiatry of Old Age teams.  The HSE also funds non-governmental agencies to provide a range of services under section 38 of the Health Act (2004).  In addition a limited number of memory clinics and specialist services are available.It is not possible to state exactly what the volume of community services is as data relating to service provision is not collated in a way that identifies dementia specific services.  It is estimated that 63% of all long-stay residents have dementia (Cahill, O'Shea and Pierce 2012).The families and carers of people with dementia can access a number of services through their primary care team or HSE funded services such as those provided by the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland.  Respite services are the most common request and this is provided in a number of ways i.e. through the provision of a Home Care Package to support respite in a persons own home, or through day respite within dementia specific or generic day care centres. Respite is also provided in residential homes.  In addition carer support groups have been established across the country, details of which can be obtained from local Primary Care Teams.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 and 616 together.I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The work of the SDU has demonstrated that we must change the way we manage frail elderly patients.Therefore my Department has worked with the HSE on a new initiative to provide the frail older person with structured and coordinated care.  The intention is to standardise the care pathway for this vulnerable group and to support them to remain at home for as long as possible (95% of older people reside at home currently).This project represents an opportunity to improve quality of care for older people and their families and realise cost efficiencies across both acute and community care and improve integration as follows:Develop timely rapid access to specialist care when required, ideally in a day hospital.Have a coordinated care pathway to manage unplanned presentations, with no delays in Emergency Departments or Acute Medical Units and immediate access to specialist services if required.Establish coordinated links across the acute and community services.  This is to avoid any unnecessary delays in the discharge process, to ensure that if the patient is assessed as suitable they will have access to rehabilitation and additional supports in the home. Referral and response times will be targeted and measured.Establish clear access to rehabilitation and, if the patient has been assessed as requiring long term care, transfer to a transitional care bed in the interim if necessary.Another aim of the project is the link with community groups and patient advocates.Phase 1 of the project will involve patients in the Dublin area, Louth Meath Hospital Group, Naas Hospital and the corresponding community areas and it will be rolled out nationally shortly.The model of care required has been developed by the clinical programme and the care pathway is clearly defined.  Strong collaboration is critical to the delivery of these plans particularly in the increasingly challenging economic environment.In respect of cost, the amount of funding being allocated to each site will be based on an independent gap analysis currently being finalised.  All of the acute sites and areas will be carrying out re- designation of services and beds to achieve the project objectives.  I am heartened that there is tremendous support from those working in the health system for this project and a keen interest in development of a better pathway for this very vulnerable group of patients.  This is a very important initiative and while it is currently not possible to give a definite number of patients who will benefit from it, it is hoped that a significant number will do so.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	828	Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is achieved through a range of community based services such as mainstream Home Help, Meals-on-Wheels, and Respite or Day Care.  In more complex cases, enhanced Home Care Packages (HCPs) may be provided.  Where it is not possible to maintain a person at home, the policy is to support access to quality long-term residential care.Approximately €300 million is earmarked this year by the HSE to provide home-help and home care packages.  The Executive estimate that 10.7 million home-help hours will be delivered in 2012, benefiting approximately 50,002 people.  The HSE is also to provide home care packages to around 10,870 older people at any one time or 15,768 clients over the course of the year.The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a system of financial support for people who require long-term nursing home care.  Under the Scheme, individuals make a contribution towards the cost of their care and the HSE pays the balance.  The scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.  The total gross budget for long-term residential care in 2012 is €994.7 million. A further 1,037 people had been allocated funding but had not yet taken up a bed.  This could be for a variety of reasons, e.g. the person may be awaiting a bed in a particular nursing home.There is nobody on the placement list waiting for funding under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme at present.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for in-patient or day case surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.Question No. 622 answered with Question No. 617.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	834	Private patients, regardless of their origin or destination hospitals, are normally transported by private ambulance companies, subject to the appropriate level of cover by the health insurer and certification of need by their treating consultant.Where a private ambulance is not available, a patient in those circumstances may be eligible for HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) intermediate care transport, depending on medical need. However, such situations are extremely rare. To date in 2012, an average of 7 patients out of a monthly average of 12,500 have been transported in this manner, on a "last resort" basis.  In this context, the NAS does not issue charges to such patients.

New international, scientific and market developments require that we examine whether, ten years on, the Directive still sufficiently guarantees an appropriate functioning of the internal market while ensuring a high level of health protection.  In 2010 the European Commission completed a public consultation in this regard and invited EU interested parties including citizens, economic operators, and non governmental organisations to comment on possible new measures to improve awareness of the dangers of tobacco use, increase motivation to quit and discourage initiation of smoking, amongst other measures.  I understand that the outcome of the analysis of the consultation process, together with the legislative proposal is to be presented by the Commission later this year.Some of the issues being considered by the Commission in this context  include, ingredients and additives, labelling and packaging, smokeless tobacco and the extension of the product scope, sales arrangements (e.g. tobacco vending  machines) and measures against illicit trade.  In recent discussions with representatives of the European Commission I have indicated my wish that the proposal for a revision of the Directive be published as soon as possible in order for Ireland to significantly progress the proposal during the Irish Presidency in January 2013.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The Bioethics Unit advises on a number of issues across various policy areas in my Department, including the protection of animals for scientific purposes. The Bioethics Unit has engaged with and will continue to engage with officials in my Department who have been assigned the task of transposing Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of such animals. Directive 2010/63/EU will be transposed into Irish law by the end of the year and the improved protections for animals set out in the Directive will take effect from 1 January 2013.It should be noted that many of the provisions set out in Directive 2010/63/EU are Mandatory. The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used). The provisions of the new Directive also strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The Government is committed to fundamental reform of the health system.  This will see the delivery of a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which will ensure equal access to care based on need, not income.The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing.  Detailed consideration must be given to the structures that are needed for delivery of different services and to the critical inter-relationships between services as well as best practice in healthcare reform.  My Department has been examining the experience of health reforms in a range of countries, including the Netherlands and Germany.  Part of this work included organising a seminar in Dublin on universal health insurance which was attended by experts from the World Health Organisation, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Dutch Health Ministry.  My officials also undertook a study visit to the Netherlands in June 2011 to examine the Dutch health insurance model. More recently, my officials undertook a study visit to Germany in order to advance our thinking on the introduction of a prospective case-based Money follows the Patient  system for funding hospitals. This is a key building block in relation to the introduction of universal health insurance.I see it as imperative that we continue to engage with interested parties and gain from the experiences of other countries in this area. This is reflected in the membership of the Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance which includes international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.  It is important to bear in mind that, ultimately, this Government's reform proposals will be designed to meet the needs of the Irish system and to ensure the best outcomes for Irish patients.

This draft report is the first stage of a two-stage process in relation to this research on the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. This first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries. The second stage in the research, which is now underway, is a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.The final report, which will take full account of the consultation outcomes and include recommendations, will be presented to me to assist me in my consideration of any actions that may be required to address the issues concerned.  The researcher expects to complete the final report in the Autumn. I then intend to publish the report after it is presented to me, subject to the usual legal considerations but I do not anticipate any significant difficulties in that regard.I do not wish to express any views on the draft report which is going to consultation to preserve the independence of the research process and to allow the women in particular to provide their views in the consultation concentrating solely on the research report and without being possibly deflected from that process by any statements from me.  I would encourage all involved to take the opportunity to participate in the consultation process to ensure that the women concerned can give their views directly to Professor Oonagh Walsh.  I remain determined to bring this matter to a conclusion for all women concerned as soon as possible.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	857	I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of the receipt of the required patient details and letter of confirmation of condition from a doctor or consultant.  Emergency medical cards are generally requested through the manager in a Local Health Office or through a social worker.As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	859	Ireland's public health policy objective in relation to smoking is to promote and subsequently move towards a tobacco free society.  I am committed to moving us closer towards that objective.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG) is examining a number of areas which need to be developed or enhanced in order to reduce smoking prevalence in Ireland such as the possible extension of tobacco control legislation in particular for situations where children are present.  It will also consider social marketing and educational programmes as well as smoking cessation services.I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and that this will be brought to Government for decision.

This period of continued eligibility is further extended if the person appeals the non-renewal of a card or the granting of a GP visit card.  To avoid a situation where eligibility ceases because the client was unable to respond to a renewal notice, an additional safeguard is now present in that a GP can, where appropriate, extend eligibility to allow the medical card holder a further opportunity to engage with the review process.As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The Hospital InPatient Enquiry (HIPE) records details on each inpatient and day case discharged from publicly-funded acute hospitals.  In HIPE, Gaucher's Disease is listed under the category of "Other Sphingolipidosis" which also includes a range of other conditions.  Total hospital discharges for this category in 2010 were 129 of which 120 were day case treatments.  It is not possible to estimate what proportion of these treatments may relate specifically to Gaucher's Disease.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	875	Ireland operates a tax-financed, residency-based health care system where entitlement to health services is primarily based on residency and means. The tax funded universal system covers the whole population guaranteeing health care either totally free of charge or at subsidised rates. In addition, there is a voluntary private health insurance system where individuals pay for the policies offered by private health insurers to cover possible hospitalisation costs in private hospitals or private treatment in public hospitals.Approximately 80% of health funding in Ireland is provided from public sources through the taxation system. At the end of March 2012, the most recent date for which figures are available, there were 2.139 million people, or 46.6% of the population, covered by private health insurance. Given the significance of private health insurance services, Ireland has always regarded voluntary private health insurance as a partial or complete alternative to the tax funded universal health care system, while providing a useful additional source of funding.  When individuals elect to be treated privately, they agree to meet the costs of the consultant's fees, which are a private contractual matter between the consultant and the patient, as well as the hospital's maintenance costs.It is not the role of the Minister for Health to determine the funding arrangements of facilities operating in the private health sector. I can, however, provide information on the total private health insurance claim amounts paid by the three open membership insurers (supplied by the Health Insurance Authority, a statutory regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland — although information in respect of 2008 in not available), set out in the following table.YearTotal Claims Costs2007€1,154m2009€1,616m2010€1,650m2011€1,704mIn addition, last year the Health Insurance Authority requested the private health insurers to provide a breakdown of their Returned Benefits for the second half of 2011 into public hospital costs, private hospital costs and consultant costs. The Authority has advised that the data shows that approximately 30% of the claims costs paid in the second half of 2011 relate to public hospitals, 50% relate to private hospitals and 20% relate to consultant costs.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	876	The Government is committed to fundamental reform of  healthcare in Ireland that will deliver a single tier health system, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not income.  In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme.The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance. The White Paper will outline the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. Preparation of the White Paper is a complex process. It will involve significant financial modelling to support analysis of different design options and to estimate the cost of UHI. Given the complex nature of the issues involved it is not anticipated that a White Paper on Financing UHI will be published before the end of 2012. Nevertheless, the White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government's term of office.

Officials from my Department are in discussion with the Road Safety Authority with a view to including a numeric code on the new licence to denote a person's wish to donate their organs after death.My Department is currently advancing legislative proposals for a Human Tissue Bill which will address the giving of consent for the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of organs and tissues from deceased persons in the context of post-mortems, transplantation, research, or anatomical examination.  The proposals also address consent for the use of organs and tissues removed from a living person for transplantation and/or research.   The Programme for Government commits to changing the system of consent for organ donation to an opt-out system from the current opt-in system in order to improve the availability of organs for patients in need of transplantation.  The logistics of this change will require detailed consideration and my Department will be consulting further on how best to implement it in the context of developing the Bill.

Section 54 is provided for in Part 5 of the 2010 Act. Part 5, which deals with changes to the penalty points system, and the associated provisions of Part 3, which deal with changes to the fixed charge system, will be commenced when administrative and technical issues have been addressed by the Courts Service and gardaí.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	884	The question relates to railway safety.  Matters relating to upgrading works at individual level crossings on the rail network are operational day to day matters for Iarnród Éireann. My Department is fully aware of the importance of railway safety and continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in railway safety despite the significant financial challenges. The overall investment in railway safety is in excess of   €1.5 billion since 1999 when the Railway Safety Programme commenced. Investment in Railway Safety in this year alone will be approximately €100m. It is a matter for Iarnrod Eireann to prioritise the use of these funds based on appropriate risk assessments.  However, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the safety risks at Railway Level Crossing XL083 at Kilshane in South Tipperary do not currently provide a level of intolerable risk to its users. I also understand that there are regular discussions between Iarnrod Eireann and local users in relation to any safety concerns that may arise and I will ensure that this will continue.   In relation to the Level Crossing at Kilshane, and the operation of railway services to Limerick through this area, Iarnród Éireann has emphasised to me that the safety of its customers, staff and those who interface with the railway, including level crossing users, is of paramount importance and they will continue to monitor the situation.

As a result, we have driver licence exchange relationships with other EU Member States. We also have driver licence exchange relationships with a number of other jurisdictions around the world. We establish these relationships only after detailed study and comparison of the licensing systems leads us, and the authorities in the other jurisdiction concerned, to the conclusion that their systems and ours have compatible standards.Unfortunately it has not been possible to reach agreement on driver licence exchanges with some countries with which Ireland has close historic ties.  This is because in some of these countries licences are issued not according to a single national system but at provincial or state level, with each province or state setting its own driver licensing criteria.I have however received a number of representations in relation to the exchange of driver licences with Canada and am having the matter re-examined to determine if a change of approach would be possible.

However, where a person is the holder of a foreign licence and has not exchanged this licence for an Irish licence, the endorsement of the points on the NVDF is not currently  possible.In such instances the penalty points record is suspended and the penalty points period does not "count down" in the fashion that applies to normal penalty points events. "Counting down" means that in normal circumstances, when a person has penalty points applied to their licence, those penalty points are removed after three years.The 2010 Road Traffic Act moved to correct this anomaly and under Part 5 of that Act will allow the NVDF;to create an official NVDF driver record for a person who amongst other issues, does not have an Irish licence record, or is the holder of a foreign licence; andto record multiple penalty points events against a driver record created in any of the aforementioned circumstances.Part 6 of the 2010 Act, which was commenced on 1st June 2010, expands the definition of a driving licence to include foreign driving licences so as to bring these within the scope of sanctions for road traffic offences including disqualifications.Without the provisions of Part 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 these penalty points could remain indefinitely in this limbo, which is an administrative arrangement to store the fact that the person has penalty points to be added to a licence record. In all these cases, the NVDF issues a notification of penalty points to the driver in question so the driver is aware of the situation.Part 5 of the 2010 Act and the associated provisions of Part 3, which deal with changes to the fixed charge system, must await the addressing of administrative and technical issues by the Courts Service and Gardaí. However, work is on-going with both the Court Services and the Gardaí, including any necessary changes to IT systems, in order to commence the relevant sections of the 2010 Act.When these provisions are implemented, penalty points will be applied to holders of foreign driving licenses, and they will be disqualified from driving in this State if they exceed 12 penalty points within a 3 year period.Discussions are currently taking place, under the North South Ministerial Council, between officials of my Department and the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland towards agreeing an arrangement for the mutual recognition of penalty points for certain road traffic offences. The work involved is complex and will take some time to complete.

The audited outturn figures are set out in the Annual Appropriation Accounts published by the Comptroller and Auditor General. These are a matter of public record and set out the funding for the Department's agencies.The details of funding provided by the agencies under the aegis of the Department to a multitude of small diverse businesses and organisations is a matter for the agencies themselves and these can be made available from the agencies should the Deputy require.  In the case of the sports capital programme, full details of individual grants to sporting organisations are available from my Department's website http://www.transport.ie/sport/projectsandprogrammes.aspx.  In the case of funding grants made by the National Sustainable Transport Office to local authorities and others for the development of smarter travel infrastructure, details of projects/recipients funded under the Demonstration Projects, 2011 Jobs Initiative Scheme and the new programmes introduced this year — Smarter Travel Areas, National Cycle Network and Active Travel Towns — are publicly available on the Department’s smarter travel website, http://www.smartertravel.ie.The Revised Estimates Volumes referred to above contain some overview information on staff numbers and pay for the Department as a whole and the individual sectors for which it has responsibility. The Department pays wages and salaries directly to staff members only.  At end of May, 2012, the Department employed 494 staff members. Civil service pensions are paid centrally by the Paymaster General from a central provision for Superannuation and Retired Allowances rather than from the funds allocated to individual Departments and Offices.The number of staff to whom wages, salaries and pensions are paid by individual agencies using funds provided by the Department can be obtained from the agencies should the Deputy require.

The club have not been in direct contact with the Department since that date.I recently wrote to the Deputy in relation to this matter pointing out that it is a requirement of the Sports Capital Programme that the grantee provide proof of payment of the invoices submitted in the form of a copy of their bank statement. I understand from the Deputy that the club are not in a position to provide evidence of payment in this manner.  As advised in my letter to the Deputy, the club should contact the Department as a matter of urgency in order to discuss how this situation may be progressed.

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The grounds for the refusal of permission for the bypass included the fact that An Bord Pleanála was not convinced, inter alia, that all possible traffic management alternatives had been fully explored. Statutory responsibility for traffic management rests with the local authority.  The NRA has informed me that it has undertaken to support Meath County Council in the examination of traffic management options. In this context Meath County Council has been undertaking additional traffic survey work and will be liaising with the NRA over the summer on the response to the Board's decision.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	901	This question relates to the Smarter Travel Bill which was introduced last year by Deputy Murphy as a Private Members' Bill and the related matters of electric vehicles and car clubs.  The purpose of the Smarter Travel Bill is twofold. First, it aims to promote electric car use by allowing local authorities to make bye-laws for the provision and use of charging bays on public roads. Second, it aims to promote the development of car clubs by allowing road authorities make bye-laws for the control and regulation of parking by car club vehicles on public roads.  I support the promotion of electric and hybrid vehicles as one of the ways to reduce pollution and improve our environment. With the current state of technology — which is advancing all the time — there are limits on the distance electric cars can travel before recharging. The provision of recharging points is, therefore, an important component in encouraging the use of electric cars.Car clubs have proven very successful in other jurisdictions, particularly in Germany and the UK. A particular benefit is that families often find that by joining a car club they can avoid the need for a second family car, especially in cases where they might need a second vehicle only occasionally. As with electric cars, I am also in favour of car clubs as a way of reducing the number of vehicles on our roads. I am, therefore, very happy to support appropriate measures to promote electric cars and car clubs.I have met with the Deputy on the subject, and conveyed my support from the principle of promoting electric cars and car clubs set out in his Private Members' Bill.  My Department is now engaged in work on the development of the next Road Traffic Bill, which I hope to publish at the end of 2012. This Bill will address a number of issues, and will provide an opportunity to consider proposals for facilitating electric cars and car clubs. As far as is possible, I intend to include the proposed measures from the Smarter Travel Bill in the Road Traffic Bill.

These programmes are now in place supplemented with targeted mass media campaigns focussing on the causal factors for deaths and injuries on Irish roads. It is also important to note that these mass media campaigns are also integrated with the policing plans of An Garda Síochána and other enforcement agencies.The Road Safety Authority's policy is to ensure that all road users develop appropriate attitudes and safe behaviours.  It has an established relationship with Local Authority Road Safety Officers and works collaboratively in the roll-out of sustained and integrated educational programmes that are evidenced based, relevant and appropriate for the road using public.Sadly, the month of June has gone very much against recent trends in terms of road fatalities. When you look at the monthly records over time, you will find occasional sharp fluctuations, followed by a return to the normal trend, but we do need to look closely at the details of these collisions to see if there is any pattern to the increase and the RSA and the Gardaí are doing so.

The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes which meet the requirement of the EU directive on driver licences. On this basis Ireland recognises licences from, and has mutual recognition and exchange of licence arrangements with, other EU Member States and a number of other jurisdictions where research and discussion has shown that standards in those jurisdictions match those here.The process of reaching an exchange agreement can be a long one, and involves a considerable amount of background work, generally undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in conjunction with the licence authority in the overseas jurisdiction in question.The RSA is always willing to examine the possibilities for driver licence exchange arrangements with other States based on the individual merits of the case presented.

The audit is designed to examine and improve, where necessary and appropriate, the application by local authorities of speed limits and speed limit signage throughout the country, in accordance with my Department's "Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits" which issued to all road authorities last year, as provided for under Action 34 of the Strategy. To assist with the audit, my Department requested all local authorities to provide information in relation to the current approach to the setting of speed limits and to speed limit signage.Earlier this year, I announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and my Department has established a stakeholder Working Group to progress this work. The Automobile Association, An Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority have accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group, which has met on two occasions since its formal establishment. As the Deputy will appreciate, this is a very complex issue which requires detailed consideration as it involves a broad review of general speed limits, along with the specific limits in place on certain roads. Additional meetings are scheduled to take place during the coming months and the Group hopes to have made substantial progress before the end of 2012.

The views of the regulatory authorities in relation to any bid;2. What is best for passengers in terms of connectivity and air fares;3. What is best for taxpayers in terms of the price we can get for the stake;4. What is best for the economy overall in terms of competitive access to services in and out of Ireland.

These funds were in addition to local authorities own contributions.State funding to assist local authorities to maintain regional and local roads is apportioned as equitably as possible on the basis of factors such as route lengths and population densities. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded on regional and local roads is a matter for the relevant local authority. Indeed, local authorities have considerable leeway, within their respective allocations, to direct funding to those works they consider most appropriate taking all local factors into account.In the current financial circumstances my priority is to protect previous investment in the roads network and ensure that the distribution of available funding is done in the most targeted manner possible. In this context my Department is supporting the use by local authorities of pavement management systems to identify priorities for future road works on the regional and local road network.Question No. 732 answered with Question No. 125.

The VAT reduction on a range of tourism services from 13.5% to 9% enhances the competitiveness of our tourism product. The Visa Waiver Scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to a trip to the UK and the halving of employers' PRSI for those on modest wages will significantly reduce the cost of employing people.Following discussions with the Minister for Finance, I was happy to be able to confirm that the lower rate of VAT will be maintained during 2013. This will allow businesses, tour operators and customers to plan for the 2013 season. The tourism agencies are also supporting many big events this year which will bring in overseas visitors including the Navy-Notre Dame American Football game, the Tall Ships in Dublin and the finale of the Volvo Ocean race in Galway. In addition, "The Gathering 2013" will take place next year —  a major tourism initiative with the target of bringing an extra 325,000 visitors here.While overseas visits to Ireland decreased marginally in the first five months of 2012, prospects remain good for the year as a whole. The tourist industry is positive about the coming months, reporting increased enquiries and advance bookings compared to this time last year.

There is general agreement about the importance of encouraging organ donation.I understand that the RSA is currently considering how best to accommodate the issue of organ donation and is examining the appropriate format for the driver licence application form and for locating an organ donor symbol on the licence itself.
