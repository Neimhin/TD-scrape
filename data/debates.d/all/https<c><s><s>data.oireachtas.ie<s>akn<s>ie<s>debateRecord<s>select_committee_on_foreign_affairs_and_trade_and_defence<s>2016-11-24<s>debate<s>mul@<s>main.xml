          <p eId="para_8">Tá áthas orm bheith i gcomhluadar an Chathaoirligh agus baill an choiste chun Meastúcháin Breise teicniúla i gcóir Vóta 28 don Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála a phlé.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> I am pleased to be here this afternoon for the committee's consideration of a technical Supplementary Estimate in 2016 for Vote 28 for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As members are aware, a technical or token Supplementary Estimate does not involve additional Exchequer funding for the Vote, other than a very small technical increase of €1,000. This is because corresponding savings or, in our case, corresponding additional fee income, fully covers the additional expenditure required.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Earlier this week, on 22 November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform moved a motion in the Dáil seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 for the Department and the approval to move excess income from appropriations-in-aid to fund increased expenditure on international contributions and on the Passport Service. The Department is seeking an increase of €5.001 million, which is offset by additional passport fee income of €5 million resulting, as already stated, in a net technical or token increase of €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The increased expenditure is being sought for Ireland's increased mandatory contributions to several international organisations - mainly the United Nations, UN, but also to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD - and for increased operational costs relating to the Passport Service due to an exceptional increase in demand of 10% in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases are fully offset by additional passport fee income of €5 million. The international contributions in question are Ireland's contributions to the organisations outlined, not just those of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but across all Departments which interact daily with, and benefit from, Ireland's membership of these valuable organisations. The mandatory contributions of Ireland and all other member states of international organisations are based on scales of assessments and these can vary.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The first purpose for which additional expenditure will be incurred this year relates to the Passport Service, which has experienced an exceptional increase in demand of an extra 10% applications this year compared with 2015. Last year, just over 680,000 passport applications were received and this is expected to grow to over 740,000 this year. There was a strong underlying increase in demand for passports in the first half of the year. Indications are that this will be further affected by the UK referendum on EU membership. From July to October this year, applications from Northern Ireland increased by approximately 70% compared to the same period last year, while applications from Great Britain have almost doubled.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> A significant proportion of the operational costs of the Passport Service are demand-driven and directly correlate to the level of applications. Consequently, the significant increase in demand has led to a proportionate increase in operational costs, particularly for passport books, postage, the printing of application forms as well as for additional temporary clerical officers and overtime. The relocation to Mount Street in the early part of the year resulted in increased challenges to maintain passport delivery within expected timeframes. I am proud that the Passport Service was recently, in the customer experience, CXi, survey, ranked number one in the Irish public sector. This survey confirms that the Passport Service delivers very strongly in facilitating travel for citizens, sometimes in urgent circumstances, and in ensuring that applicants are properly advised about their passport entitlements. I congratulate and thank the staff of the Passport Service for their commitment to delivering a friendly and efficient service. Gabhaim comhghairdeas agus buíochas le foireann Sheirbhís na bPasanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The largest source of increased expenditure relates to Ireland's international contributions, accounting for some €4.2 million of the additional €5 million on which the Supplementary Estimate is based. The largest element of this, Ireland's payments to the UN, consists of mandatory contributions to the UN regular budget, UN peacekeeping budget and UN tribunals which accounts for some €3.3 million of the additional funding included in the Supplementary Estimate. UN member states' contributions are based on a formula, called the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals. In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for the 2016-2018 period, with Ireland's rate set at 0.335%. The challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is not easy. The budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity around the world. This is influenced both by the number of conflicts, as well as the size and complexity of the UN operations which the Security Council decides to put on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> It is difficult to estimate this in advance, as an existing peacekeeping operation might be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established. Also, and this was the case for 2016, the timing of the bills for peacekeeping can cause problems in estimating costs. Normally, the majority of peacekeeping payments fall due in July at the beginning of the peacekeeping budget cycle. However, for technical reasons, every three years these bills are split between July and January. As a result, this year several payments that would ordinarily have been paid in full in July 2015 were split between July 2015 and January 2016. As a result assessments payable by all member states, including Ireland, in January 2016 were higher than usual.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> As regards the OSCE, we require an additional €450,000. The amount provided for in the Revised 2016 Estimates was €1.168 million. The amount spent in 2016 will be €1.619 million. The shortfall is due to the fact that the provision in the revised Estimates was insufficient. The amount spent in 2016 covers both Ireland's contribution to the OSCE unified budget, €1.070 million, and its contribution to the special monitoring mission in Ukraine, €550,000. Both these contributions are mandatory and arise from Ireland's participation in the OSCE, which is integral to long-standing Irish foreign policy goals of supporting human rights and the rule of law. The special monitoring mission in Ukraine plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The final international contribution which was under-provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates was a shortfall of €440,000 in Ireland's contribution to the OECD. The amount allocated in the Revised Estimates for 2016 was €2.26 million but the total amount to be paid to the OECD in 2016 will be €2.70 million. Member countries' contributions to the OECD are determined in part on the basis of the relative size of their economies and are thus affected by economic growth. The shortfall arises due to a combination of growth in the Irish economy and an underestimation of the likely final allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I trust that my remarks have clarified the purpose for which the Department is seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate but, of course, I will seek to answer any questions committee members may have. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht teacht isteach um thrathnóna agus an deis a thabhairt dom na ceisteanna seo a phlé.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2016-11-24T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">I thank the Minister of State for outlining the reason he is seeking extra funding. I compliment the staff on the excellent work that is done in the Passport Office. Every Oireachtas Member has a number of dealings with the Passport Office each month. I hope, with the agreement of the committee, that word will go back to the Passport Office. I have not known anybody who had to cancel a holiday because he or she could not get a passport. Sometimes one can nearly get a passport on the same day in cases of unforeseen circumstances. The staff of the Passport Office are understanding, they listen and will revert to members and discuss matters. In the context of the service that is provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade's office, Members of the Houses can e-mail the Department directly and they usually receive calls back fairly fast. I want to acknowledge that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Minister of State mentioned the increase in demand for Irish passports from 680.000 to 740,000. There is a rising demand from Northern Ireland, where there has been a 70% increase. The demand from Great Britain has more than doubled. The Minister of State may not have the information to hand, in which case I can table a parliamentary question, but will he indicate whether the additional applications have been approved or whether there have been instances of people chancing their arm and seeking an Irish passport due to having, for example, a great, great, great grandfather who was Irish? Since the election Mr. Donald Trump, has there been an increase in demand for Irish passports from the US, particularly in view of the fact that there are more then 40 million people of Irish descent in that country?</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Ireland is very well respected at the United Nations. Irish soldiers who serve with the UN peacekeeping forces abroad are also very well respected. I was travelling around Lebanon and met with various groups and officials and they had nothing but the height of respect for the members of the Irish Army that are on UN peacekeeping duties abroad. I visited the refugee camps within the Syrian border in a private capacity. I and a few Irish people were travelling with a few delegation of individuals from around the world. We had a security detail travelling with us and its members came over to the Irish party to acknowledge that they respect the Irish and that the Irish are very well respected in Lebanon. It nice to hear about the Irish Army serving with the UN in Lebanon. I support the Supplementary Estimate.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. I support what the previous speaker said about the Passport Office and the service the staff provide. I have dealt with numerous difficult cases and the staff of the Passport Office, who are all very competent people, handled them very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I am aware of the fear created by Brexit for our colleagues in Northern Ireland. I am a representative from a Border county, similar to the Minister of State. Will he expand on that situation please?</p>

          <p eId="para_25">I thank Deputy Grealish for his remarks. I concur with him on the level of efficiency and professionalism among the staff of the Passport Office in cases where, for example, someone is under pressure to obtain a passport in order to travel to a job interview or to university or for more personal or challenging reasons relating to a bereavement. I agree with the Deputy not just on the level of efficiency of the staff but also in the context of the empathy they show.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The Deputy will be aware that a major part of the passport process happens in his county at HID Global. I had the opportunity to visit that company's plant in the Gaeltacht community and it has been providing the physical product. Deputy Grealish was being very modest by not mentioning the company in question. I appreciate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">On the increase in the number of applications for Irish passports and to tie-in with Deputy McLoughlin's point about the statistical impact of Brexit, there has been a 70% increase in the number of applications from people in Northern Ireland. However, I assure Deputy Grealish that all passport applications are carefully vetted.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Deputy Grealish also mentioned the recent election in the United States. We do not have statistics which might indicate whether there is a trend in applications. However, there has been an increase in inquiries since the American election. I have some figures for New York. The figure for 2015 was 5,984 and that for 2016 was 6,209. On the west coast, the figure for San Francisco for 2015 was 3,660 and this rose to 3,849 to date in 2016. There is an increase but it does not coincide.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I have visited the consulate office in Edinburgh, the embassy in London and the consulates in Boston and San Francisco. The staff there do great work. They have to give advice in respect of that to which people are entitled. It is a very good service.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I agree that the Irish Army members serving in Lebanon are doing great work. One in three, more than 30% of the population in Lebanon, are people with refugee status. That says a great deal for Lebanon as a country</p>

          <p eId="para_34">They are from all over. I do not want to be parochial either but I had the opportunity to meet young lads from Ramelton in my county at a ceremony. They are doing great work.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> In response to Deputy McLoughlin's question on Brexit, from my time spent in Edinburgh and Glasgow a few weeks ago, I am aware that business carries on and there was great positivity regarding Irish and Scottish business working together at that event. We are looking at increases in respect of inquires about passports and also passport applications. We have a very dedicated sub-committee at Cabinet level, headed by the Taoiseach which held its fourth meeting this morning. There are significant proactive actions we can take in light of the Brexit result. There are lots of positives such as, for example, the business-to-business engagement between the UK and Ireland. I know that at a symbolic political level, whether it was the Queen's visit or the President's visit to the United Kingdom, the language around relationships has never been stronger. On the ground, one can see the incredible synergies between businesses on an UK-Ireland basis and companies feeding into the supply chain in Scotland. There is an infrastructure of which we must be conscious. I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland, which held a very successful trade mission in Edinburgh recently. At a political and a State agency level, we must be as proactive as possible, whether it is in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales or England.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I join other members in welcoming the Minister of State and his officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I have a few points that I wish to make, particularly about the passport service. Is it possible to indicate to us in writing, rather than verbally, who is entitled to a passport? There is confusion about whether a person who is a first or a second cousin may be entitled to a passport. The service provided by the Passport Office is second to none and a credit to everybody, including the departmental officials. It is seldom that I hear a complaint about the passport service and as a public service it is first class. Above all, its personnel always give the impression that they are trying to help people and it is not just a case of going through the motions. There is an ethos that should be recognised by us all. The personnel in question are behind desks and providing a service and never really receive recognition for the work they do. Many times they have to deal with somebody in the airport who is panicking as he or she has just realised he or she does not have a passport. There is always an attitude that personnel should try to help people rather than tell them to come back tomorrow. The service is excellent.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The fact that we are renowned for our part in peacekeeping missions is a great advertisement for Ireland. I have witnessed it at first-hand and we cannot underestimate the value to Ireland of our troops operating on peacekeeping missions. Very often we speak about the situation in Lebanon where we have 500 or so troops, but there are other areas where 20 or 30 members of the Defence Forces are serving on very small missions but who are playing a vital role. They do not receive the recognition they deserve. Again, I highlight the work done on all missions, including the small ones, as well as the big ones. The troops involved play such an important role in enhancing the image of the country. We cannot overestimate the value of their role as peacekeepers, nor can we overvalue Ireland's role as a neutral country and in not being tied to European armies or anything else. Our neutrality is very precious and allows us tremendous scope in participating in peacekeeping missions. We are not seen as serving some agenda or other but as being there purely to help. Expertise has been built during the years, dating back to the mission in the Congo, and it is second to none, as the Minister of State has seen at first hand. Small missions are just as important as bigger ones in various parts of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> I am glad that we are contributing to a special monitoring mission in Ukraine. Do we have many troops or officials there in that capacity or are we only subscribing to the overall cost for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe? I have a particular interest in the situation in Ukraine as it has been messed about and become a political football. It says a lot for the way the world works today when Russian troops can march into Crimea and just take over, without a finger being lifted to say boo to Russia as such. There are sanctions, but the situation is horrific. I have had the pleasure of being in Ukraine on a couple of occasions and although they are making tremendous strides, they need ongoing support. I am delighted that we are contributing in some way to stabilising the country and allowing its people to pursue their independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> It is always great to have an opportunity to say thanks to those who serve on UN missions. We cannot overestimate the value to the country of those ambassadors who serve throughout the world.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2016-11-24T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_41">The Minister of State and his team are most welcome and I thank them for their presentation. I know that all of my colleagues have touched on the work of the Passport Office. It is interesting that the Department is seeking an increase of €5.001 million, with €5 million being offset by the increase in revenue from the Passport Office. That is direct evidence of the work it is doing. The 10% increase in demand has resulted in an extra €5 million for the Exchequer, which has allowed us to cover the additional cost of our contributions this year without having to look for much more from the country's funds. It is incredible and significant evidence of the fantastic work the Passport Office is doing. I join my colleagues in commending it.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I am heartened in going through the table of specific programmes with which we are involved by the number of people serving at home and abroad who are working for a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world. We are advancing prosperity and promoting our economic interests internationally, while protecting and advancing Ireland's values and interests in Europe and strengthening and influencing our capacity to deliver on our goals. Although austerity has permeated nearly every aspect of our life in the past few years, we have continued to maintain our interactions and work internationally and remained committed to advancing our core values in foreign affairs. It is a credit to the country that we have managed to do this during the years, particularly given the increased pressure to cut and cut some more. I commend the Department for its work in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I will go through some more specific contributions to international organisations within which we operate. Our most significant contribution is, as we know, made to the United Nations. UN operations are a major source of pride to the country and its citizens, as well as for those who serve or have served in the Defence Forces. There is no doubt that they are very well trained and equipped. They do fantastic work abroad and Ireland is very well regarded by international colleagues when it comes to defence matters. Our contributions to the United Nations are based on a formula, with the scale of assessment reviewed at three-year intervals. There was a new scale introduced in 2015. How does it compare with the previous one? Have our contributions increased or decreased since the previous assessment? The Minister of State has indicated that the budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity. I appreciate that demand can very often change, in reacting quickly to what happens globally, but how do we even attempt to estimate what our contributions will be, given the volatile nature of both UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions?</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I have a question about the OSCE. The Minister of State has indicated that there was a shortfall owing to the fact that the Revised Estimates were insufficient. Why was that the case and where was the mistake made? Was it due to a lack of information? I have had some contact with the OSCE. It is a very valuable organisation, of which Ireland is a member. As international as well as Irish citizens, it is vital that we participate in organisations such as the OSCE to contribute to international peace and support human rights and the protection of the rule of law. These are objectives which Irish people value. I am very happy to see that Ireland is participating fully in the organisation. I am interested in hearing a little more about the monitoring mission in Ukraine. Where exactly is the money going? Do we have any direct control over where it goes or is it included in a general budget for the entire project?</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> I have a question on the OECD.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Again, there was a shortfall in the Estimates. Why was that? It was estimated to be €2.26 million for 2016 but the actual amount paid will be €2.7 million. Again, it is a considerable sum of money and I wonder why that shortfall is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> How are our contributions calculated? We know they are calculated on the basis of our economic growth but is that done every three years or every year and what figures are used? How have we fared over the past number of years? Have our contributions to that organisation increased? That concludes my questions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_15" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2016-11-24T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_48">To take Deputy Barrett first, I acknowledge the service and agree with him about it. The entitlement to a passport is based on citizenship in the first instance and determined by law. There are two automatic categories. If one is born in Ireland or one's parents were born here, that is automatic. Then, one has the grandparent facility, but that is after registration. As such, there is a registration process. Then, there is naturalisation and we have many new citizens in the State as a result of that process. The Deputy is right about having that information available on the Passport Office website. I am sure it is readily available. If there is anything specific that would be of benefit to the Deputy, we will organise its provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> One of the officials showed me a passport card today. It is useful and it prompted me to apply for one. I admit I do not have one. It will get one around Europe and is handy because it can be kept in one's wallet. Obviously, one needs a passport to get the passport card. If Deputy Barrett does not have one either, we could jointly apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> He talked about the role of our missions. He is absolutely right that, big or small, they are doing a phenomenal job internationally. I can see that the roles are changing and that they are adapting to new challenges and ways of communicating. The best example of a person using social media is Mr. Dan Mulhall in London who one sees tweeting most days. In the smaller embassies such as the one in Edinburgh, there is a greater capacity to engage with community. It is very bottom up and when one speaks to members of the Irish community or those who have an affinity for Ireland within the Scottish community itself, they talk about the great work that goes on at grassroots level.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I mentioned empathy earlier. The high profile example was Mr. Philip Grant in San Francisco and the work he did during the Berkeley tragedy. At the time, it was a very personal thing for him in his role. I received feedback on that from meeting different people out there and he has had an ongoing engagement. It is the follow-through that is very significant. He is still doing work and different aspects of legislation in California are being looked at. He is still in touch with all the families. That empathy and investment in humanity that all our ambassadors and consuls general demonstrate all over the world is something into which I have been given a bit of an insight. I note the work of Mr. Dónal Cronin in Uganda and I will be meeting with Dr. Vincent O'Neill in Kenya next week where Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will be joining me. The work Mr. O'Neill's team has done in advance of our visit next week has been going on for months and then there will be the work of following that visit up.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> Where Government needs to raise the bar is in terms of our strategic approach internationally, whether sourcing investment or otherwise. That is a message for myself and our political colleagues. It is in the follow-through. Embassies and missions can only do so much as their resources are limited. A whole-of-Government approach to using our State agencies better, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, is needed. We have to look at a more strategic approach. The Department of Foreign Affairs is already initiating that. At the moment, it is working on an Asia strategy and last week it was working on an American strategy. It is not just about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; there has to be a whole-of-Government buy-in across Departments. That will bode well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Deputy Barrett also mentioned Ukraine and our work there. Ireland makes an assessed contribution to the monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreement. This is also a mandatory contribution arising from our participation in the OSCE. We are providing a monitoring role. I acknowledge Deputy Barrett's comments on the challenges out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a series of questions. If I leave anything specific out or I fail to get back to her, the officials will follow up on some of her observations. She mentioned the reduction and asked what was missing in relation to the assessment and the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals. In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for 2016 to 2018 with Ireland's rate being set at 0.335%, which was down from 0.418%. The reduced rate is the result of Ireland's depressed economic performance over the preceding years. Deputy Chambers was correct to say it was measured against our economic performance. I acknowledge her point that, even during the years which were difficult economically and otherwise, we continued to face our international challenges in a proactive way in relation to our work with different organisations as well as financially. The taxpayer should be constantly reminded of the figure. When I set it out, people are often startled. From 2011 to this year's budget, the Irish taxpayer contributed €4.5 billion in contributions to overseas aid. Notwithstanding the fact that since 2008, some €28 billion came out of the economy and that a great many hard and difficult measures were taken, as the Deputy said herself, the Irish taxpayer still contributed €4.5 billion. It is a phenomenal contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> While there are still challenges about getting to the 0.7% target, we can work better in terms of that strategic approach. We should not simply be waiting for the next budget to come along to see if there will be an increase or decrease and, if so, how much it will be. Rather, we should be a bit more ruthless in relation to the 0.7% target and set out a five-year plan. The committee has been working on and made proposals around this and it is important that we are clear about trying to provide a continuum towards the objective of reaching the 0.7% target. On the other hand, as the economy improves the percentage decreases, but that does not make up for the fact that we need to get up to a different place.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I was asked about UN missions. We are in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Ivory Coast and Cyprus. Deputy Barrett asked if we were in Ukraine, but these are the ones we are in at the minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> A few issues were raised about scale and Deputy Chambers asked how we estimate our contributions. It is difficult. It is a best-guess scenario because everything changes so quickly. I mentioned in the Dáil yesterday some of the figures we got from the International Committee of the Red Cross this week. To take the example of Chad, 9 million people are displaced from that country at the moment, the majority of whom have refugee status in Somalia and Ethiopia. In the context of a total global displacement figure of 65 million, 9 million are from one country alone. In Italy, 25% of refugees are from Eritrea, from which country 5,000 people leave per month. One is looking at the scale of movement and displacement of people and everything is changing. The challenge is absolutely enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I would like to acknowledge all of those involved in peacekeeping missions as well as Irish Aid, whose personnel I have got to know very well and with which some of the Deputies here have worked very closely over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">It is doing great work in terms of rising to the challenge. The responsibility on the EU and UN is massive. The world is changing by the day. We need to also focus on the positives, including the hosting by Uganda, despite its own challenges, of 500,000 people in temporary refugee status. We can draw inspiration from what is being done in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Uganda. While there are positives, the reality is that the challenges are enormous. </p>
          <p eId="para_60"> In regard to how we estimate our contributions, that is done on a best guess analysis. </p>
          <p eId="para_61"> My officials will communicate with Deputy Lisa Chambers on any of the questions to which I have not responded. On the OECD, the budget submission was based on the estimated balance of the 2016 contribution and advances on assessed contribution for 2017.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2016-11-24T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_62">I am aware the Minister of State's recent visit to Canton in the US. I also visited the US recently to attend a wedding. During my visit I had a meeting with Mayor Marty Walsh regarding the undocumented Irish and he assured me that Boston will retain its sanctuary status in that regard. As the Minister of State will be aware Boston, New York, Chicago and San Francisco are cities of immigrants. During my visit, I also met a number of Irish people working in the trade area whose driving licences are nearing expiration. These people need to be able to drive to get to their places of work. When a person is stopped by the police in the United States, the first thing he or she will be asked for is a driving licence. If that person does not have a driving licence, he or she is arrested. The point was made to me by these people that when their passports expire, they can apply by post to the consulate office for a new one - everybody knows that a passport is a more valuable document than a driver's licence - but when their driver's licence expires, they cannot renew it because they are required to return home and present themselves at a driving centre to get it. In reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue, I was told that a person living abroad in a particular country for a specific period should be able to obtain a driver's licence in that country. Unfortunately, undocumented people, particularly in the United States, do not have a social security number and so they cannot produce the documentation required to get a driver's licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Many people are living in fear because their driver's licences are due to expire. I have asked the Minister to look into undocumented Irish people in the US being permitted to apply to the consulate office for a driver's licence, as they do in respect of passport renewals. I do not know why a person has to present in person to pick up a driver's licence. That appears to me to be a little crazy given one can get a passport through the post from anywhere in the world. It should be possible for people to renew their driver's licence at any of the Irish consulate offices throughout the United States. I accept that this is not a matter relevant to today's discussion but it is an issue I would like the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to examine. This is a serious issue for the undocumented in the United States which needs to be addressed jointly by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Transport, Tourism and Sport. I ask the Minister of State to ask his officials to contact the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to see if some resolution can be found to this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I am big into our status as a neutral country. I do not think we sell it enough and I do not think we make people conscious of the value of our neutrality. There is need for greater effort on the part of the Department, perhaps by way of statements, on what it means to be neutral and the value of being linked to the United Nations and so on. There are constant attempts to drag us, one way or the other, into a European army and so on. That is not what I signed up to Europe for; we must protect our neutrality and create an awareness in the public mind of the value of our neutrality and the role of our peacekeepers and so on. I ask that every effort be made by the Minister of State and the Department to ensure greater awareness among the public of what it means to be neutral. People need to be assured that we are not second-class European citizens because we have not joined the European army brigade.</p>
