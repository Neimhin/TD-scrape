          <p eId="para_35">I imagine that one of the first duties will be to meet and have discussions with various regulators.  It will be up to the Chairman and the clerk to decide how the meetings are arranged.  That is how we will best read ourselves into the brief.  As an oversight body concerned with matters outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, we should get to know these people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_36">This is a moment of <i>déjà vu</i>.  I wish the Chairman well.  The agenda refers to the Commission on Aviation Regulation.  At the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny we had an interesting discussion on an EU directive on airport regulation.  This committee could examine it.  The Chairman could read the debate of the committee.  The regulation will be implemented early in the new year and it is bad for competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I am not sure if I am in order proposing that which I am about to propose.  The role of ComReg in broadband could be examined.  When I table a question to the Minister with regard to a specific location I am told that it is an operational matter for the various service providers.  Given that it is Government policy to roll out broadband and achieve maximum penetration, does ComReg have a role and where does it lie in respect of this committee?</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_38">It has a role but unfortunately that specific issue is for the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Our terms of reference refer to the effects of regulations and regulators.  We must examine how they regulate the industry, rather than the day-to-day running of what is proposed.  As public representatives we see over-regulation of various sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">This committee has two aspects with which to deal, namely, economics and regulatory affairs.  I propose we begin with regulatory affairs and, as members suggested, bring the regulatory bodies before the committee one by one to see what they do and how they affect the policies they implement and familiarise ourselves with what they do.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_43">When should we hold our next meeting?  We should have been up and running five or six weeks ago and have a great deal of work to do.  I suggest we meet by the second week of January to put together a framework of how we will progress.  Will we have a discussion with one or two of the regulatory bodies?  Perhaps we should meet to decide a work programme.  We should hold a number of meetings in January.  Is that agreeable to members?</p>

          <p eId="para_54">This committee can play an important role in holding regulators to account and examining their accountability and effectiveness.  However, the regulators also have a role to come before the committee and discuss the challenges of their roles and, in some cases, recommend changes required in the regulatory environment.  It may sound overly beureaucratic—</p>

          <p eId="para_56">We can examine how the regulators do their jobs and the regulators can make recommendations for changes.  We are in a new era of regulations and several regulators have not been in the job for long.  This is an opportune juncture to examine how they perform.  I am mindful of the plethora of quangos which have sprung up in recent years.  A key role of this committee will be to pull it all back and ensure bodies are held to account and regulators do a decent job.</p>
