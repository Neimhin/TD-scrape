#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	The Minister will be aware that, last May, gaps in the number of inspectors were identified in various regions throughout the country. At that time the Minister gave a guarantee that the gaps would be filled. How many additional inspectors have been appointed since May? Will the Minister also indicate the regions of the country where these inspectors are now working?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	During 2013, I have prioritised implementation of a preschool quality agenda. This represents a long overdue and long-awaited programme of measures to support, monitor and regulate the improvement of quality standards in preschool services in Ireland. For the first time I have ensured that preschool inspection reports are now online. There are 1,672 reports online, including the most recent 12 reports on inspections that have been conducted on preschool services in recent weeks. A key element of the preschool quality agenda has been strengthening the national preschool inspection system. The HSE has statutory responsibility for preschool inspections and there are currently 38 whole-time equivalent preschool inspectors in post. I wish to advise the Deputy that the HSE is at an advanced stage of recruiting five additional inspectors to strengthen preschool inspection in Louth, Dublin south-east Wicklow, where two will be recruited, Cavan-Monaghan and Sligo-Leitrim-west Cavan. These are areas where gaps were identified. On foot of budget 2014, I will also be allocating €4.5 million in Exchequer funding to support the implementation of the preschool quality agenda, with €500,000 of this funding to be allocated next year towards the cost of further increasing staffing levels to strengthen the preschool inspection system. This will be augmented by additional funding from the annual registration fees payable by preschool services, to be introduced as part of statutory registration. The number of additional inspectors to be recruited to the inspectorate as a result of this extra funding and the location of those posts will be decided upon by the new child and family agency in consultation with the Department. The recruitment of additional inspectors is only one element of the reform of preschool inspections. Management reforms are under way and the new agency will be established next year. These include a programme of work to strengthen the preschool inspectorate to ensure greater consistency nationwide. As I have often stated, there has not been a national plan for the inspection of preschool services up to this point.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 A practical outcome of this work has been the introduction of standard operating procedures earlier this year, which should address the issue of inconsistencies and provide clarity and transparency to early years services. The comprehensive preschool quality agenda, which my Department is progressing, will also address other key preschool inspection reforms, including publishing inspection reports online, strengthening the national inspection system, introducing new protocols on regulatory compliance and enforcement, increasing and widening the sanctions that can be taken for non-compliance, introducing a registration system for all preschool services and implementing new national quality standards. The legislative provisions to underpin these reforms are contained in the Child and Family Agency Establishment Bill 2013. This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of preschool services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for inspectors at pre-prosecution level. Under the proposed new system, all preschool services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with and the threat of removal of registration will be available. Currently, 1,679 preschool inspection reports are published online. The new national quality standards for preschool services will be launched shortly. These will complement the existing preschool regulations replacing previous explanatory notes and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the regulations will be measured. I am confident that these comprehensive reforms will provide for the operation by the child and family agency of a more consistent and robust preschool inspection regime.

Will the Minister confirm that there will be no gap in any location after the five additional inspectors have been hired? She stated the recruitment process is at an advanced stage. Will the inspectors take up their positions this year or early next year? Regarding the funding allocation of €500,000 for additional inspectors next year, what eligibility criteria will be used to determine to which regions they will be allocated? Will I have time to contribute again?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I will revert to the Deputy.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Some 43 inspectors should be in place by the end of the year. The Louth recruitment is happening this week. The others are at an advanced stage. I expect that those four inspectors will be in place in the coming weeks. Regarding the funding I have received for the extra ten inspectors next year, the HSE will consider the areas of greatest need. For example, two of the inspectors being recruited now will be allocated to the Dublin area. Some parts of the country have more early years services than others. The allocation of the ten extra posts will be based on levels of need in various counties. In the UK, for example, inspections are carried out approximately every two years. In Ireland, the average is 18 months. However, we want to ensure that this is the case in every area. Where there are many early years school services, we will clearly need more inspectors. If a concern about a particular service arises, we want to ensure that inspectors are in a position to visit it at short notice. Allocations will be based on levels of need in various counties. For the first time, a national manager is in charge of this area. I expect that the team will be in a position to make those decisions.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	Given that we are taking on new inspectors and looking at the qualifications of service providers, would the Minister consider that it is an appropriate time to examine the qualifications of those carrying out the inspections? Will the Minister take on board the recommendations from her expert advisory group on early years, the workforce development plan and an OECD report on child care concerning inspectors' qualifications? The Minister said the new registration fee will help to fund additional inspections. Will she confirm whether this new fee is an additional one for child care providers or will it replace the existing fee for registered child care providers? The Minister said she hopes that preschool and early childhood settings will be inspected every 18 months. We are now bringing forward the necessary legislation on Committee Stage. Would it not be prudent and wise to insert in that legislation a provision to inspect such establishments every 18 months at a minimum, if the Minister so desires? At the moment, the legislation refers to inspections happening "periodically", which could lead to a longer timeframe for inspections.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	There is a nominal fee at present. This is a registration fee in accordance with the legislation we are debating concerning the child and family agency. That will be a new fee, although the amount has yet to be agreed. Account will be taken of the varying types of services, including private and community ones. The details of that are being worked out and I will liaise with the Deputy. I am sure it will come up for discussion on Committee Stage of the legislation next week. We are fortunate that so many people have undertaken further qualifications in early year services. There is a lot of expertise but, to date, there has not been a career path for such people. The new mentoring scheme, which was announced in the budget, will begin to be implemented next year and will give scope for career advancement. The question of inspections should be examined and we could consider people with a wider range of expertise in that regard. It is clear we are at a transition point with the new agency, so we need to allow that transition to go ahead. The issue the Deputy has raised is an important one, in that we can bring in people with experience of the child care sector. Environmental health officers and public health nurses are working very well, given the challenges they are facing in the sector. That is an issue that can be discussed in due course.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I wish to ask the Minister for an update on the recent disturbing cases where children from Roma families in Dublin and Athlone were taken into care. Has the Minister received the HSE report or the report of the Garda Commissioner? Is she in a position to confirm that the Ombudsman for Children has received both reports? Is Ms Logan's inquiry under way? Is she directly involved in this exercise now and when will she report her findings and recommendations?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The Deputy refers to the two cases of Roma children who, following Garda action, were removed under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 and provided with foster care immediately while investigations took place. This has clearly been an extremely distressing situation for the families concerned. In the first instance I have asked Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the national director of HSE children and family services, to ensure all possible supports are made available to the families from statutory or voluntary groups should they wish to avail of them. The use of section 12 is a power of the An Garda Síochána which is used in very particular circumstances. The Deputy will be familiar with the Child Care Act and the clear directions which are given therein. By its nature, it is an exceptionally used power to secure the safety of children. Under section 12 a member of An Garda Síochána takes such action when they have “reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child”.Child protection is a complex and sensitive issue. An Garda Síochána and the HSE are often required by law to deal with very complex situations and to make immediate decisions when dealing with concerns which come to their attention. It is important to review such incidences to ensure that practices and procedures are in line with best practice. My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and I felt that there should be examination of the involvement of An Garda Síochána and the HSE in these two cases. In this regard, I have asked Mr. Gordon Jeyes to provide me with a report and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has also requested a report from An Garda Síochána. The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, has initiated an investigation into these cases and has also agreed to undertake an investigation of An Garda Síochána's actions under section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 and under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. I can confirm that I have received the reports for each of the cases from HSE children and family services but I have not yet received the Garda Commissioner's report. The report I have received was referred immediately to the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, for consideration. The Ombudsman for Children is an independent statutory authority and will independently assess the actions of the HSE.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	May I conclude by saying-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	If I allow the Minister to run over time we will not reach the other questions.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	In respecting the independent investigations of the Ombudsman for Children, it would be wrong of me to make further comment.
Additional information not give on the floor of the House
 I look forward to the conclusion of the process and to addressing the independent findings of the Ombudsman for Children, once she reports on her investigations.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	What happened in these cases is a far cry from what we expect from our State child care and support services. Everybody is clearly of this view. Under the Child Care Act 1991 the Garda Síochána must, as referred to by the Minister, have reasonable grounds to believe there is an immediate and serious risk. I am disappointed to hear that the Minister has not yet received a copy of the Garda report, which is referred to in some detail in the media. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has received the report and was able to elucidate on it. I believe the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, should seek receipt of the report as a matter of urgency. It is important that the HSE and Garda Síochána reports are looked at together. I am anxious to know the reasonable grounds on which it was believed that the children in these cases were at risk or in danger. These are serious questions. I understand there were other children involved in one, if not both, cases. Why were those children not taken into care? Why were only those children who had a particular hair or eye colour as the case might be taken into care? While I agree that we must await the report and recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, we must not delay in making it clear to those who are responsible at the coalface of dealing with cases such as this that the required test in this particular instance could have been undertaken without taking the children from their homes and parents. What immediate steps has the Minister taken to ensure there will be no recurrence of such dreadful cases as these?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	We have asked for an independent report. It would not be appropriate to be deciding on the outcome or to make any references to what actually happened until such time as that report has been received. Many people are jumping to conclusions. I do not know how those conclusions will be dealt with by the Ombudsman for Children. We do not know precisely what she will come up with. We do not know the details that led to influencing the Garda Síochána or social workers. We must respect the independent investigation. The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, is well respected. It will be worthwhile awaiting her report, following which it will be acted upon. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is still drawing up the terms of reference required to allow the Ombudsman for Children to investigate the Garda Síochána, which is a new power for her. This work will be concluded within a few days. I have no doubt I shall shortly receive the report from the Garda Commissioner via the Minister for Justice and Equality. Neither the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, nor I have commented at all. I have noted the media reports but neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Shatter, have spoken about these cases and will not be speaking in detail about them pending the outcome of the investigation by the Ombudsman for Children.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	That is not the case.The Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated to the media that the confidential Garda report into the seizure of two Roma children from their parents shows they acted in good faith. The preparation of the report continues, but the issue is in the media and it is not good enough, because of the horrors involved in this instance, to say that we will do absolutely nothing until such time as Emily Logan reports. I am doubly concerned because this is the fourth week after these dreadful events were first revealed and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is telling me that the terms of reference are being drawn up and have yet to be presented to the Ombudsman for Children. This dillydallying is simply unacceptable. This is a very worrying situation for many people and it requires more expeditious address than the Minister's responses are indicating. When will those terms of reference be presented? Will Ms Logan's report have a timeframe so that there will be no further undue delay? Having argued that the Ombudsman for Children should be brought in as the independent person responsible, I have every confidence that the Minister will do the right job and make the right recommendations, but I do not want everything parked in the meantime.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The Ombudsman has the terms of reference as far as the inquiry into the HSE is concerned and she can clearly get on with that element of the report. That is covered by the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, so there should be no delay with it. I am merely quoting from the Minister for Justice and Equality that on receipt of the report from the Garda Commissioner, he wanted to draw up the terms of reference to ensure that they were appropriate and that he had the opportunity to study the reports which had been submitted to him. He said the terms of reference would be finalised within the coming days. There is absolutely no delay. Both reports have been submitted within the two week timeframe that was agreed. My report has gone to the Ombudsman for Children and I have no doubt she will receive the report from the Garda Commissioner very shortly, as well as the terms of reference from the Minister for Justice and Equality. For many decades in this country there was a denial about the suffering of children. Many people turned a blind eye and it can be difficult to get the balance right for the front-line workers when they are in these situations. We certainly do not want the community, gardaí, social workers or anybody else turning a blind eye to concerns about children. I am sure the Deputy agrees that we do not want to return to that situation, but it is important that we examine precisely what happened in these two cases. We will have an independent investigation by the Ombudsman for Children, which is the right thing to do.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	This question is essentially about the rights of adopted people and the delays they are experiencing in accessing information about their birth mothers, or vice versa where mothers are seeking information about their children. The problem is twofold. First, there is a problem with accessing the existing files. Second, there is a delay in legislative changes, which have been promised since the Government was elected. There is also frustration about some of the religious orders denying people access to that information.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I am conscious of the concerns of those who are seeking information about their birth mother or a child given up at birth. The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the HSE implement much more improved and consistent arrangements for people in such circumstances. Quite a number of actions have taken place and I wish to inform the House about them. Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE regional adoption service in Cork. We did not have any national approach to these files until after the Adoption Act 2010. We now have 25,000 files in Cork from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, County Cork; Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, County Tipperary, and Castlepollard, County Westmeath. The HSE also has records that include those for St. Anne’s Adoption Society, St. Mary’s Adoption Society in Kerry, Ard Mhuire, in Dunboyne in County Meath, Limerick Catholic Adoption Society, St. Patrick's Mother and Baby Home, Navan Road in Dublin, St. Louise's Adoption Society in Dublin, the Dublin Health Authority Board of Assistance, the Rotunda Girls Aid Society, the Ossory Kilkenny Adoption Society, and St. Kevin's and St. John's adoption societies.The HSE is also in negotiations regarding files from Holles Street, St. Brigid's, and St. Patrick's Guild. Furthermore Pact, which is an agency accredited under the Act, has records of various Protestant organisations. A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations, is available on the HSE website. In order to deal with the point the Deputy raises, the HSE has also put in place a plan to redistribute records from individual institutions to the various adoption teams around the country in a concerted effort to reduce waiting times. The HSE is also in the process of reorganising the information and tracing system to allocate social work resources countrywide in a way that will allow for reduced waiting times across the country.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House 
 The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the HSE community services which will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records. The HSE is working to provide a more streamlined service and to ensure that inquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible. The national adoption contact preference register was established in 2005 to help adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences. They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed. The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the national adoption contact preference register. The authority has stated that there were 796 applications in 2011, 542 in 2012 and 526 to end September 2013, with a cumulative total of to date of 7,426 adopted persons and 3,312 relatives applying to register. The authority, the HSE and accredited adoption services routinely inform inquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up. I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the contact preference register and where possible to consent to the release of information. Work is continuing in relation to the preparation of the heads of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill. I am anxious to bring the heads of the Bill before Government at the earliest possible date. The constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. I have agreed with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that, once agreed by Government, the heads of Bill will be the subject of committee hearings so that the complex and sensitive issues involved can be the subject of public consideration.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	There is a great deal of information in that response and I respect the Minister's bona fides on this issue but that said, and sincerely meant, there are inordinate delays in this process. Two years ago, in an answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me about the Sacred Heart files being transferred to Glanmire. She has now confirmed that there are another 11 institutions whose records have been transferred. There were over 42 mother and baby homes and there are tens of thousands of people whose identities are wrapped up in that information. I gave the Taoiseach information a couple of weeks ago about somebody who had searched the files for decades and been frustrated in accessing that information but who was able to get it within ten days with the assistance of the Adoption Rights Alliance. Would the Minister consider enlisting the help of volunteers such as the alliance who have been pioneers in this situation? I also need to know where the legislation is in this regard because we have been too subservient to the 1998 court judgment about consent. We could be much more proactive in delivering some of that legislation.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I will make two points in response to the Deputy's questions. I will speak about the legislation in a moment. I take the Deputy's point about work done by voluntary organisations. I have met them and am very happy to work with them but we have a national adoption contact preference register. That is the best place for mothers and for adoptees who want to trace their families. They can put their information onto the national adoption contact preference register. To date, the cumulative total on that is only 7,426 adopted persons and 3,312 relatives applying to register. One can contrast that with the number of files I have mentioned today, 25,000, which is not the total number of files. We certainly need to ensure that everybody who wants to trace and make contact with their families is at the very least applying through the HSE or the Adoption Authority of Ireland to have their names on the national adoption contact preference register because that is the first step. As regards the legislation, I have very serious legal advice that suggests that retrospective information is not constitutional in this country.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	The Minister's reply raises two problems, first, far too many people have come forward with their experience of being frustrated when they sought to find their identity for it to be a coincidence. It is clear that there is a problem in the system. My office alone receives contact from many people who have been deliberately frustrated. The Minister's reply to questions I have tabled have acknowledged that the volume of inquiries in Glanmire was so great that the centre could not grapple with it. I do not know if that is a resources or a blocking issue. Second, the answers to questions about legislation have changed over the past few years. Two years ago we were told it was close to completion but now we are told there are serious legal problems but the only case is that of 1998 the judgment which many people believe is seriously flawed. Given the stories which even in the past week have hit the airwaves about the many women who did not give consent, or whose documents were forged, it seems to me that the whole area of so-called privacy could be better tested.They have a decent humane system in other countries where people have access to their identities. It is not complex and we can do the same here.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	It is different here because we have a Constitution that respects privacy and there are real issues in this regard. My approach to the legislation has been to make it as broad as possible in order that people can access information. These are the instructions I have been given and that is the way I have been working. I have been getting legal advice all the way through and I intend to publish the heads of the legislation and refer it to committee in order that the constitutional and other issues can be addressed. We can hear from all the non-governmental organisations involved in the area and have a full airing of the issue. It is a matter of great public concern. There are strict legal parameters. It is not only about the 1998 case. It is also about recent European court rulings that have respected the right to privacy. The legal advice I have currently suggests that retrospective information is a difficult matter within the parameters of our Constitution. Having said that, I am keen to make the point that there should not be deliberate frustrating of anyone who seeks to get birth information where consent has been given. I gather these are the cases to which Deputy Clare Daly is referring in particular. That is unacceptable. The HSE is working to ensure greater access for people to the data and the executive is organising the data in the way I have outlined.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	In light of the recent publication of the Minister's expert group report on early years strategy, will the Minister explain the reason or outline the rationale why child care affordability was not given prominence or consideration in the report given that the affordability of child care in Ireland is possibly one of the greatest issues and challenges facing the sector?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	It is a pity this issue did not get more attention in the years when there was so much money around and when child care was a major issue for so many couples who were combining their work and family responsibilities. I am very much aware that affordability in respect of child care services is a major issue for Irish parents. We have lagged behind other countries, and there is no question of that. That is one of the reasons I set up the early years group with broad terms of reference. I asked the group to set out its views on what should be in the early years strategy. I set no restrictions on what the group could discuss or on what the recommendations should be. The report the group produced, Right from the Start, reflects the group's views. I appreciate the work done. It was a wide working group representing the sector and those who have an interest and who work in this area. It is clear from the recommendations in the group's report that there was consideration of affordability of child care despite the Deputy's suggestion. There is a reference to high child care costs. There are recommendations referring to increasing investment in early care and education services without increasing parental fees and to extending the entitlement to free preschool provision. The argument put forward by the group for State support for quality improvements in child care services would see this important parental priority addressed with support from public funding, and this is what we are doing. I announced the Government decision in the budget to provide €4.5 million towards quality supports for preschool services. This will be of considerable benefit to parents, children and providers. The extension of entitlement to a free preschool year is also of considerable relevance to the affordability of child care. The financial benefit of that preschool year, which was a good legacy, is of great help to parents in terms of costs, and a second year would save parents approximately €3,000, a considerable amount. The group recommended that before we move on to do that, we need to address quality issues, and that is what we are doing with the mentoring and training programme.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	There had been considerable investment in the past decade in respect of child care and a total of 70,000 child care places were created. The Minister adverted to the free child care year. This is a serious issue. Yesterday, we heard the results of a survey, including that 55% of people aged between 20 and 49 years said the cost of child care was an issue and that 25% or one in four people in the country believe they are too poor to start a family.When one considers the terms of reference for the advisory group the Minister has assembled, it beggars belief that this issue was not given the prominence it deserves.

I acknowledge the Minister is undertaking work on quality child care.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Deputy Troy, I will come back to you but I must call on the Minister.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	My question to the Deputy is why, when in government, his party gave back more than two thirds of the funds for the early child care supplement, that is, of the €480 million that was allocated to child care at the time? Had that money been retained and invested in child care services, it would have gone a long way towards providing free child care but not a cent of it was reinvested in quality supports or in new inspectors either. Clearly, there is an historical legacy of a lack of investment in subsidised child care. During the boom, apart from the preschool year, no additional supports were introduced to child care services to ensure that parents were not obliged to pay the amounts they must now pay. It is not that the providers are charging so much, because as Members are aware, many workers in that sector are not earning much money. However, no subsidy is in place because over the years, direct payments were given to parents, as opposed to building up the sector. That said, I wish to move to a position in which that second year is in place and in which quality services are available that can be supported to develop. I agree with the Deputy in that as the economic situation improves the entire question of child care costs and support for that sector should be a priority.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Earlier this year, the Minister had hoped to introduce a second preschool year in this year. I am glad she has come around to my way of thinking because I had articulated and identified the existence of quality concerns in respect of the entire preschool and early year setting. I am glad this issue is being tackled because quality child care is a necessity, not a luxury, and it is imperative that quality child care be available. When I raised this issue last April, the Minister spoke of how, as growth returns to the economy, consideration can be given to subsidising child care. However, we lack a clear pathway, framework and strategy as to how this will be done, apart from the Minister stating her hope that a second preschool year would be introduced in the coming years. This is the reason a cost analysis of child care should be conducted to examine precisely how child care will be subsidised in the future. It is not right that 55% of young people aged between 20 and 49-----

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	Will the Minister give a commitment to carry out a cost analysis of child care in order that a clear framework and strategy can be put in place as to how this issue will be tackled in the future?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I reject the Deputy's comments, as for the first time an early years strategy is in place. I remind the Deputy it is the first time there has been a national early years policy. It is the first time in recent years that a group has been established to specifically examine the sector and to make a series of recommendations that effectively will form the framework for the recommendations on how the child care sector will be developed. Clearly, as the economic situation improves and as the Government deals with the mess it has inherited in respect of Ireland's economic sovereignty, investment in child care is one of the key areas that must be prioritised.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I seek from the Minister her personal response as Minister to the Health Information and Quality Authority's report into the Rath na nÓg high support unit, Castleblayney, County Monaghan.I also seek her views on that report being employed to effect its closure and the closure on same campus site of the educational facility associated with that unit. While I have noted that there are plans to redesignate the site as a child well-being centre and that these are part of the future plan, I want to address the first core part of the question I submitted. The Minister has not responded to me on this point. I wrote to her in this regard two and a half weeks ago but I have not received a reply.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I will ensure the Deputy gets a reply to that letter. As he will be aware, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recently published a report into Rath na nÓg high support unit outlining serious concerns. As I have said previously, Gordon Jeyes, the HSE's national director for children and family services, had met HIQA officials in September and had discussed the report with them. He informed them of his intention to close the unit by the end of October. The HSE has confirmed to me, as the Deputy will be aware, that the unit is closed. I was very concerned to learn of the risk to the safety of children in the unit and I welcome the decisive move by the HSE to close Rath na nÓg. As the Deputy said, the HSE has advised me that the premises and resources at Rath na nÓg, Castleblayney, County Monaghan, are being redesignated to provide services as a centre for children, a child well-being centre, where they will receive supports. It will provide specialist, time-limited intervention to children within the catchment area in conjunction with local social work services under the auspices of the children and family services area manager. I hope this community resource will be of great benefit to children and families in the local area. As I have publicly announced, the HSE has advised me that it is undertaking a national review of all residential care which will result in a reconfiguring of high support and special care units to meet the demand for special care. That review will be completed in the first quarter of 2014.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	Has the Minister taken appropriate steps to establish why the national office would have instructed staff at Rath na nÓg to apply a lock-up situation there each night during the hours from 9 p.m. until 7.30 a.m. the next day? This is the core of the objections HIQA had, yet the staff were working not on their own volition but in response to a directive they had received. That directive has been defended by Mr. Jeyes, indicating that in his view any reasonable parent would behave in exactly the same way. I take a very different view. If there were real difficulties at Rath na nÓg, it is most likely that they were consequent on inappropriate placements or an inappropriate case mix rather than any failure or falling down, as it were, on the part of the highly qualified and experienced staff there. No matter how well trained and how well motivated the staff were, once the children were placed under lock and key, something that was never part of the institution in terms of that facility given that it was an open unit, and regardless of whatever relationships were being built upon, it was clear the young people were going to view those highly trained, highly professional and dedicated staff as their jailers and the relationship would collapse.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The Deputy has gone over time. I must call the Minister.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	It was never going to succeed once that situation applied. I would like to know what the Minister has established in regard to the facts of that directive.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	Let us put this in context. More than 6,000 children are in care in Ireland. A tiny proportion, 0.3%, and that is rightly so, are in residential care. They represent some of the children and young people in Ireland who are most in need of specialist care, protection and intervention. Poor standards cannot be accepted when working with our young people in any setting. The closure of the unit was deemed to be the most effective response to the serious and ongoing failings identified and the decision was taken in the context of a broader review as well. This was an operational decision taken by Gordon Jeyes. He did it with the best interests of the children at the core of his decision-making. Any decisions that were taken in relation to the children were to ensure they were safe. That report, which I am sure the Deputy has read, outlines serious concerns about risks such as fire safety, self-harm and bullying.They were not actively managed and the children were at risk. That is why the decisions were taken by Gordon Jeyes. I respect 100% the decisions he took in the management of this unit. I believe the right decision was taken to close this unit.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	The implication of the Minister's statement is that in some way the staff at Rath na nÓg were responsible or implicated or had fallen down in their responsibilities. That is not the case. Given it is acknowledged by Mr. Jeyes that the direction relating to the lock-down which created the fire hazard in the first place came from his office, does that not concern the Minister? Will this situation present at the only other open facility in the north east at Crannog Nua, Portrane? What is the situation there? Is this approach and practice in situ there? Are we looking at a further HIQA report that will facilitate the closure of that facility as well? We cannot all be codded all the time. We need to know the facts and the truth and it is important at the outset of the Child and Family Agency that the confidence and expectation of people that a new era is coming in be fulfilled. I am deeply worried and I put that to the Minister in writing but I still have no reply.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	The Deputy should be concerned about the detail in the report, which outlined serious and ongoing failures that were not actively managed. HIQA officials go in to inspect residential facilities. They went in and they found serious difficulties so much so that there was active involvement and engagement by HSE staff, including the director. Instead of criticising the director, we should praise him for the active role he took in managing these serious concerns. The concerns at the core of the HIQA report were as follows: "There were serious and ongoing failings identified. They were not being actively managed enough". This is an independent report. Gordon Jeyes managed that situation and he decided in the best interests of those children that the service should be closed.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I stated in my contribution on Second Stage of the Child and Family Agency Bill that while the new structures were positive, all the best structures and policies in the world will not achieve what the Minister has set out to achieve if they are not properly resourced and if there are not sufficient social workers available to carry out their duties. There is significant concern in the youth care sector that resources will not be provided. New social care places have been promised but they have been slow to come on stream. Will the Minister reassure the House that all children in care are being looked after?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	The Deputy made her comments during the debate on the legislation to establish the new agency, the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013, which is progressing through the Oireachtas. The agency will be established on 1 January 2014. It will assume responsibility for a wide range of services for children, including child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE, preschool inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and community-based psychology services. The agency will have available to it the existing resources of the HSE children and family services, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. Control of this voted expenditure will transfer to my Department in the revised Estimates volume to be published in advance of establishment day. The latest monthly performance report for September 2013 shows 6,465 children were in care, 91.9% of whom had an allocated social worker and 87.8% had a written care plan. While both are not at 100%, performance has improved dramatically over the past number years when the percentage was in the 80s and we are seeing improvement. The vast majority of these children are cared for in a foster care setting, which is unique to Ireland. This is important. As of 30 September 2013, a total of 1,385 whole-time equivalent social workers were in post across children and family services. The number includes all 270 posts recommended in the Ryan report.Recruitment is ongoing and the retention of social workers, in particular in those front line positions in child protection, in common with other countries in Europe, is very difficult. There is a very high level of maternity leave. Currently, there are 100 social workers on maternity leave. We are filling vacancies but it is an ongoing challenge to keep the numbers where we want them.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 As regards the issue of vacancies, I can advise that 114 social work vacancies have recently been filled with a further 136 posts due to be filled shortly, of which 51 have been accepted by candidates and are expected to commence post in the near future.  The 2014 budget, which was published on 15 October last, includes an additional €6.7 million - €12 million in a full year - to support the ongoing programme of reform of child welfare and protection services. This additional investment will support the child and family agency in ongoing reform aimed at improving the quality and capacity of child protection and welfare services, in line with the very significant priority placed upon these improvements by Government.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I thank the Minister for her answer but I am not entirely reassured by it. The number of social care workers is being stretched to the limit. Ireland has relatively few child protection workers per head of population and in relation to the total number of children in care. Many of the reports carried out in this area have highlighted inadequate staffing. What is more is that HSE figures show demand for HSE children and family services is increasing for several reasons, not least the economic climate and the consequent increase in reporting and, in particular, putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing, which will create further increases. I believe the Minister has approved 60 new social care positions. Will she give a timescale as to when these promised new places will come on stream?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I will revert to the Deputy on the last question because I do not have those details with me. I will communicate directly with her on those 60 posts. The 2014 budget included an additional €12 million in a full year to support the ongoing programme of reform of child welfare and protection services. The Deputy is right that there is ongoing pressure on the services. There is no question about that. There is an increase in referrals to child and family services and very complex cases are coming to the fore. The reform and reorganisation will help with that because we will work more effectively with the NGO sector and the child and family support agency. There will be clearer assessment when cases are referred in the first instance so that if the case is a child protection concern, it will be referred to the child protection team. If it is a family which needs family support, the closer working relationships and the alignment of priorities between the HSE and the NGO sector will mean that families will get better supports.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I await the Minister's answer on that. Recently, when I raised a case with her about a child who was not getting what she should have been getting, the whole thing was sorted out in a matter of minutes following one telephone call by her Department to the social care workers.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I seek detail from the Minister on the impact of reductions in her Department's funding for 2014 across the various areas of its responsibilities. I am particularly interested in the youth programmes, the school completion programme, the national longitudinal study, the national children's strategy, the early intervention programme and the child and family support agency and why it has been signalled in regard to 2014, given that we are looking at an entirely different structure. When will that come about?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Estimate provision for my Department in 2014 will amount to €449 million. The allocation consists of €414 million in current expenditure and €35 million in capital expenditure. This level of investment demonstrates that while operating within difficult budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments for children and families. The overall resource allocation is especially significant when account is taken of the €8 million in savings which are built-in as a result of commitments made in the comprehensive review of expenditure 2012-14. Details of these savings to which the Deputy referred and the programmes' savings to which they refer are set out fully in the 2014 expenditure report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 15 October last in the context of budget. As the Deputy said, these include a reduction in commitments under existing contracts in the national longitudinal study and national children's strategy, savings as a result of completion of the pilot stage of the early intervention programme, a targeted reduction on the school completion programme and savings in administration and programme costs associated with the operations of the Family Support Agency. Unfortunately, there is a reduction in funding for various youth programmes but I have succeeded in getting a large scaling-back of the proposed reductions in the comprehensive expenditure review required in this area.The reductions will now be far less than those proposed in that review. My Department is finalising the proposed allocations for youth programmes in 2014. I emphasise that to the greatest extent possible, savings are being achieved through increased efficiencies, operating efficiencies and value for money to protect front-line initiatives. Like Deputy Ó Caoláin, I clearly value the front-line work that is being done. Of course we have to live within our budget. Given the allocation for 2014, I believe we will be able to provide a significant level of public services in this area, including a number of new policy initiatives that have been funded in the budget.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I am particularly concerned about the indicated cutback of €3 million in youth programmes. There is no doubt it will have a serious impact. It is unquestionable that this needs to be revisited. The Minister indicated in her reply that a total of €8 million will be saved. The 2014 expenditure report shows that the actual figure will be €9 million. Can the Minister clarify whether €1 million has been restored? My supplementary question relates to the proposal to make savings of €2.1 million in 2014 with regard to the Family Support Agency. We are currently dealing with the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013. I presume we will conclude the passage of that Bill this week. We had hoped to finish addressing the legislation 12 months ago or earlier, but here we are. As I have said, the Minister is providing for savings with regard to the Family Support Agency. When can we expect the child and family agency to come into being? Why would there be savings under the Family Support Agency in 2014 if the Minister did not expect that agency to continue into 2014, at least in part?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	As the Deputy knows, the legislation is going through the House. I expect the agency to be established in January following the successful enactment of the Child and Family Agency Bill, which we are currently considering. I thank Deputies Ó Caoláin and Troy for their support for the passage of that legislation. I know everybody is committed to ensuring the agency works effectively. Despite the current economic situation, the budget, including the HSE element of the budget which has been maintained, will enable quality services to go ahead. As the Deputy knows, savings for my Department and every other Department were earmarked in the comprehensive review of expenditure. While that remains the situation, I have managed to secure a significant scaling-back on that. For example, an extra €1 million was allocated for youth services in the budget. I believe that will make a quality difference and will ensure not only that the reductions will be few in number, but also that they will be relatively minor. I would prefer if there was no reduction in the youth budget, but there has been a significant scaling-back on the reductions that were initially proposed.

When does the Minister expect to see that project completed? I note that no provision has been made for extra staff in 2014. Can the Minister elaborate on the expected recruitment of additional staff to operate the new facilities at Oberstown? Some €6.7 million has been allocated for the reform of child welfare and protection services upon the establishment of the child and family agency. Can the Minister elaborate on the reforms that will be provided for as a result of that allocation? Finally, is funding being provided for the recruitment of crèche inspectors? Is that something we will see early in 2014?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	Yes. Five inspectors are being recruited at present. A budgetary allocation of €500,000 for extra inspectors is being made in the budget for next year. Extra inspectors will be recruited in 2014. Decisions on where they will be based will be made by the national director who is managing that service at present. A capital allocation has been made in the case of Oberstown.The construction has started. All of the planning issues have been dealt with. The construction started approximately one month ago and the buildings are on target. In line with that, I previously got a commitment on the recruitment of 60 additional staff who will be needed in Oberstown. Deputy Ó Caoláin had a further question on the €6 million for child protection services. I was pleased to get that allocation because, as I stated to Deputy McLellan, the services are under pressure and I imagine that money will be primarily used to deal with the level of referrals and to assess what extra staff are needed to deal with the kind of numbers that are turning up to the child and family services.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	I understand, from the Minister's comment in answer to Question No. 2, that the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Logan, has initiated her investigation and has started her independent report, but I was of the opinion that a ministerial order, under section 42 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, was required. I inquired on a couple of occasions from the Department about the terms of reference and I am told that they are still not sorted. I wonder if the Minister would agree that the terms of reference should be broad rather than narrow.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	Yes, and I believe that they will be. It is one of the reasons that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was waiting to get the initial report before finalising the terms of reference. For example, much comment has been made about the media coverage of these cases. That may well form part of a range of issues which need to be considered. On any necessary matters which should come within the scope, it is up to the Ombudsman to decide, under the terms of reference of the Act under which she operates, how broad her investigation can be. Under the terms of reference she already has by virtue of that Act, she has a great deal of leeway. Equally, the area where the terms of reference, as Deputy Wallace correctly states, must be drawn up is in relation to the Garda Síochána because it does not come under her remit at present and must be provided for specially by section 42 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, as amended by section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, to conduct an inquiry.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	Given that the HSE reports seem to indicate that both actions were probably Garda led, and in the Athlone case involving probably solely Garda action, why is the Ombudsman for Children investigating what seem to be principally Garda actions? Her remit, under statute, is only to look at HSE powers and if it was otherwise, we would not have to introduce legislation to give her extra powers. We already have the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, set up as a statutory body to investigate Garda misconduct, but yet the Minister for Justice and Equality seems to be ignoring and bypassing the specific statutory role and remits already set up under law. Surely, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is in a better place to deal with issues relating to gardaí. It is structured in that manner. There is the statute in place to deal with it. Why are we asking the children's ombudsman to deal with something that is more fit for GSOC?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	The Ombudsman for Children is the appropriate person to investigate this. At its core, this investigation is about the removal of children into care and then going before the courts system, which must happen as soon as a section 12 action is taken and the HSE gets involved. It involves the relationship or involvement of two agencies - the Garda Síochána and the HSE social workers and services - but in relation to children. Children are at the centre. Considering the detail of the events that happened, I believe it is the right decision to refer it to the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Logan. She has undertaken many reports into the involvement of State agencies with children. In a number of previous reports, she has examined the kind of services that children get. She is well placed to examine this precise situation. I believe her report will be comprehensive and thorough because that is the way she does her work.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	It is difficult to comprehend.I do not doubt Emily Logan's ability to investigate matters relating to the HSE. Perhaps the final report will prove me wrong but it appears that the Garda played a stronger role than the HSE in the removal of the two children. Given there was no risk of flight as the families had been here for seven years and were not nomadic - and even if they were nomadic, the authorities should not discriminate on grounds of nomadic culture - could the Garda not have taken a DNA sample? Could they not have guarded the place if they were really worried about flight rather than remove the children from the family? Surely the Minister would agree that this was a clumsy effort. It is not as though the children and the families will forget about this next week. This will stay with them. Would the Minister not agree that this was a very heavy-handed and clumsy effort?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I will take questions from Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Boyd Barrett. We are very short of time.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	From what we have read, the role of the HSE and social workers was quite limited in both these cases - non-existent in one and hardly evident in the other. The Ombudsman for Children obviously has expertise in dealing with State agencies and children are the very clear victims in this scenario. The Garda Síochána is a particular State agency that is difficult to investigate. The body statutorily set up to do that is the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. We must make changes to allow the Ombudsman for Children to investigate the Garda in a field in which she does not have that capacity currently, which seems a bit remiss to me. Could the Minister confirm whether the role of the HSE and social workers was minuscule and whether the media, which played a huge role in respect of why the Garda intervened in the first place, will be covered?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	On a point of order, I have a question that is almost the same word-for-word as those tabled by Deputies Wallace and Troy. Why was it not grouped? The Department makes the decision. Why were these questions not grouped together? It is exactly the same question.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I did not make that decision.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I would like an explanation from the Minister. If she cannot give it here, could I get an explanation as to why they were not grouped? They should have been grouped. For a child to be taken from their parents, which is the most extreme course of action, the child must be assessed by qualified professionals such as social workers or psychiatrists as being at imminent risk of harm. The Minister, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, should take this seriously because there is no evidence and I do not believe any evidence will be brought forward that there was any assessment that this child was at imminent risk of harm. Since when did gardaí act as social workers and make those assessments? The only thing we have in the public domain as evidence of why they acted as they did was the fact that a child had different colour hair and eyes from their parents. The last time I looked, that was not a crime and, therefore, the Garda had no role in this whatsoever, or is it acceptable for gardaí to make an assessment on whether a child is at imminent risk of harm? Qualified psychiatrists often wait six months after they have given an assessment that a child is in danger and they cannot get the State to act, yet here the State police acted to seize a child - to kidnap a child, in effect - when no qualified professionals had made an assessment that this child was in danger.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	It is all very well for the Deputy to make those points but I want to point out that for many years people in this country turned a blind eye to child abuse and did not take action. That is not for a moment to say that inappropriate action should be taken but I want to make that point because I have report after report on my desk where action was not taken by the relevant people. It is important to remember that. Regardless of whether one is talking about Monageer or the report of the independent child death review group, people repeatedly did not intervene. In respect of the Ombudsman for Children, we have asked for an independent report and I do not believe it is appropriate to predict its outcome based on media reports to date. Deputies should support having an independent report by the Ombudsman for Children who is getting the initial reports from the HSE and the Garda and will then make her findings.She will provide a completely independent report. It is commendable that she has the powers to investigate the Garda Síochána as the independent Ombudsman for Children. I believe that is a very important step, and it is the right thing to do. However, we should not pre-empt the findings of the independent report. The reason we set up the independent report is to answer precisely the questions the Deputies have raised today. We will receive that report. The Ombudsman for Children has not given a timeframe for it, but as soon as she has the report, we will make it public. Let us wait and see what precise details led to the actions that were taken by the Garda and the HSE. Emergency section 12 orders must be taken when a child is at immediate risk. It is an important part of our child protection service that the Garda has those powers. The Garda must protect children who are at risk.

#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	In the aftermath of the "Prime Time" investigation into preschool care, "A Breach of Trust", there was considerable concern about how to ensure the failures highlighted in that programme would be rectified and prevented from recurring. The programme found that most preschools are inspected once every 20 months and that many experts believe the child care regulations are too basic and poorly enforced. Compliance levels were also found to be low, and the programme concluded that 75% of preschools and crèches were in breach of the child care regulations. Can the Minister outline what progress there has been since then?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	There has been huge progress and massive change. The first point is the fact that we now have 1,672 inspections of child care facilities online. This is the first time these reports have been available online. Previously, parents or the media had to submit a freedom of information request to get access to those reviews. We also have the most recent inspection reports provided immediately online on an ongoing basis. There are now 12 of those online. That is the first major change. The second is that we are currently discussing legislation to register services. Providers did not have to register services up to now, but we now have registration. The third change under way is that we are changing the way inspectors inspect the facilities. We will shortly publish new national standards against which the inspectors will judge the early years services. That is a major change and will be very helpful regarding the points the Deputy correctly outlines about concerns in respect of quality. The other change under way is that the State, for the first time, is investing in quality in early years services. We are setting up a mentoring programme. There will be at least 40 mentors throughout the country who will work with the early years services to improve standards. It has been proven internationally and in Ireland, through pilot programmes, that the way to improve quality standards is not just through inspection but also through working directly with the providers in improving the quality of care they give to children. That is under way at present. We have invested in a training programme for those who wish to increase their qualifications - from next year it will be mandatory that they have FETAC level 5 qualifications to work in this sector - to ensure the FETAC courses will be undertaken by more people.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	While I welcome many of those changes, more progress is required. This country does not provide child care properly. We have outsourced, in effect, it to the private and voluntary sectors and the State has abdicated its responsibility. We do not invest in child care properly either. Even after the introduction of the free preschool year, we spend 0.4% of GDP on preschool education, which is approximately half of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average. Many countries spend far more. There is a need for reform generally in the area of preschool education. In particular, the first priority is ensuring welfare and that standards are adequate in the sector. The "Prime Time" report found that 34% of crèches were in breach of five or more regulations and that 29% were in breach of regulation 19, concerning overcrowding and upkeep of premises. Will the Minister give a more up-to-date report on compliance levels and whether there has been a substantial improvement in that area? I understand the HSE recently began the process of uploading inspection reports online. Will the Minister outline when the reports from all counties will be available online?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	There is a huge amount of work involved in reviewing the reports and ensuring there is a standardised approach for the future. That is being done. As I said, the inspection reports are being published county by county. It is just a question of the time it takes. We expect that by the middle of next year, all the reports on inspections that have taken place will be available. It is important to remember there has been a huge increase in the number of preschool services from the late 1990s to now. It has increased from 1,000 to 4,700. In terms of inspecting those 4,700 and ensuring there is quality, I agree with the Deputy there has not been enough focus on this. That is changing with the initiatives I have outlined. I am confident, too, that there is a greater awareness among parents with regard to questioning their providers, asking them about the inspection reports and raising any quality issues they have. That is very healthy. There is a range of initiatives under way which should deal with the issues the Deputy outlined and the concerns about quality.

It is heartbreaking to watch the reports of the national media on the scenes of devastation throughout that country. We are all thinking of the people there and of the many decent, hard-working members of the Filipino community working in this country. I commend the Government on its immediate offer of €1 million in aid. I urge the Tánaiste to investigate, as quickly as possible, the possibility of sending the rapid response unit to help in rebuilding that country. Last week, the Central Bank published a report which indicated a huge increase in the number of people using licensed moneylenders. We are already concerned about the many unscrupulous unlicensed lenders working in this country. Across communities, the bulwark against these lenders is the credit unions. The Irish credit union movement has been diligent in combating such people, who charge exorbitant rates. Where banks have refused money to families and individuals, many have gone to their credit union where they found that the small sums of money they required to live on a daily basis were made available to them. The circumstances resulting in Newbridge Credit Union being taken over by Permanent TSB are very unfortunate. There was something particularly unedifying in seeing the Central Bank go to the High Court on Sunday evening, which I believe was prompted by reports on the local radio station, Kfm, that this was going to happen this week.The process has taken two years and has been inordinately expensive, costing upwards of €3 million. The end result is that the people of Newbridge have no credit union. Does the Tánaiste agree that the methods employed by the regulator and the Central Bank have been spectacularly unsuccessful? Will he confirm the Government's support and respect for and acknowledgement of the fact that the credit union movement throughout the country has delivered a great deal of vital support for communities? Responding to a Topical Issue some time ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, indicated that 30 other credit unions may have been in trouble. In today's media, including the Irish Independent-----

In today's Irish Independent, Charlie Weston suggests that approximately 100 credit unions, some one in four, are in difficulty. Will the Tánaiste confirm that the Government's approach will be to ensure that, where credit unions get into difficulty, credit unions will be in place in local communities at the end of the resolution process to serve people's needs? Will the Tánaiste consider Newbridge specifically and ensure that the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank support the local community in its immediate efforts to establish a new and fully compliant credit union?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	I join with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, on behalf of the Government, in communicating our sympathy with the people of the Philippines, who are enduring a terrible natural tragedy. I acknowledge Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's welcome for the action that the Government is taking in providing emergency funding straight away in the form of €1 million through NGOs. We are also providing some practical assistance through tents, blankets and emergency facilities of that kind. We also have a rapid response core of technical people, which is ready to assist. We will work with the UN agencies to mobilise the greatest possible international response to that tragedy. The Deputy asked me a number of questions arising from the action that was taken in respect of the Newbridge Credit Union. That action was taken in order to protect the members and savings of the credit union and to prevent a situation arising whereby the credit union would have to be liquidated. Other options had been looked at over a period of time, including the possibility of an amalgamation of that credit union with another credit union, but that did not work out. The Deputy has asked me a number of specific questions and I want to answer them directly. First, on the Government's position in respect of the credit union movement, the Government supports the credit union movement. Credit unions in this country have provided great support to people. They operate with a not-for-profit ethos and on the basis of solidarity. I want to tell the Deputy directly that the Government continues to support the credit union movement. We back that in practical terms by having €500 million available in two funds to support the credit union movement - a fund that provides for restructuring of approximately €250 million and another fund for resolution of another €250 million. Specifically regarding Newbridge, as the Deputy knows there were a number of exceptional circumstances in that case. The average loan issued by credit unions throughout the country is €7,764. There were 26 loans of an average €550,000 in Newbridge. There was one loan of €3.2 million, which was in excess of the Credit Union Act's restriction of a maximum of 1.5% of the total assets. Some 53% of loans exceeded five years' duration as opposed the maximum set out in the Credit Union Act of 20%. The Government would like to highlight its support for the future return of a credit union to Newbridge. We will work with people in Newbridge to that end. The Deputy asked specifically about the reports in the newspaper about the number of other credit unions that may have difficulties. He mentioned a figure of one in four credit unions possibly being in difficulty and reports to that effect. There are 392 credit unions in the country. Based on the data submitted by the credit unions themselves, as of 30 September 2013 some 20 credit unions have reported regulatory reserves below the minimum requirement of 10% of assets. This gives rise to a capital shortfall in the region of about €11 million in total, but this has to be put in the context of the funds that the Government has made available of about €500 million. The Central Bank - this may be where the reportage has taken off - is working through a portfolio of approximately 100 credit unions on a case-by-case basis. This relates to issues that arise in those credit unions - levels of arrears, inadequate bad debt provision, high fixed asset to total asset ratios and other supervisory concerns. However, the actual number of credit unions that have reported regulatory reserves below the minimum requirement is 20 of the 392.

I take from his comments that the approach of the Government and the Central Bank will be to ensure that there will be credit unions in communities if changes have to be made on foot of resolution processes. I also thank the Tánaiste for indicating clearly that the Government and, I take it, the Central Bank will support the establishment of a new, fully compliant credit union in Newbridge. However, will he assure us that the procedures employed in Newbridge, which have been ongoing for 22 months at a cost of upwards of €3 million, resulting in there being no credit union to service the people of Newbridge, will be examined? What is the position as regards the directors of the Newbridge Credit Union, who were subject to a gagging order, resulting in their being pilloried in the local and national press? They were accused of many things. They can now defend themselves and attempt to vindicate their good names. What is the position on the building in Newbridge? Many people involved in the credit union movement across the country will wonder what will happen to their buildings if they become subject to the resolution process. The assets and liabilities of Newbridge Credit Union have been transferred to Permanent TSB. So be it, but what is the position on the building, which was built by, paid for and owned by the people of Newbridge?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	The position in respect of Newbridge is that the assets and liabilities, excluding the building, have been transferred to Permanent TSB by way of the High Court order. In addition to that, the Governor of the Central Bank has requested a financial incentive of up to €53.9 million, which has been agreed to by the Minister for Finance. That money amounts to €23 million in cash up front to fill the hole in the balance sheet, restructuring and integration costs of €4.25 million, €2 million for other transferring liabilities and a risk share on the transferring loans whereby the State will absorb 50% of the losses where loans perform below their transfer values and 50% of the gains where they perform above their transfer values. If these loans were written off immediately with no recovery, it would result in an additional €24.7 million total cost. Without the transfer to Permanent TSB, Newbridge would have been liquidated. There would have been a loss of €1.1 million in unprotected savings.Other options were examined concerning Newbridge. As I mentioned earlier, there was the option of amalgamating with another credit union. The Central Bank also assessed other options, including the proposal by the Newbridge action group. That was rejected at the time because it did not provide a satisfactory solution to the capital deficit.  The Government will support whatever efforts are made to re-establish a credit union in Newbridge, whether that is a credit union from somewhere else establishing in Newbridge, or the local community establishing a new credit union there. We stand ready to support that because the Government has a strong commitment to the credit union movement and the work it does. We want to see successful credit unions and we hope that we will not have other situations like Newbridge. 
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	Ar dtús, I want to join with the Tánaiste and an Teachta Ó Fearghaíl in expressing my solidarity with the people of the Philippines. Aontaím leis an Taoiseach agus leis an Teachta Ó Fearghaíl faoi na daoine bochta ansin agus cuirim fáilte roimh an tacú atá á thabhairt ag an Rialtas do na daoine sin. Inniu tá ceist agam faoin aos óg agus an dífhostaíocht. Tuigim go bfhuil an Taoiseach i bPáras inniu ag bualadh le ceannairí ón Aontas Eorpach le fadhb na dífhostaíochta i measc an aosa óig a phlé, ach sa Stát seo tá an Rialtas ag gearradh siar agus ag déanamh ionsaithe ar sochair ár n-aos óg.  In October, the budget took almost one third of the jobs seeker's allowance from young people aged under 25. Benefits for 20,000 young people were cut by €44 per week. The Tánaiste claimed at the time that this was to encourage these young people to get back to work. He denied that this had anything to do with the Government's austerity policy and he committed to investing in the Youth Guarantee scheme to provide jobs, training and education within four months. A leaked document from the Department of Social Protection, however, has revealed that the Government will not keep to its commitments. I am sure the Tánaiste knows that the International Labour Organisation has estimated that a decent youth guarantee, like the Swedish model, will cost approximately €6,600 per participant. Is the Government putting that sum into the scheme here to help unemployed young people? No, it is putting a miserly €260 into the pockets of each of these young people. Does the Tánaiste accept that the Youth Guarantee scheme is woefully inadequate and encourages youth emigration? The 2014 action plan for jobs sets out seven priorities, none of which includes youth unemployment or youth emigration. Why is this so? If the Government is serious about the Youth Guarantee scheme and getting our young people back to work, why does the 2014 action plan for jobs not include youth unemployment or youth emigration as priorities to be tackled?

Why does he get up and twist everything? We all know that there is a very big problem with youth unemployment in this country. That is why the Government has made tackling the jobs crisis - and youth unemployment, in particular - a priority. Happily, we are seeing some progress. At the height of the crisis in 2009, there were 83,000 young people unemployed. The figure is now down to 59,000.

That is why during the course of Ireland's EU Presidency we led a proposal to tackle the issue of youth unemployment in this country and across Europe, and agreed proposals for a youth guarantee scheme. In addition to agreeing the proposals, we went on to provide European money for the scheme. The original proposal was that this would be dealt with over a seven year period leading up to 2020, which was far too long. The problem of youth unemployment is here and we must address it now. That is why we front-loaded EU funding to 2014 and 2015 in order to deal with it. In addition, we have provided for a range of initiatives which are being taken by the Government across the education and training areas. Youth initiatives include the JobsPlus and JobBridge schemes, Intreo and Momentum. A range of such measures are aimed at getting young people into employment. We have reduced the eligibility for getting onto JobsPlus from 12 to six months. We have also provided for an additional intake of 1,500 young people on the JobBridge scheme. We have ensured that there are an extra 1,000 places on the Tús scheme and we have ring-fenced a minimum of 2,000 places in the various Department of Education and Skills training schemes. We have made funds available for young entrepreneurs via the micro-finance scheme. In total, the specific provisions across these headings in the 2014 budget come to €46 million.

That is in addition to the remaining 58,000 places which are available across the various initiatives we are taking. At the end of the day, the provision of places in training, work experience and education is about preparing young people to go to work. Ultimately, what is required is the generation of real jobs with good incomes and futures. That is why we are also succeeding on that front with an additional 3,000 jobs being created every month. I was at the opening of a company providing 100 of those jobs yesterday in the Dublin Docklands. The company has an online recruitment service and already employs 100 young people here, but it will employ an additional 100 people. We need more of that and are seeing more of that. As far as the Government is concerned, there is nothing more important than the creation of employment and in particular the creation of job opportunities for young people. That is why the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection are in Paris today to discuss this issue at a meeting convened by President Hollande.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	He did not answer my question. If the Tánaiste is as serious about youth unemployment as he says he is, then why does the 2014 action plan for jobs not include youth unemployment? Why has the Government not tackled youth emigration as a priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency the Tánaiste claimed that the Youth Guarantee scheme was one of his big ideas. Yet in the budget a miserable €14 million was put into that scheme, while it sliced €32 million from young people's income support. That is a net loss of €18 million. The Taoiseach and Minister for Social Protection can pirouette around Paris to their heart's content but the fact is that the Youth Guarantee scheme is falling apart. Will the Tánaiste acknowledge that it will not bring forward the promised upskilling or the provision of employment and education opportunities for young people? If it is a priority, why is it not in the Government's jobs plan for 2014?

Many young people are employed in new types of employment being attracted into this country, including in the Dublin Docklands and in companies like PayPal in Deputy Adams' constituency. The Deputy should go and talk to those people and to others who are being employed. Many of the jobs being created in the new economy are jobs that, happily, are being taken up by young people. This is the reason the proportion of young people between 20 and 24 years of age in employment increased from 45.5% in the first half of 2012 to 47.6% in the first half of this year. This was the first increase in six years in this cohort of people taking up employment. That said, we have a lot more to do. As I said earlier, approximately 59,000 of the people out of the workforce are under 25. We must get these people jobs or provide them with training or work experience.

There is huge concern, frustration and anger at the Grid25 proposal across the Munster counties of Cork, Tipperary, Waterford and the Leinster counties of Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Kildare. Thousands of people have turned out at public meetings. I congratulate the various action groups involved and thank the legendary Sean Kelly for his leadership on this issue. This is an intolerable proposal, which is and will be resisted. Everybody accepts that this country must have top quality electrical infrastructure. What is at issue is the manner of the delivery of that infrastructure and the proposal in this regard, namely, the erection of 750 monster pylons along a 250 km route. These pylons will be 45 metres high, ten times the height of the average bungalow, and will be erected at 330 metre intervals. EirGrid has stated that where possible these pylons will be located 50 metres from houses. Residents along the route will have to live with these pylons 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year for the remainder of their lives.  This infrastructure will blight the landscape for locals and visitors alike and will destroy our tourism industry. Some of the most scenic areas in my constituency of south Tipperary are affected, including the Galtee Knockmealdown Valley, the heritage town of Cahir, the Golden Vale into Clonmel, the Valley of Slievenamon, the Suir Valley into Faugheen and Carrick-on-Suir and on into Waterford and the Comeragh Mountains and its special areas of conservation and habitats. EirGrid is involved in a divide and conquer of residents along these routes, setting them against one another. It is setting neighbours against one another by offering compensation to some and not to others who are equally or more affected. Devaluation of properties and significant health issues are other reasons for opposing this project.  Best international practice is that these high voltage power lines must be laid underground and-or under sea.

This is obviously technically possible and financially feasible. The closing date for submissions to EirGrid on this proposal is 26 November.

Grid25 is EirGrid's plan to develop and upgrade the electricity transmissions network. This project will take several years to complete and represents an investment of €3.2 billion. It involves extensive work throughout the country, including the construction of 800 km of new power lines and the upgrade of 2,000 km of existing lines, which, in effect, will double the size of the current grid. The North-South transmission is a critical piece of infrastructure. Its absence is currently costing economies and consumers up to €30 million per annum. Without it, the system is more inefficient. The Government has made it a priority to retain the networks in State ownership as a strategic infrastructure and to ensure that they are developed and maintained in the interests of Irish citizens and consumers. It is also Government policy that infrastructure investment programmes are delivered in the most cost-efficient and timely way possible on the basis of best available knowledge and informed engagement of the impacts and costs of different engineering solutions. Public acceptance and understanding of the need for new infrastructure is critical. A key part of developing this public confidence is that EirGrid should adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health, environmental and visual impact and technology choice. The planning process provides the framework for ensuring that necessary standards are met and provides in law and on a non-statutory basis that consultation with the public be built into that process. EirGrid must adhere to national and international standards on health, environment, biodiversity, landscape and safety as an intrinsic part of the environmental impact assessment and planning process. It is required to use the best available advice and expertise and to address and mitigate any human, environmental or landscape impact in delivering the best possible engineering solutions for our small and still isolated electricity system. The Government does not have a role in directing EirGrid to particular sites, routes or technologies. This is a matter for EirGrid and the forward planning process.

The only consultation, if consultation there is, is in relation to overhead power lines. EirGrid is not prepared to consult on the issue of placing these power lines underground or under sea, which, as I said earlier, is already best international practice in this regard. There are significant health issues involved. National and international agencies have pointed to very serious doubts in relation to these overhead power lines. For example, the Irish expert report on the issue published in 2007 states that there is limited scientific evidence of an association between ELF magnetic fields and childhood leukemia and, that while this does not mean ELF magnetic fields cause cancer, that possibility cannot be excluded.

In view of the fact that EirGrid cannot guarantee that there are no health issues involved in this, and in view of the fact that national and international studies raise serious doubts and health issues about these overhead lines, will the Government institute the precautionary principle? That principle has been adopted by the EU and the World Health Organization. Will the Government ensure that the EirGrid proposal to erect overhead high voltage power lines is cancelled and the transmission takes place through shielded lines underground and undersea, in accordance with best international practice?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	The issue of whether the lines should be overground or underground arose previously in the case of power lines between Meath and Tyrone. In line with the commitment we gave in the programme for Government, on 5 July 2011, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced an international commission of experts to review and report within six months on the cost of and case for putting underground all or part of the Meath-Tyrone 400 kV power line. After considering the merits of overhead and underground options, the report notes that there is no single right solution and that technical solutions must be project specific. The report did not recommend any particular technical option, but it did recommend against putting an alternating current cable wholly underground. It provided its expert views on the feasible technology options available for consideration for the Meath-Tyrone project, including high voltage direct current technology, given the changes in technology suppliers and costs in recent years. In that context, the commission estimated that the cost of implementing the project as a HVDC underground cable option would be three times the cost of the traditional overhead line option, while noting that cost estimates are always uncertain. A number of national and international health and scientific agencies have reviewed more than 30 years of research into electromagnetic fields, and none of these agencies has concluded that exposure to EMF from overhead power lines is a cause for long-term adverse effects. In October 2005, the World Health Organization convened an international expert panel to review the scientific literature on the biological effects of exposure to extremely low frequency fields. In March 2007, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources assembled a panel of independent scientists to review EMF and radio frequency research. The position was restated again by the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser in a report into possible health effects of exposure to electric and magnetic fields in July 2010. There is a quite a degree of both national and international reviews of the likely health effects, none of which reaches the conclusions Deputy Healy has put on record.

The programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for Oireachtas reform to be introduced in a phased process over the lifetime of this Government. No parliament is perfect and the process of parliamentary reform is always ongoing. The reforms introduced since this Government took office in March 2011, together with the reforms introduced last week, will improve the working of the Oireachtas, but they are not the end of the reform process. Work has started on the next phase of Dáil reform. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and I have met the Opposition leaders and Whips to discuss what should be included in the next phase of Oireachtas reform. The first phase of the Dáil reform was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included an additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, to be taken by the Tánaiste; Topical Issue debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment debates; Friday sittings for Deputies to introduce their own Bills; an appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is unhappy with the reply received to a parliamentary question; as well as a restructuring of the Oireachtas committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas committees from 25 to 16 and providing a system of pre-legislative review. In the summer of 2012, further reforms to the Oireachtas committee system were introduced, which streamlined the structure and allowed additional focus on areas such as jobs and agriculture. The Dáil reform sub-committee met on a number of occasions in 2012 and 2013 to discuss Dáil reform proposals. In September 2013, the Government announced the second phase of the Dáil reform programme. In October 2013 the Dáil debated changes to Standing Orders and the new changes were introduced last week. More public involvement in the law-making process will be achieved as follows. A pre-legislative stage before an Oireachtas committee will be a requirement for all non-emergency legislation. A Minister who does not bring a Bill to committee for pre-legislative stage will be required to explain that decision to the Dáil. The pre-legislative stage will allow for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law-making. The committee can consult experts and civic society. Crucially, this will take place before the legislation is drafted. Where there has been a pre-legislative stage, the chair, vice chair or a member of the relevant committee will have a right equal to that of the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons to speak in the Dáil to outline the committee's work. In addition, the Government’s priorities will be outlined to the Dáil on an annual basis as follows. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste will address the Dáil setting out the Government's annual priorities. Each Minister will also address the Dáil setting out his or her Department’s plans for the future. The Government will publish for debate in the Dáil an economic update and projections for the next three years, using the stability programme and national reform programme; a national risk assessment, which will set out the risks, both financial and non-financial, which the country faces in the year ahead; and a national progress report, produced independently by the CSO. The role of Oireachtas committees in the budget process will be expanded as follows. In April each year the stability programme update is presented by the Government to the EU. Committees will be able to review this information and report before the budget in October. The budget and spending Estimates will be published in October and committees will, for the first time, scrutinise the budget proposals and the Estimates before the beginning of the financial year and before any money is spent. A new, improved model of financial scrutiny, which was piloted for five Departments in 2013, will be rolled out to all Departments by 2015. We are introducing a number of measures to improve the legislative process, including the following. A new system for the drafting and enactment of legislation will include a reduction in the number of legislative programmes to two per year. The Dáil sitting day will be longer, starting at 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday and Thursday, and the increase in time available will be used to debate legislation. These steps will result in a reduction in the use of the guillotine. Legislative debate in the Chamber will be improved by the following reforms. On First Stage the proposer of a Private Member’s Bill will have five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill. On Second Stage the chair or vice chair of the committee which considered the Bill at pre-legislative stage will have a speaking slot to report to the Dáil on its findings. At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes will be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies chosen by the Ceann Comhairle at random who had previously spoken on the Bill. Changes to Friday sittings will include the following: the Dáil will sit every second Friday to debate a Private Members' Bill and committee reports. This will allow more Deputies to have their Bills debated in the Dáil and allow Oireachtas committee reports to be debated in the Dáil. Private Members' Bills and committee reports will be selected using a lottery system. A Minister or Minister of State will speak during the debate to outline the Government’s response. Reforms to the system for topical issues include the following: the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department will reply to topical issue debates. If this is not the case, the Deputy can ask to have the matter deferred until a Minister from that Department is available, when it will be given priority. Changes to parliamentary questions include the following: an ordinary oral question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the question is in the Chamber when it is reached. The Deputy will be given a brief period of 30 seconds, to outline the question. An Opposition spokesperson will no longer be able to nominate questions in the name of other Deputies, but can submit five ordinary questions.  A new system of post-legislative review will be introduced as follows: a Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas committee within 12 months of enactment of an Act to review the functioning of the Act. The number of Dáil sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of the Dáil recesses and introducing additional sitting days. A comparison of sitting days between this Government’s first two and a half years in office, when the Dáil sat 303 days, and the first two and a half years in office of the previous Fianna Fáil, Green and Progressive Democrats coalition, when the Dáil sat 229 days, shows an increase of 74 sitting days or 32.3%. No Cabinet sub-committee on political reform has been established. The establishment of Cabinet committees is a matter for Government and the need for further Cabinet committees is kept under review. Work has started on the next phase of Dáil reform. As I have already said, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government Whips have met with the Opposition party leaders and Whips to discuss the next phase of Dáil reform. The Dáil reform sub-committee, discussions with Opposition party leaders and Whips and consultation with all Deputies will all form part of developing the next set of Dáil reforms.

I welcome the fact that the Minister of State mentioned consultation. These changes are often a fait accompli, and by the time a decision reaches the Members the Government has already decided to go ahead with a particular proposal leaving us to row in behind it or suck it up. Does the Minister of State agree that there needs to be proper consultation as in a list of proposed changes circulated to all Members, not just those within political parties to allow them make some kind of input? Even if the Dáil reform committee does not agree with them Members will at least have had some say because the changes brought into this Chamber affect every Member of the House. They also significantly affect the staff who do not have a say in the matter in any shape or form. Can we ensure that there is proper consultation at an early stage rather than after the fact or when a full proposal is already on the table? Does the Minister of State agreed that there is a conflict between the number of sitting days and the hours that we sit? He mentioned that we have sat an extra 32.3% days since whenever, but that does not necessarily equate to hours worked or productivity. There is also an argument about the two roles that Deputies play, first as messengers from their constituents who elected them, and second as legislators. The roles are intertwined but are often at odds. The trend seems to be that the days of the week when the Dáil does not sit are being eaten into by extending sittings to Friday and including sittings on a Monday which squeezes the other half of the work of Deputies. That impacts not only on the ability of Deputies to do that work but also on their personal life. A balance needs to be struck. The more we move towards full Friday and Monday sittings the greater the impact. I have several practical proposals which I do not believe require the endorsement of the Dáil reform committee but if that is necessary then so be it. One is a simple change, to ensure that the headphones in this Chamber are discreet. If I speak as Gaeilge people do not put on the headphones because to do so would embarrass them by announcing to the world that they do not know Irish. The introduction of discreet headphones would be a simple change and does not require approval by a committee. Another simple change would be to install an abstain button. If one does not vote for or against a proposal one declares that one is not here. There are occasions when Opposition Members wish to abstain. I have not seen Government Members caught in that bind. I have been making this proposal for several years but because it does not fall under the scope of changes to Standing Orders it falls by the wayside. Simultaneous publication of the explanatory memorandum of a Bill in Irish would provide the terminology associated with the Bill. The Minister for Social Protection said that it would happen or that at the very least she would consider it. I have argued for years that Bills should be published simultaneously in English and in Irish but it would be a step forward if the explanatory memorandum at the very least were published in Irish. Will the Minister of State consider that proposal? I have submitted a detailed list of my Dáil reform proposals. I do not suggest that they are the be-all and end-all but I will argue the case in each one. Will it be possible in the future to have enough time between Government proposals and their implementation to consider their practicalities because in the case of some recent proposals the practicalities and the timeframe for implementation left a lot to be desired? I will leave it at that but I might come back in at a later stage when other Deputies have finished their contributions.

For the nine years that I was Opposition Whip there was lots of consultation but there was no Dáil reform. The Dáil reform committee sat and talked but there was never any action or any decisions taken. It is possible to have lots of consultation but I believe we must also have action and results. One of the first things I did when I became Government Chief Whip was to hold a debate on Dáil reform. That gave an opportunity to every Member of the House to speak. It would be no harm to repeat that process because there were many new Deputies who had been in the House only a month at that stage and who perhaps did not understand the workings of the standing orders of the House, the debates and votes and so on. Now that Members, particularly new Members, have settled in and know and understand the workings of the House we could have another debate. My parliamentary party has had several debates on Dáil reform.We had one specific meeting recently before I implemented the changes. That is going back two or three weeks but we had a debate at our parliamentary party meeting. It is up to each party or grouping to have their own debates at their parliamentary party meetings. I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for his proposals and I thank Deputy Ó Feargháil from Fianna Fáil for his. They gave me two reports as well as actions they are keen to see with regard to Dáil reform. I pledge to have a debate in the House before any future reforms. This will give other Members, especially new Members who now understand the workings of the House, an opportunity to outline what changes they might want. Deputy Ó Snodaigh made reference to extra sitting days. People say we should be family friendly and so on. I see nothing family friendly in a Deputy having to come from west Cork, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry or Limerick, all of which are three or four hours from Leinster House, on a Monday and then sitting from nine to five on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and perhaps Thursdays. In that case they are away from their families for three or four days and that is not very family friendly, and nor is it family friendly for Members in Dublin to start off at 9 a.m. and sit until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. It is difficult for them to get back to their families. It is difficult to balance the requests. I was in the Scottish Parliament recently. Business works there from nine to five with committees sitting in the forenoon and parliamentary work and debates in the parliament in the afternoon. It is difficult to balance it and to make everyone happy. It is not the case that everyone will be happy with the sitting hours in the House. However, it is important to try to do our work on the legislative process on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays in so far as it is possible. Anyone who wishes can then introduce Private Members' Bills or committee reports to be debated on Fridays. Deputy Ó Snodaigh is correct that we are messengers of the people. It is important that Members spend time in their constituencies listening to the problems and the voices of the people because this impacts a great deal on our work in the House. Deputy Ó Snodaigh has seen as much himself, especially with the television programme he took part in some weeks ago. It was an excellent programme and I compliment RTE. The programme gave the public an insight into the daily workings of a Member of the Oireachtas. A number of people remarked on the programme to me. It is not only about national legislation. There are also a vast number of queries, such as a person's medical card or various other issues, to be addressed and it is important to give Members an opportunity to do so. We should allow Members time because there are considerable impacts on their lives when they are Members of the House. I will take up the matter of headphones with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges if Deputy Ó Snodaigh writes to the committee. I will take his remarks on board. I strongly believe that if persons do not agree either way on legislation and wish to abstain, there should be a rollcall on those who abstain. However, these Members should be in the Chamber at the same time and should present themselves to the Clerk or the Ceann Comhairle. I am unsure whether it is possible to have an abstention button but it is something we could explore further. I was unaware of the problem with regard to publishing Bills; I thought Bills were published in Irish. That is something new I have learned today. I am aware that semi-State bodies must publish all reports in Irish. I had thought that, if requested, a person could get a copy of a Bill in Irish. I realise it is an extra financial burden on the Houses of the Oireachtas and we should bear that in mind when making any decision on publishing Bills in Irish.

They succeeded in giving the public a useful insight into the work of a parliamentarian. While it may not have been all positive in terms of how the public viewed it, it was realistic and generally helpful. A Cheann Comhairle, you are to be complimented on the fact that you brought the RTE cameras into the House earlier in the year and gave the public throughout the country, many of whom have never visited Leinster House, the Dáil or the Seanad, an opportunity to see the House in all its glory and to build some understanding of how the place works. That was very positive. Reference has been made to Dáil reform and the work of the Whips. When I was re-elected to the House and appointed Whip by my leader, I joined the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, Deputy Catherine Murphy and others in the task. There was a certain sense of enthusiasm on the part of all of us about our ability to do something. I had a sense that for the first time a group of people were working together who would get their teeth into the whole area of reform and do something about it. I have been disappointed with the outcome not because of any shortcomings on the part of any of the individuals, but because I believe the Government Chief Whip has found himself having to report back to Government. Whereas the Government Chief Whip may have been willing to try new ideas and go down new avenues, the Government has been inordinately conservative in how it has approached the whole area of reform. Its reform agenda is obviously particularly limited. The Government Chief Whip made reference to the difficulties he had in his previous nine years in the House. There were many talks about reform during that period and there was in fact some meaningful reform. During that period Leaders' Questions were introduced for the first time and that in itself has been a substantial reform giving as it does the opportunity for party leaders to question the Taoiseach. I am also given to understand that one of the impediments to achieving overall agreement during the course of those years was a major reluctance on the part of the Labour Party to enter into agreement on the type of reforms discussed. Whatever about that, the reality is that when the Government was elected it referred to a democratic revolution. What we have gotten so far is far from that and all the indications are that what we are going to see is minimal tokenistic change and change that is being presented to the media as of far greater significance than it is in reality. The Government Chief Whip has done a fine job with the Topical Issue debate. It worked well initially, but then it began to go into decline when Ministers ceased to make themselves available. Since the matter was highlighted before the summer break, we have seen an improvement. I hope that improvement continues and I hope we continue to get meaningful responses from Ministers. The question of committees was raised. The Government reduced the number of committees when it was elected but total control rests with the Government to appoint the chairpersons. If I am not mistaken, only two Members of the Opposition are chairs of Oireachtas committees and neither of them chairs a legislative committee. The Government Chief Whip and the Taoiseach have adverted to a package of reforms. They have said they are going to use the d'Hondt system for the appointment of chairs in future. That is all very well but it really is a case of "God make me pure, but just not yet". We will have to wait until the next Dáil for that significant change and God knows which of us will be here, if any, when that eventuality takes place. The Government published an eight-page document on Dáil reform last September. While elements of that reform obviously had been discussed by the Dáil reform committee, the Taoiseach gave specific undertakings to the leader of my party, Deputy Martin, and to the leader of Sinn Féin, Deputy Adams, to engage with them on that matter. However, such engagement never happened. Thereafter, a meeting was held in the run-up to the Seanad referendum and while I do not consider myself to be a particularly cynical person, it would be hard not to be cynical and not to regard that meeting as a box-ticking exercise that was carried out simply and solely to be able to assert that the Government maintained its commitment to reform, had met the Opposition and everything was hunky-dory. However, an alarming feature of that meeting was that the Taoiseach told those present that none of the reforms that had been discussed with the Opposition leaders were going to change. Anything the leaders had to say about future reform would be welcome and could be considered in the future but this did not apply to the current package of reforms. Consequently, our scepticism about the process that is in hand is understandable. Deputies have referred to the Friday sittings and considerable credit is due to those who have initiated the Friday sittings. It is a highly positive development whereby backbench Members, the bulk of us, can produce Bills and can introduce them into the House. However, for this to be truly meaningful some of that legislation and some of those Bills must find their way into law. The Government must agree that at least someone on the Opposition has had a good idea, even if by accident, and has come up with a good proposal the Government is willing to take on board. To date, that has not happened and I believe I am correct in stating that not a solitary legislative item that has been discussed on Friday in this Chamber has as yet found its way into law. Moreover, I dare suggest there is considerable likelihood that few if any of those proposals will become firm items of Irish legislation between now and the end of the term of this Government. If that is the case, then Members are involved in nothing more than a process of self-delusion. They are coming into the Chamber to discuss proposals and are telling the people they are great because they are present for two Fridays each month and have increased their sittings accordingly. However, what is the point of it all, if ultimately, the legislation discussed is not enacted, not put into force and not given the effect of changing and improving the lives of the people? I suggest there is a correlation between the sittings of this House, their duration, as well as Friday sittings and Members' capacity to make this House and a career therein something that is attractive to younger people and to women in particular. In the course of the debates that took place at the Constitutional Convention, I was struck forcibly by the public perception of this House, of politics and by the reasons one hears that people do not wish to become involved in politics. They perceive, among other things, the type of life involved to be anti-family and anti-marriage. Moreover, for both men and women - it is important to stress this is a matter for men just as much as for women - the type of lifestyle Members have is perceived to be not conducive to raising a family and spending the time one should spend with one's children. This is something that also should be taken into account as it affects the Friday sittings and the time of sittings. As for being in the Chamber until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., as was the case during the last term, apart from such practices clearly not being family-friendly, how, for the love of God, could one be effective in dealing with legislation if one finds oneself in such a predicament on any sort of a regular basis? Finally, Deputy Ó Snodaigh has raised a simple but valid point. From time to time, legislation or motions will come before the House and for whatever reason, Members will come to the conclusion they should abstain on such legislation. All Members are now subject to analysis by the media in all shapes, including social media and whatever, but when one abstains there is no record of this. Consequently, a Member with a number of conscientious abstentions finds his or her participation in the process, such as it is by way of abstention, is not recorded. As a matter of principle, some methodology must be found to record those who do so. A system already is in place that records those who vote in favour or against a measure but it is reasonable to suggest, as has Deputy Ó Snodaigh, that some form of registration of abstention should be found. I offer those few thoughts and would appreciate the opportunity later on to revert, if time allows.

However, the Deputy mentioned the Ceann Comhairle allowing RTE's cameras into the Dáil Chamber to facilitate the "Nationwide" programme that is broadcast after the news at 6 p.m. It was highly effective and worthwhile because it is an honour for any visitor to come into the Dáil. If one considers the number of schoolchildren who do so, both primary and secondary, only a small percentage of the total number of schoolchildren nationwide have the honour of visiting this Chamber. If they are not going to come to the Parliament, Members must bring the Parliament to them. Moreover, it should not only be about the Parliament but more programmes similar to RTE's "Looking After No.1", should be televised. I agree with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that there is an undoubted willingness on the part of all the Whips to bring in and to implement change. It is the Government's job to make such change happen and I understand the Deputy might bring forward proposals which Fianna Fáil would not have brought forward when it was in government. It is understandable that its members might wish to bring forward such changes while in opposition. The Government parties would have done the same thing when they were on the benches opposite and they would not have got their way. However, there is give and take on all this debate and on bringing in changes, reforms and so on. I do not wish to be negative about the changes, as one should also be positive about some of the reforms the Government has introduced. They include additional Leaders' Questions, the Topical Issue debate, the Friday sittings, the instruction of Members to enable them to introduce their own Bills, the restructuring of the Oireachtas committees and the new pre-legislative stage. Moreover, this year a number of reforms were introduced in recent weeks. Therefore, quite a number of reforms have been effected if one compares the reforms that have been introduced within a very short time with the preceding 15 years and one should not be completely negative. The Deputy observed the Government had promised a democratic revolution but when one refers to such a revolution, it is not simply about what happens here in the Dáil. There have been a great number of changes and while I am unsure whether the Deputy is a member of the Constitutional Convention, it is a part of that democratic revolution.The Deputy said it was refreshing to listen to some of the contributions made at the Constitutional Convention. The number of referendums that are due to be held in the coming period are part of a democratic revolution and part of the change in that respect. I would have been critical of the Constitutional Convention when the idea was first mentioned but I have changed my mind about it. A great number of issues would not have seen the light of day were it not for the Constitutional Convention. Therefore, it must be welcomed. Some of the issues that are brought forward can be a political hot potato but people are being given an opportunity to have their say on them in terms of a referendum. That has been happened as a result of the Constitutional Convention and that is part of the democratic revolution. It will not be possible to change everything in a short period. We are in office two and a half years and we have made a stab at bringing in a fair number of changes inside and outside this House. The Deputy spoke about the Topical Issue debate. The only issue Members have raised with me about that debate is that not enough Topical Issue matters are selected each day. They would like more of them selected. They have told me that they have submitted a request to the Ceann Comhairle on three or four occasions and he has not granted their request, but he has a difficult job to do. I do not know the number of requests, on average, the Ceann Comhairle would get each week but he has a number in terms of the requests he can select. He must try to accommodate everybody and be mindful not to select all the issues from Members on this side of this House, or from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Sinn Féin Party or from four Independent Members on the one day because he would ridiculed if he were to do that. He tries to share the requests selected among the groupings to the best of his ability, and that is a difficult job to do. I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on the way the business is being run. It is extremely positive and it has been successful. Also, the debate takes place during the heart of the Dáil day. The Minister or the Minister of State from the relevant Department must be present in the Chamber to listen to the backbencher's contribution, and that is important. The Deputy mentioned those chairing committees. I remind him that he was a member of previous Government when there were 26 committees. No member of the Opposition chaired any of the sectoral committees and nothing has changed in that respect. The only thing that has changed-----

We will do that and we have outlined that. That will be a sea change compared with what has happened in past where €20,000 was paid to 26 Members who were chairmen of committees. I remember there was only one member of Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's party from 2007 to 2011 who did not have an extra paid position. I will not name the Deputy but I felt sorry for him and wondered what he did on the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern not to get a paid position. There was only one such member. The Deputy should check up on that. The Taoiseach promised that before any future reforms are brought forward, we will meet the party leaders, receive submissions from the Sinn Féin Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, examine those and bring forward as many of them as possible. I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that the Friday sittings have been successful. What must ensure some of the Bills that have been accepted are moved further along the legislative chain and incorporated into Bills and brought to the House in terms of enactment. An important development is the consideration of committee reports, and we dealt with the first such report last Friday. The committees do a great deal of work in compiling reports, having brought in representatives of groups and organisations, namely, those with vested interests in an issue, and having often spent money on having people draft a report, although a number of them have been compiled in-house. It is important that those reports are seen to be debated on the floor of Dáil Éireann. It is opportune to have them debated on a Friday bearing in mind the legislation that has to be debated in the House on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and that we will try to reduce the number of guillotines applied. On the Deputy's point regarding family friendly sitting hours and getting the right balance, I do not think there is any parliament in the world that has the right balance in terms of family friendly hours. We have to take into account the Members who travel from constituencies as far away as Limerick, Kerry, Donegal or Mayo. It is not as simple as getting into a car at 8 o'clock in the morning and being outside the gates of Leinster House at 9 a.m. or 9.30 p.m. or leaving here at 5 o'clock in the evening and being home with one's family at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock. That does not happen and that is not going to happen, but we have to take into account that Members are here, that we sit for as long as is appropriate and look after the Members who go home to their constituencies on a daily basis. I do not believe some of the Dublin Members realise the hours rural Members spend away from their families. Some Members travel to Dublin on a Monday evening or leave home at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock on a Tuesday morning and do not get home until very late on a Thursday night, they meet their constituents on a Friday morning and may not be home until late on Friday night and, on occasions, they work on Saturday and Sunday. I do not believe that the Members who live near the Dáil realise the sacrifices a great number of rural Deputies make to work in the Oireachtas and keep their Dáil and constituency commitments. The Deputy raised the issue of a Member who wishes to abstain from a vote having an opportunity to press a button indicating they are present in the Chamber but abstaining. That is a matter we can take up with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I do not have a problem with it. We should definitely consider that proposal when we are considering future reforms.

It is very fair that the Dáil should be organised to recognise that. On the other side, sometimes rural colleagues do not understand the way Dublin Deputies and those who live close to Dublin are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Meetings will be scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, 5 p.m. on a Thursday and so on. We have the issue that we are always accessible. I accept the amazing incredible journeys rural Deputies make and the hardship on their families is something of which the House must always be cognisant. I believe the decision of the people not to vote "Yes" for the abolition of the Seanad was regrettable. Its abolition would have focused attention on the reform of this House and making it much more effective. The Ceann Comhairle is an experienced Member of the House. I often wonder if it is possible to have a very democratic Dáil while the Executive is in the House. We can look to other parliaments such as France and the United States where the executive is outside the parliament. In some respects, that type of parliamentary system has advantages over the old Westminster system to which we have adhered since Independence. I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on Standing Orders relative to public business of 5 November last and on some of the new practices introduced in the Dáil including, as the Minister of State mentioned, the Topical Issue debate, the new arrangement for parliamentary questions and his work in trying to ensure Deputies get responses to their parliamentary questions. I echo colleagues' views that a good deal of what has happened in the past two and a half years are fairly minor adjustments. We still have a situation, and the Minister of State has admitted, where important Bills, as in the case of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill recently, are just rammed through the House with minimum debate and a minimum attempt to elucidate the views of the Opposition Members. The d'Hondt system could be a huge step forward in electing committee chairmen following the next election, but who will be in power? It may not be the Government parties. The powers of the Ceann Comhairle should be strengthened and enhanced. The House is constrained during Friday sittings from making its own decisions and clearly the Ceann Comhairle and Members who are present should be in charge of what is happening under amended Standing Orders. With regard to the independence of the Ceann Comhairle, perhaps we should follow the House of Commons precisely and provide for a free vote for election to the office when a Dáil assembles. I refer to the position of the Other Group of Members, particularly Deputies Shortall, Nulty, Keaveney and myself - the social democratic group of the "Others". There are one or two others from the "Others" present who may be social democrats and who are members of the reform alliance.

The Tánaiste has said on a number of occasions that we can attend committee meetings but if we want to take a real part in the committee, we must be voting members. That is denied to us. We are also denied time during priority questions. We must until all the other groups' questions have been taken. We cannot table priority questions and we cannot ask Leaders' Questions. Given the calibre of some of the "Others", we would have a beefed up and spruced up Leaders' Questions debate if a voice from our benches could raise issues directly with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. If this was a seriously reformed Dáil, provision would be made for this large group of Members who are outside the current party or group structure. I welcome the comments on the budget and Estimates debates. It has been a farce for a number of decades. We used to discuss the Estimates for a budget that had been announced eight or nine months previously, which was ludicrous. In other parliaments such as the Dutch Parliament, all members or groups are involved in discussion and have an input before a Minister comes forward with an outline budget. We are a long way from that, particularly this year because of the two-pack. What will Europe and the Bundestag say about our budget? Will the Bundestag be happy with next year's budget? Would we have even had the changes that were made this year to the budgetary process if we did not have the two-pack? I support my colleague regarding the abstain button. I have abstained once or twice when I could not vote in favour of something and that should be logged. With regard to the earlier sitting times, I appreciate what the Minister of State said. We appreciate the work rural Members do and the life they have but perhaps the late sittings, even until 9 p.m., could be examined given that many Members living within a reasonable radius of Dublin have the opportunity to return to their families at night. I agree with the Minister of State that he must strike the correct balance in order that every Member has a proper opportunity. We must also return to the issue of holding effective Oireachtas inquiries. I look forward to the banking inquiry getting under way so many years after all this damage was done to our country perhaps under the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform but we need to revisit the referendum on the Abbeylara judgment because a small group of legal and corporate vested interests mounted a vicious campaign when the country was otherwise engaged to defeat the will of the people and the House, which was to thoroughly investigate major scandals and issues of the day.

It was a commitment in the programme for Government. I respect the democratic decision of the people and the Taoiseach outlined to the Seanad the week before last that he will bring forward proposals regarding the House in consultation with the Leader and all other Members of the House. I take the Deputy's points on the Topical Issue debate, the d'Hondt system and the Friday sittings. Fridays are working well but after a Member introduces a Bill, each political party or group spokesperson should then outline his or her position. That should be the form of the debate. If, for example, Deputy Ó Fearghaíl introduced a Bill, I would not like to respond immediately as a backbencher. I would like to hear the position of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin, the Technical Group and Independent Members before I partake in the debate.

I would love to be a fly on the wall when he is selecting a leader for his party. The issue regarding Leaders' Questions will form part of future reforms. I will take on board any ideas he has. I do not say they will be implemented but I am open to discussion on them. I take his point regarding financial scrutiny, an area in which the House has been found lacking over recent years. Each committee will have an opportunity under the most recent reforms to scrutinise the financial matters relating to the sector over which it has oversight. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and all other Ministers will have to outline to the House their financial and social policy issues once a year. This will give the committees and Members an opportunity to examine the national reform and stability programmes we submit to the EU annually. Members will also have an opportunity to debate the Estimates around budget time. We have fallen behind in this regard during this Dáil. Perhaps we can blame the financial circumstances in which we found ourselves because there was not enough scrutiny by all Members. The Deputy also referred to Oireachtas inquiries. We gave the people an opportunity in a referendum a number of years ago to strengthen the inquires powers of the House.I take on board the decision of the people but I regret that decision. We could have had far stronger committees and inquiries if that referendum had been passed. The banking inquiry is coming up and I can assure the Deputy that it will be given the full backing of the Oireachtas and I have met Oireachtas staff in regard to it. It will be given every resource required to ensure we have a meaningful banking inquiry run by the Oireachtas.

There is a kind of inverse relationship between the length of time one has been here and the amount of time one speaks which would indicate that the longer one is here, the more one realises speaking in the Chamber is futile. In fairness to him, Deputy Durkan is probably one of the honourable exceptions. The Minister of State touched on a very important point. He mentioned that in the last Dáil, the Government, with the exception of one member, was on an allowance. Some 50% or so of the Opposition were on allowances. This gives rise to one of the great corrupting forces in our political system, namely, the concept of patronage. Every Member of this House and the Seanad should be on a similar wage. Perhaps there should be a small ministerial allowance but there should be wage parity because that would stop patronage, whether one is in government or in opposition. Clearly, it has been a reason for patronage and corruption of a sort in the past. In regard to the Dáil, there are two fundamental issues when we strip everything away. One issue is the position of the Ceann Comhairle. We are fortunate the Ceann Comhairle has an independent and strong voice. I do not say that lightly and I do not seek to patronise him with those comments but it is true and I think it is acknowledged across the House. However, it is important that from here on in we elect the Ceann Comhairle, that it is an independently elected person who has responsibility for the administration of the House and offices so that everybody has confidence in the Ceann Comhairle. That needs to be done.  I refer to the second thing that needs to change. I am not targeting the Minister of State or any of the Chief Whips over the past years but unless the mindset of Government changes, we will not have change in this House. I am neither a Government nor an Opposition Member - I am in a twilight zone - so I think I can look upon this in a fairly neutral manner. Prior to the last general election, a commitment was given that all important announcements would be made in the House. I do not know how many announcements there have been on job creation and I know the Tánaiste attended many of them. Virtually every one of them was made outside this House. We started a debate on jobs and job creation in this House and it is still on the Order Paper as it has not been completed. I acknowledge it is in the Government's interest to down-play the importance of the House and that is why the mindset must change. I will give the House a classic example. By and large, I support the Finance Bill but there was no lead-in to it. The debate on Second Stage of the Bill will finish tonight but I will not have the opportunity to speak on it, notwithstanding the fact the others have been facilitated with some time. Will the Government try to comply with the spirit of the direction issued by the Ceann Comhairle in respect of the allocation of time because it has not been complied with?  Somebody brought up the issue of a button where one can abstain from a vote because of a concern about the analysis of the Oireachtas. What about a button for those who want to speak on measures but who cannot do so? Can we have some way to facilitate that because there are many Members who would like to speak on measures? The most important legislation will go through tonight but many Members will not be able to speak on it. Will the Minister of State take those messages to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste? Reference was made to the Seanad referendum held five or six weeks ago. That had the potential to bring about the most fundamental change to the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State but we have not had a debate on the issue, which is a disgrace.  Will the Minister of State, in conjunction with the other Whips, do something about walk-through votes? They are a reflection on the Opposition more than on the Government and we were guilty of calling for them when in opposition. If the public saw what we do when we call for a walk-through vote, they would see it is infantile. Could we cut that out? I do not know the purpose of a walk-through vote.

Perhaps we can include that in a future debate on Dáil reform. Walk through votes are a matter for the Opposition. I never called one when in opposition. I was always very practical.

The Bill that is currently being considered on Committee Stage does not extend the remit of the freedom of information regime to include the Garda, nor does it include the National Treasury Management Agency, the National Asset Management Agency or the newly formed Irish Water company. Instead, it increases the fees so that it will cost more to get information from the limited areas covered by freedom of information. I am reminded of what the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said about freedom of information when he was in opposition. He stated:Freedom of information is not a service, it is a civil and political right. It is a democratic instrument through which citizens exercise their right to hold the Government to account. Charging an up-front fee for freedom of information requests is like charging an up-front fee to vote in a general election.The Government seems to be ignoring what the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said. It is breaking yet another promise it made to the people. I ask the Tánaiste to resile from that position, to rectify the situation by including in this system the agencies of State that are benefitting from the public purse and to ensure prohibitive costs are not applied.

Approximately 70% of freedom of information requests are made by members of the public who are seeking information on their own files, etc. No charge at all applies to such requests. The amendment mentioned by the Deputy relates to cases in which multiple applications are made in the same letter. It costs approximately €600, on average, to respond to a freedom of information request. That is taxpayers' money. I do not think it is unreasonable for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to propose an amendment to deal with an anomaly or loophole that facilitates those who try to make several unrelated freedom of information requests in the same letter or application. As we consider the Freedom of Information Acts, we must strike a balance between the right to information and the considerable cost to the taxpayer of responding to freedom of information requests. Essentially, we are restoring the position that existed before the Deputy's party pulled apart the freedom of information system.

#PaulConnaughtonJnr	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	352	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter. I understand that before the vote there was a discussion on Dáil reform. One of the issues was that a Topical Issue could be deferred so the Minister is present to reply. I am grateful that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, can attend as I know he was unavoidably absent last Thursday. In recent weeks I have been contacted by a large number of farmers in County Galway and throughout the country who received letters from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine concerning so-called over-claims on their area aid applications. They are incensed that they may be retrospectively billed for past years. These farmers applied on the area of land that appeared on maps supplied by the Department and in some cases on the area of land as measured by the Department's own inspectors following farm inspections. I was contacted by one farmer who had an area aid inspection about five years ago and when he received the new altered maps he believed he had his duty done. However, he found that the new aerial photograph has resulted in him being penalised by another 0.5 of a hectare for the smallest of deductions ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 of a hectare spread out over the farm, including the lawn in front of his house. This farmer is under the 3% penalty clause, or two hectares, but is now dreading another letter in the post in a few weeks demanding payment of whatever the so-called recovery of the single farm payment might be. All the farmers who spoke to me said they only wished to claim on eligible land and if there were some adjustments to be made following the aerial surveillance, they would accept this. However, there should be no retrospection for past years, given that it was the Department's maps which were used in this process. It is important that this message is conveyed to Europe. A strong message should be sent that this is an unfair penalty on farmers who, at all times, were only supplying the information that was supplied to them by the Department. Much of this problem is emanating from Europe and it is at European level that it must be tackled. Individual farmers cannot effect massive change within the system and for that reason I believe the Government must take this issue up at the highest levels in Europe and press for a fair resolution for Irish farmers. Penalising farmers retrospectively for something that is beyond their control, because they placed their faith in the figures supplied by the Department, will simply crush all credibility in the current system and will have a severely negative impact on the attitude of farmers to farm schemes in the future. Another issue which is related to the issue under discussion is the length of time that the review process is taking. For a start, many farmers will not appeal the over-claim as they should, believing they are taking on the might of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I will be urging all farmers to appeal all aspects of the over-claim that they feel are unfair. Second, for those who do appeal, the process is taking far too long. The timeframe for decisions must be made clearer and every effort must be made to ensure that the appeals are processed without delay. In conclusion, I urge the Minister to take up this issue at the highest level in Europe and to make the strongest case possible for the farmers of Ireland, who are being treated in a most unfair way and who fear incurring penalties for something that is beyond their control at a time when they, like all people in the community, are under huge financial pressure.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this issue. It might help to bring clarification to it. Last Thursday, when this was due to be discussed, I was attending another function and could not be present, so my apologies for that. As the House will be aware, my Department carries out a range of inspections on farms under the single payment scheme and other area-related schemes, covering such issues as the eligibility of land and cross compliance. This inspection activity relates to delivery of the significant supports paid to farmers under various EU and nationally funded schemes, as well as ensuring that requirements relating to public and animal health are being met. In carrying out these responsibilities, which must be done to a standard which meets EU audit requirements to protect the draw-down of the significant funding involved, every effort is made to take account of the realities of farming and particularly of the effects of the bad weather experienced in recent years. By way of context, I will restate for the House the significance of the direct payment schemes to the farmers who receive these payments and also to the wider rural and national economy. In annual terms, these payments amount to some €1.7 billion. Under the single farm payment scheme alone, total payments since 2005 have reached almost €10 billion. In terms of the 2013 single payment scheme, over €582 million has already been paid to more than 115,000 farmers. These payments have provided farmers, and will continue to provide them under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, with a stable guaranteed level of income during very challenging economic times and, as such, they underpin the future development of our farming sector, particularly in the context of the ambitious Food Harvest 2020 programme. I will now give the House an overview of the nature of the cross compliance regime. All applicants under the single payment scheme and other area-based schemes are obliged to comply with the requirements of the cross compliance regime. Cross compliance involves two key elements: a requirement for farmers to comply with 18 statutory management requirements, SMRs, set down in EU legislation in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare; a requirement to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition. My Department is required to carry out annual inspections to ensure compliance with the EU regulatory requirements of cross compliance. These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the SMRs and good agricultural environmental condition, GAEC, apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements, while 3% of sheep and-or goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock. It is a recognised principle of the direct aid regime that it serves broader public good objectives and contributes to the maintenance of the rural environment. These inspections are thus necessary to verify that these objectives are being met.In addition, EU regulations governing the cross-compliance regime require relevant competent authorities to cross-report to my Department details of cases where non-compliance with the regulatory requirements is identified as a result of an inspection undertaken by that authority to establish if a penalty should be applied under the single farm payment scheme and other area-based schemes. EU regulations governing the cross-compliance regime prescribe a range of penalties to be applied where non-compliance with the relevant legislative provisions has been identified. Where the non-compliance is due to negligence, the penalty is 3%, which can be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance. Where the non-compliance is determined as intentional, the standard reduction is 20%, but this can be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on extent, severity and permanence. Where a non-compliance is deemed to be minor in nature, tolerance may be applied with the applicant advised to remedy the problem. Where the minor non-compliance is not remedied within a certain period, a penalty of at least 1% is applied. There are also penalty provisions where repeated non-compliance is determined. Inspections under the 2013 single payment scheme are ongoing. Therefore, I am not in a position to identify penalty levels for this scheme year. However, under the 2012 scheme, a total of 2,472 cross-compliance penalties were applied in respect of non-compliances identified as a result of all categories of inspections undertaken by my Department and from cross-reports received therein. The value of these penalties was €2.4 million, equating to 0.2% of the total €1.2 billion paid under the 2012 scheme.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Appropriate appeal mechanisms are in place to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with decisions made in respect of their single farm payment applications. Under this process, a farmer may initially seek to have a cross-compliance penalty decision reviewed internally by a more senior officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can then be appealed to the independent agriculture appeal office and, ultimately, to the Office of the Ombudsman, which brings an entirely external and visibly independent dimension to the process. My Department has also established a farm advisory service operated by Teagasc under the single payment scheme and I recommend that any applicant with cross-compliance inspection or penalty concerns should avail of this service to allay any such concern. In closing, let me emphasise that, in implementing the requirements of the cross-compliance regime, including the required inspection programme, my Department takes the maximum possible account of the realities of farming. Inspecting officers are regularly trained on how to conduct these inspections. Each inspected case will, therefore, have all factors, including poor weather, taken into account when any decision on the outcome of an inspection is reached.

I have no issue with farm inspections. They play a role in the Irish brand and we want to maintain current levels, which farmers understand. More than any other issue, I wish to raise that of payments being sought in respect of 2008 to 2011, inclusive. I understand that a new mapping service is being used, one that is extremely detailed and only became available to the Department this year. Any farmer with whom I have spoken or dealt wants to apply for the eligible land only. That is not an issue. Rather, those farmers have an issue with the retrospective fines that are being applied, given the fact that they used the maps that were available at the time. The information was also supplied by the Department. In terms of audits, I understand that Europe wants to ensure that the money is spent exactly as it is supposed to be and that fines and penalties can arise. However, Europe is being slightly unfair, in that backdating these payments now is difficult when farmers used all of the information available to them at the time to submit their applications for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, or the single farm payment. Will the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have an opportunity within the coming weeks to take a message to Europe to the effect that every Irish farmer wants to stay within the law and only get paid for what he or she is able to do? It is unfair that backdating is being applied to payments when farmers had no hand, act or part in the making of this situation, given that they were only using the Department's information.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	The last thing that the Department or anyone wants to do is be unfair to people. A process is in place whereby, if people are unhappy with the letters being sent by the Department, they can appeal. No one should experience hardship as regards this matter. This is the first point that needs to be clarified. An entire appeals section is available. If cases are causing hardship, either the Minister or I will deal with them individually. It is important to stress the reason for these checks. When we fought a hard battle some months ago in Brussels to protect the single farm payment schemes, Ireland benefited. We should be the first to stand up and assert that we will run the schemes well and efficiently, but we do not want there to be hardships. I guarantee the Deputy that we will do everything we can to be fair to people, but we must live within the rules and regulations if we are to protect the scheme as we go forward.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I welcome the opportunity to raise the question of the financial bonds issued by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, in respect of various building developments, particularly housing estates, throughout the country. Some of the estates in question are unfinished. A difficulty has arisen, in that, as a result of the emergency legislation passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year, IBRC has been put into special liquidation. We are only now learning of the legislation's impact on housing estates that have been left unfinished by developers who have gone to the wall. Developers take out financial bonds to ensure that housing estates can be finished if they go out of business before the job is completed. Many insurance companies issue these bonds. All of the major companies have been involved. Some might have provided loans to developers or underwritten bonds. The difficulty lies in the fact that the bonds issued by the liquidated IBRC are not being paid. Instead, they have been placed at the bottom of the list. Some local authorities face the impossible choice of leaving estates unfinished or taking money from other services to pay for finishing roads, footpaths, drainage, sewerage and street lighting in certain estates. The Minister was aware of this choice when introducing the legislation. I am aware of four housing estates in County Laois that have not been finished. In the normal course of events, the financial bond is called in when a builder is gone. I will cite a practical comparison from a few years ago when Quinn Insurance went into liquidation, that of large estates in County Laois, called Barrowvale and the Vale, in Graiguecullen near the Carlow boundary. Several hundred thousand euro was paid by the administrator on foot of that bond. Now that IBRC is in liquidation, however, it is telling local authorities to get lost and to join the bottom of the list of unsecured creditors. The bonds issued by IBRC in respect of four estates in County Laois - Foxborough in Portlaoise, Graigavern in Ballybrittas, the Village in Ballylynan, which I am sure the Acting Chairman is aware of, and Radharc na Sleibhte in Mountrath - range from €87,000 to €354,000 in value. The works needed to complete those estates might not require the full bonds or might require more, but access to those bonds is necessary. This situation is arising all over Ireland, as the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government know. More importantly, the Minister was aware of it when he drafted the legislation at this time last year. KPMG had been on site since last November. While the legislation sat in the Minister's top drawer last December waiting to be produced early this year, the Government introduced a local property tax. The Minister knew that the tax would be applied to certain housing estates in respect of which bonds would not be honoured as a result of an action he was about to take by liquidating IBRC in a few short months' time. However, he did not make it known at the time, causing further difficulty. Will the Minister arrange for his Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to supply a list of all of the estates affected by this issue on a county-by-county basis and the amount of bonds in issue so that we might have a reasonable understanding of the scale of the problem? Both Departments were aware of it, but it is only now coming to light at local level.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	357	On 7 February 2013, the Oireachtas passed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, appointing joint special liquidators to the IBRC with immediate effect to wind up its business and operations. Under the IBRC Act the special liquidators are obliged to independently value all the assets of the IBRC and to engage in a sales process which will maximise the return for its creditors, including the State. The matter of development bonds issued by the bank is one of a number of important issues that they must consider in exercising their statutory duties under the Act. Development bonds have traditionally been required as a condition of planning permission by local authorities. The developer must provide a bond, set out as a planning condition, which is then called upon in the event that the developer does not complete his or her development in accordance with the plans and particulars, the conditions of planning and relevant codes and regulations. I understand that the IBRC had in the past issued such bonds to local authorities in regard to loans outstanding to the institution and I am advised that there are a number of development bonds in favour of the various county councils or local authorities which are in place with the IBRC in special liquidation. It should be noted that it is likely that any liabilities which may arise in regard to any bonds, guarantees or indemnities under these arrangements will most likely rank as unsecured claims in the special liquidation. However, it must be stressed that these bonds are contingent liabilities and therefore will only be called upon where developers breach planning conditions and are not in a position to meet any liability that arises as a result. I am aware of the problems facing local authorities, and in particular with regard to unfinished housing estates, as a result of developers not complying with the terms of their planning permissions. Both the special liquidators and officials from my Department have, as a matter of concern, recently met with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, local authorities and the Housing Agency concerning this issue. While it is likely that there will be some level of exposure for local authorities as a result of this issue, the Department has confirmed that they are not yet in a position to confirm what the full extent of the exposure may be. It was agreed that work currently being conducted to confirm the actual level of exposure should be continued. It was also agreed that each local authority should consider if, following a cost-benefit analysis, a claim should be submitted to the special liquidators in order to rank as an unsecured creditor for the purposes of the liquidation. It is understood that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will consider an appropriate response for local authorities who are faced with the problem of unfinished housing estates once the full extent of that exposure is known. Throughout the liquidation process it has been acknowledged that there are, unfortunately, unavoidable costs which are associated with the agreement in regard to the promissory notes and the subsequent liquidation of the IBRC. The Deputy has identified just one category of possible creditor that may become unsecured creditors through the liquidation process. There are amounts owed by the IBRC to a range of creditors, including contractors, trade creditors and other service providers, many of which are unsecured. The proceeds from the disposal of the IBRC's assets will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities and, consequently, preferred creditors will be paid first and then the debt which NAMA will have purchased from the Central Bank will be paid. If there are proceeds available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors. The Government is aware of the difficulties the liquidation may cause for unsecured creditors, including local authorities. However, it is important to remember the overall benefits to the State from eliminating the cost of the annual promissory note. We have reduced the State's cash borrowing requirement by €20 billion over the next ten years; we have brought the State €1 billion closer to meeting our deficit targets; and Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have been consigned to history. I would advise any local authority to contact the business management team, the IBRC, Grand Parade, Dublin 6, directly in respect of any claims as they are established. It must be stressed that these bonds are contingent liabilities and therefore will only be called upon where developers breach planning conditions and are not in a position to meet any liability should it arise.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	The bad news the Minister has just given will be of no comfort to people in housing estates throughout the country. The Minister should ask the liquidator to publish a list, or make it available to us, of all the estates that are potentially affected by this matter. These planning permission conditions were granted by the local authority, which is an arm of the State. One of the conditions was that a bond should be in place. By its actions, however, the central Government has decided not to honour planning permission conditions. By removing the bond, the Government is saying that they can go to the bottom of the unsecured creditors' list when everything is transferred to NAMA.  Before the IRBC loan book is transferred to NAMA, the Minister should make provision for these bonds to be honoured. He showed a way of dealing with it himself when he said that approximately €1 billion had been saved as a result of re-financing of the promissory note. Part of that sum should be used for these purposes. I do not particularly mind whether it comes from the special liquidator, NAMA or the Department of Finance. It is not fair that people in housing estates who are paying the local property tax should be singled out to carry an additional burden by not having footpaths or public lighting installed in such estates. It is wrong for an arm of the State to undermine local authorities by taking action which will prevent councils from carrying out work in estates, which is a normal condition for a local authority.  The Minister spent months drafting this legislation and he knew it was a logical follow-on but that was not made clear to people at the time. It is only emerging now. The choice for local authorities will be simple - the work will not be done unless somebody pays for it. I am asking the Minister to come up with the balance required to complete these estates.

The liquidation will proceed in accordance with the legislation which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The order of creditor preference will be in accordance with what is normal under company law. Unsecured creditors will be considered for any residual resources that are available after the preferred creditors and the NAMA situation has been paid. As I said in my reply, meetings have been taking place between officials in my Department, officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the liquidator. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is now setting out to establish what is the full liability which will be suffered by local authorities around the country. When it has established what the full liability of all local authorities might be, it will then have the authority to come up with a programme to deal with this.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	360	The second global conference on family planning was held in London last year, involving not just politicians and advocates but also philanthropic organisations. Some €2.6 billion was committed to the area of family planning, while the G8 and developing countries set goals and targets. Today in Addis Ababa, the third global conference on family planning commenced with the focus on reducing teen pregnancy and facilitating access to contraception. Nobody would argue with the idea of reducing teen pregnancies and ensuring that young women have access to contraception. With this in mind, I have tabled this Topical Issue matter. Women can only get a three-month or six-month prescription for the contraceptive pill. This means that women will be required to bear the cost of their gender and will have to pay a prescription charge just to look after and take control of their own bodies. Last week, the Irish Medical Organisation reported that the contraceptive pill Ovranette costs 71 cent. Therefore, the prescription charge of €2.50 will be substantially more than the price of the drug. The charge far exceeds the price the State pays for that contraceptive pill. In previous parliamentary questions I have submitted to the Minister for Finance, I pointed out that oral contraceptives are subject to a 0% VAT rate. However, all non-oral contraceptives are still subject to a 13.5% VAT rate. This puts more effective methods of contraception beyond the reach of some women. I understand that the imposition of a 13.5% VAT rate on non-oral contraceptives is due to EU regulations. In the coming months I hope to work on this matter with my EU colleagues because it must be changed.  I ask the Minister to apply exclusion criteria, similar to those in the UK, whereby prescriptions for contraceptive pills would be exempt from the charge.I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions, in respect of which I await a reply, on the proposed publication of the Government's sexual health strategy. I hope this strategy will advocate and propose the inclusion of the universal provision of free contraception.  In an age where cash is king and where Governments, and rightly so, want to ensure effective use of public moneys, I ask that the Government commission the undertaking of a study of the most cost-effective way of providing universal free contraception and universal sexually transmitted infection, STI, screening based, perhaps, on the cervical check model, which provides free sexual health care and STI screening to all female residents in Ireland. I believe the contraceptive pill should be exempted from the €2.50 prescription charge because, as I have outlined, the actual cost of the pill to the State is far less than that. I believe that this is an unfair charge levied on women because of their gender. I await the Minister of State's response.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2010 provides that a person who is supplied with a drug, medicine or medical or surgical appliance on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, registered dentist or registered nurse prescriber shall be charged a prescription charge per item, subject to a limit per family per month and that this charge will be recouped from payment to the pharmacist. Since 1 January 2013, the charge per item is €1.50, subject to a maximum amount payable by a person and his or her dependants of €19.50 in any one month. Prescription charges are part of a set of reforms introduced by Government in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These include reductions in drug prices, reductions in fees paid to pharmacists under the FEMPI legislation and the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing. As announced in budget 2014, it has become necessary to increase the prescription charge due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment which requires the Government to achieve additional savings in health expenditure, with €666 million in savings targeted in 2014. The increase in prescription charges will account for €43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front-line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible. Medical card holders will be required to pay a €2.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of €25 per month for each person or family. These new rates will be effective from 1 December 2013. For the purposes of applying the charge, a spouse or a cohabiting partner, children under 16 and children aged over 16 and under 21 who are in full-time education and wholly or mainly maintained by another adult person who has full eligibility will constitute a family for the purposes of applying the charges. There are a limited number of exemptions from prescription charges. First, children who are in the care of the Health Service Executive under the Child Care Acts 1991 to 2007 are exempt. All other GMS clients will be subject to prescription charges. Second, the supply of methadone to opiate dependent clients is exempt. Methadone clients will be required to pay the charge on prescription items other than methadone. The supply of methadone for non-opiate dependent clients is not exempted. Third, as the supply of high tech medicines operates on the basis of a patient care fee, a prescription charge will not apply. The legislation does not provide for an exemption from the prescription charges for any particular category of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliance. The three areas of exemption to which I referred are referable to particular categories of individuals rather than to drugs, medicines or medical or surgical appliances. There are no plans to provide for this category of exemption.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I thank the Minister of State for his response which gives me some hope. As the Minister of State rightly pointed out, the exemptions do not apply to any particular drug but to a particular cohort of people. The people who are most likely to be taking the contraceptive pill are women, who are a distinguished group in society. There is scope if the willingness exists to provide this exemption. It is unfair that women because of their gender must pay this charge. As indicated in the Minister of State's response, the exemptions to which he referred relate not to a particular drug, but to a particular cohort of people. I believe this is something we should do. We know that when women can provide space and time between each of their children, the outcomes for those children, women and households are better. This is something with which we should be able to help and support women. We know that having effective family planning in a progressive society leads to good outcomes for children and women. In my humble opinion, it also makes them more productive and effective members of society. I believe there is scope to apply an exemption in respect of the contraceptive pill.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I am not sure I can add a huge amount more to what I have already said, namely, that the scheme of the rules comprehends exemptions for specific individuals or categories of individuals. I understand what the Deputy is saying, including the argument made in her rejoinder. However, this would ultimately amount to an exemption with respect to a particular type of medicine or drug, which is not provided for under current rules. Even if the exemption were to be extended to a category-gender, this would still mean an exemption with regard to, presumably, contraception and not all prescription items. We have a difficulty in terms of how the current rules are applied. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and note the compelling points made by her in terms of the importance of the sexual health strategy being brought forward in the context of screening and, in particular, sexual health issues, which issues the Deputy has previously drawn to the attention of the House. I agree with her that they are important priorities.

Parents in Ballyfermot were shocked last week when they learned by way of letter from the De La Salle national school that it proposes to amalgamate with three other national schools in the area, namely, St. Raphael's national school, St. Michael's national school and St. Gabriel's national school. The original De La Salle school was built in 1952, which is around the time the new estate of Ballyfermot was built. There were three schools under the De La Salle brothers at that time, including Scoil Íosagáin, Scoil Sheosaimh and Scoil Mhuire, which over time amalgamated into one school. Two of the schools amalgamated in 1981 and the third school was amalgamated only two years ago, which then became De La Salle national school. I accept pupil numbers at the school have fallen. However, there are currently 292 pupils in the De La Salle school, almost 200 in St. Gabriel's, more than 200 in St. Raphael's and almost 300 in St. Michael's, which when combined means the new structure will have more than 1,000 pupils, which is a substantial amount of young people. Parents are concerned at the possible loss of the school buildings owned by the De La Salle brothers and school properties, including playing fields and so on, which have served the young children of Ballyfermot since 1952. The reason given by the Diocesan authorities is that it is disinvesting from the school, which is to be welcomed. I am not opposed to that. The concern is in relation to the suddenness of the decision.Were the Department and the Minister aware of the change that was taking place in Ballyfermot? As far as I know, Department officials had a meeting with the church authorities in February, when the disinvestment was agreed. Were concerns raised at the time about the school buildings and structures and whether this eventuality would affect the teaching in what would be left in those schools? We need to ensure there is no overcrowding at the three schools run by the Dominican order, that the pupil-teacher ratios in those schools are not affected, and that there are no job losses. The key to all of this is that the land owned by the De La Salle brothers is not sold to an outsider and at the very least, that the buildings and the land be transferred to the Dominican order. I would like to see it transferred to the State. I urge the Minister of State to respond positively to this change to ensure people in Ballyfermot can rely on the best possible educational outcome, which means the best possible educational campus. That is available in the existing campuses and with the existing structure.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position in respect of the Ballyfermot national schools to which the Deputy referred. The four schools concerned are St. Raphael's national school, Dominican convent, a senior girls infant mixed school; St. Gabriel's national school, Dominican campus, a senior girls infant mixed school; De La Salle national school, a senior boys school, which is an amalgamation of Scoil Íosagáin-Mhuire and Scoil Mhuire-Seosamh; and St. Michael's national school, Dominican convent, a senior girls infant mixed school. The decision-making authority for any amalgamation or reorganisation of schools in an area belongs to the patron of the schools, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. My Department's role is to facilitate any such proposal or discussions between the relevant parties. The initiative for any amalgamation or reorganisation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and patrons. Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must involve consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level. The financial consequences associated with amalgamations would also have to take into account the continuing requirements to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and the level of budgetary provision available at the time. My Department carried out parental surveys on primary schools patronage earlier this year, which included a survey of the areas of Palmerstown, Ballyfermot, Chapelizod and Cherry Orchard. Based on the results of the survey, where the parental demand for an alternative patron was confirmed, my Department asked the Catholic patrons to consider options for reconfiguring their schools to allow the transfer of a school to a new patron. The surveys also indicated a level of preference by parents for a re­organisation of schools to facilitate more co-educational provision. My Department understands that the patron is in ongoing discussions with the school principals and chairpersons of the boards of management of schools in the Ballyfermot area as part of its assessment as to future school accommodation needs in that regard. I advise the Deputy that the Minister would be concerned that any proposed changes are well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system. I can confirm that my Department has not received any proposals from the patron or trustees on the future accommodation arrangements for the four schools referred to.

A survey was carried out but I do not think that anybody expected, as a result of a demand for co-education, that there would be an amalgamation and the closure of one of the schools. I am in favour of co-education in the school complex, as are the parents, but I do not believe this is the best outcome. I take on board the commitment made by the Minister of State that the Minister has the final approval, but what was presented to parents was a fait accompli. These schools suffered the consequences of child sex abuse in the past, and one of the worst offenders, Fr. Tony Walsh, who was cited in chapter 19 of the Murphy report, was one of those who went to these schools to pick out victims at random. They have suffered the consequences and we do not want a situation where the educational atmosphere is affected in any way by an amalgamation which adds to overcrowding and which increases the pupil-teacher ratio, but which also limits the scope for development in the future. I urge the Minister of State to ensure there is no sale of land involved, or at the very least, that the order is encouraged to transfer the lands and buildings into the possession of the State which can then work with the remaining three schools under the Dominican order, if they continue to be the patrons of those schools, to run successful schools, as is currently the case in Ballyfermot. I am hopeful the Minister of State and the Minister can ensure parents' fears are put at ease over the next few weeks and months as the De La Salle order withdraws from the school.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	Schools in this country are independent, autonomous entities managed by a board of management, and each board of management has a significant representation from the parent body of the school, the local community and the staff of the school as well. No decision on the future of a school can be taken without significant consultation with all those groups, nor can any decision be taken by this Department or any other entity to force schools into amalgamating if they do not wish to do so. The Deputy's fears about any potential increase of the pupil-teacher ratio are not well founded on the basis that, irrespective of the amalgamation process and whatever new proposals that might emanate from such a process would be, the national pupil-teacher ratio would still apply and there would be no disadvantage to any children in those schools as a result. My Department has not received any information or formal proposal from any of the patrons of the aforementioned schools as to what the amalgamation process might look like, and until such time as they do, there is no point in commenting further. When that proposal is made known to us, we will be more than happy to discuss it with the Deputy.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I welcome the opportunity to continue the discussion on this Bill. In the short time I had on Thursday last, I noted that the budget is in two parts. There are two announcements on the day totalling an hour and a half, with the two Ministers explaining their different elements of the budget. We hear all that debate on the day in question, including the financial motions, and we have several votes on those proposals on budget day.When one starts to tease out the hidden bits within the expenditure report and the budgetary measures, one starts to see the detail and the full effect of the budget and its consequences in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill and the Finance Bill, which we are debating. None of those sections can be separated from one another because they are the budget in total. Nobody can say they voted for this or that because each and every aspect of the budget is intertwined with the other. That is why it is important that when my party put forward proposals for an alternative budget, all our figures and measures were intertwined and balanced and the changes were across the board. They were not simply changes to social welfare or taxation measures but also to how Departments are funded. The problem with this budget, as with every budget since this Government came to power and in the term of the previous Government, is that the burden remains on the most vulnerable in society. I have heard Members on the other side of the House argue that the burden on the wealthiest in our society has been increased. As a percentage that is probably true, but the disposable income of the most vulnerable in society, those who depend on social welfare, or those on low income, is greatly reduced, whereas the disposable income of the richest in our society is increased. Those who are vulnerable cannot take additional hits in budget after budget. The more the Government goes after them, the more it affects their ability to survive and the more it affects the local economy. That is one of the arguments I had two weeks ago with the Minister for Social Protection and have had with her predecessors. The more they cut social welfare, the more they affect local business and suppliers because every last penny of social welfare is spent. It is not put into banks or put away for long holidays abroad. It is spent and returns directly to the Exchequer quite quickly through VAT and wages. The richest in our society have the ability to squirrel away money in various different ways, whether in bank accounts, shares or offshore accounts. That means it is often beyond the reach of our tax system. Some quite high profile figures in our society, who regard themselves as Irish men and women, have moved their accounts and financial interests lock, stock and barrel offshore and pay no dividend on money raised in our society to the Irish Exchequer. That is sad to see. It is a questionable practice. We must continually consider how our taxation system can capture those who hold moneys, who claim to be Irish citizens, who work in Ireland but conveniently manage to be out of the country long enough to avoid paying tax here. It is a pity that the low rate of corporation tax was not strengthened in this Bill to ensure it is paid or that at least a higher proportion of what should be paid is paid. We have seen reports of some big companies that have managed to avoid paying a large proportion of that tax. In some cases they pay only 4%. That is not a welcome taxation measure. It is welcome only if it is implemented as other taxation measures are implemented for the ordinary worker. What type of message goes out if large corporations and rich people in society can evade millions in tax yet the State would hound ordinary people to pay tax, including asking them to pay in advance, as the Revenue Commissioners have requested for the property tax? The context for the budget needs to be taken into account as well because it is not intended just to balance books but to re-balance society, to address the fact that 16% of our society is at risk of poverty and that there is a continual brain drain of between 70,000 and 80,000 people emigrating every year. More and more, these are young people who have the skills and the education we will require to rebuild our society and our economy. That is one part of the context and the other is that those who are employed and have been successful in breaking the cycle are increasingly part-time, casual or contract workers. Sustainable full-time paid and permanent employment is becoming a thing of the past. It is dangerous for our society to build our economy on the casualisation of work because it is very difficult to plan future income from those casual, part-time or contractual workers. There are 175,000 people in this country who are long-term unemployed. The budget did not introduce substantial measures to address that problem. Elsewhere today there has been a debate about the youth guarantee. The Taoiseach is debating it in Europe. That will only be a guarantee if he succeeds in substantially increasing the amount of money that Europe will deliver, and the amount this State puts in, rather than reducing it because the Minister for Social Protection has taken €32 million away from the young unemployed people in our society and has retained only €14 million of it as a job creation, youth guarantee measure. That means that €18 million has disappeared into the black hole of the economy never to be seen again rather than being used as a stimulus with a substantial increase as well. According to the International Labour Organization, the cost of creating sustainable jobs and for the guarantee to live up to its name is in the region of €6,600 per participant, yet the combined measures the Government has announced will lead to approximately €500 per participant. That is a substantial difference and that figure comes from the possible figure for the youth guarantee across Europe and the €14 million that has been set aside. That will not make any major dent in the level of youth unemployment. Any measure is welcome if it manages to address the problem, but it is not a guarantee if one cannot live up to it as a guarantee, and that is what some of the discussions in Europe today were about. It is a sad state of affairs if this Government and the European Union as a whole is sending out a message to young people that the youth guarantee is not in fact a youth guarantee.The only way to ensure a real youth guarantee is proper investment in job creation for young people. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, mentioned that core payments were once again protected, but no such thing has happened. Year on year she has managed to interfere with the core payments of those on social protection. She has changed and reduced core payments this year for jobseekers aged under 26 years, and the same applies with the supplementary welfare allowance. She has interfered with the illness benefit, and earlier this year the jobseeker's benefit was changed, with three months being taken off. The fuel allowance was reduced last year. Child benefit was substantially interfered with this year and there will be another change in January as a consequence of last year's budget. These are all core payments and no one can say they are not. There are 112,000 families on the housing list and that number is growing. The Minister can point to subsidies to private landlords in the form of rent allowance, the rental accommodation scheme or the proposed housing allowance payment. The problem is that at the same time the Government is doing that, rents are going up and the effect will be that the investment in private landlords will lead to reduced levels of accommodation for those on the housing list. If the money currently directed towards private landlords was instead directed towards local authorities - I am referring to local authorities rather than voluntary housing associations - then the Government would see a better and more sustainable outcome for long-term delivery of housing. Announcements were made in the budget that additional moneys would be made available for voluntary housing bodies. Again, local authorities have been left out despite that they have had a very good record of delivering for communities and those on the housing list over the years. Another problem is the proposal for the home adaptation grant and the fact it has been cut by 40%, a mean cut considering it comes on top of the previous year's cut. This year money is being made available to insulate houses and I have no major problem with that because it is a job stimulus measure, it is required and it should be available across the board. Local authority housing should be the first to benefit from the insulation scheme because the people in those houses often depend on social welfare, they are the lowest paid and cannot afford to upgrade their houses. The fact that the housing adaptation grant has been substantially cut is affecting the most vulnerable in society, the very people the Government said it would protect in the programme for Government. These are the people who need doors widened because the wheelchair will not fit into the house, a ramp at the front of the house, bars to pull themselves into the house and bars to help them walk around the basement of the house. They may need a toilet and bathroom downstairs because the house they live in is no longer useable by them because they may be confined to a wheelchair or they may find it difficult to walk. These are the people who are now going to be on longer waiting lists. I know the position in my city, Dublin, and I presume it is the same across the board. Dublin City Council ran out of money to facilitate adaptations for disabled people in June this year. The miserly money that the city council gets from the Government to facilitate these housing adaptations will be spent or committed for those who have been waiting on the list prior to June this year and those who have been added to it since then. It is a false economy because we are finding that people end up staying in hospitals or nursing homes because their houses are not fit for purpose and that is a further cost to the State. This is a substantial cost and I have dealt with people who have ended up staying in hospital or nursing homes for several months. In one case the delay was nine months before the person was allowed home and only then when the family managed to get a loan from the credit union to make the necessary adaptations to the house. The family could ill-afford it and they are still struggling to cope. The other proposal highlighted to deal with the unemployment crisis among young people was JobBridge. I will not go into detail because I have had this argument with the Minister for Social Protection. The community employment schemes are problematic as well because there has been no reinstatement of the training grant. Therefore, those on the community employment schemes still do not have a guaranteed outcome and they are not getting the same training as in the past. Apprentices have also been hit by a deduction. They are forced to make deductions while in education. They will suffer the consequences and perhaps this will discourage some young people from staying in an apprentice scheme. Perhaps they will take the bád bán to America or Australia. I hope they stay and I encourage anyone in an apprenticeship to continue in it, despite this Government, to get the qualification and use it in this country. We live in hope that we can create an economy and society of which these young people can be proud. Sinn Féin made its proposals and the Minister rejected them because he did not implement them. I am disappointed that once again the Minister failed to take the opportunity to introduce a wealth tax. We have had this argument across the Chamber in recent years. A wealth tax has been introduced in other countries. It is not something we simply plucked out of the air. We did not decide on an exorbitant figure to be dropped down on all the rich people in society. The Department should at least take the opportunity in the coming months to see exactly how it could work. Let us consider the French model. The authorities in France have considered increasing the tax and the percentage charged on people with wealth. Let us consider that as a model to see whether it could impact or raise the type of money required instead of the property tax, which is a blunt instrument, as we have seen in recent weeks. I heard some on the Government benches bemoaning the property tax, how it was implemented and the fact it does not take account of maintenance fees and so on. These are the very people who voted against having a proper debate on it. They will suffer the consequences for its introduction and the fact it is a regressive rather than progressive measure, as all taxation should be.

We must consider the regions as well. I wish to speak about Cork in particular. I welcome the Minister's decision to give funding to the creation of the convention centre in the city of Cork. It is a major decision and a massive boost to the region.In the short term, it will create employment through the creation of the convention centre but, more important, in the long term it will present opportunities to the people of Cork, as well as the offering of choice in entertainment and in the tourist attraction Cork city is and will become in the future as a destination for the conference market, the music industry and other activities linked to the aforementioned convention centre. I greatly welcome that the Minister has had the confidence in the city of Cork to allocate this money. It also is important that the city council gets its priorities right in respect of the location of the convention centre and that the process undertaken by Cork City Council will be carried out in a way that will ensure the convention centre is of benefit to the people and the region of Cork. I also wish to speak of Cork in the context of the living city initiative and the benefit that can bring. While I again commend the Minister, I wish to ask him ceist amháin. In the context of Cork, is there a possibility that this could be extended beyond the owner-occupier sector? The simple reason for this question is that many people who seek to live within the catchment area of Cork city are working in the foreign direct investment sector. They do not own the properties but seek to live in apartment dwellings in the area. This suggestion should be considered in the context of the potential to unlock further growth for the city of Cork. The maps I have to hand show how metropolitan Cork has seen a huge growth in the Carrigaline, Glanmire, Ballincollig, Douglas, Grange and Frankfield areas, as well as Rochestown. Even though the population of the city centre is experiencing a modest increase, it requires further enticement. If the living city initiative could be tweaked, it is possible that more people could come into the city. The docklands project has been paused on foot of what has been happening in the downturn, but the city of Cork has significant potential that can be unlocked as the real metropolitan hub for the region. Linked to this is the importance of an active airport. While I wish the people of Shannon good luck, I am a little worried the growth of Shannon and so on may mean Cork is being forgotten. Cork is one of the oldest cities, is highly important and its people have played a major role in the development of the region. When I hear Deputy Ó Snodaigh talk about corporation tax, he and other Members should consider the benefit of EMC, Apple Computer and the pharmaceutical industries located in the harbour of Cork on foot of Ireland's corporation tax rate. Moreover, this is thanks to the incredible ability of the colleges and universities in Cork to attract people to come into the city and the area around Cork Harbour. The Minister has played a key role in retaining the current rate of corporation tax, but one must never discredit the fact that people came to the city of Cork to locate and to give employment. This budget and Finance (No. 2) Bill are about job creation and I commend the Bill to the House.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	The context of this year's debate on the Finance Bill is more interesting than usual, because it coincides with the successful conclusion of the 12th and final review mission of the programme with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Despite what many doomsayers might say, this represents a significant milestone. The budgets for the years between 2011 and 2014 implemented consolidation measures of almost €16.4 billion. I acknowledge this has been difficult for the people and many unpalatable decisions have been taken. Nevertheless, steady progress has been made in recent budgets, which has brought about a situation in which the public finances are back in check. Moreover, jobs are being created at a rate of 3,000 per month, economic growth has returned and the State is set to emerge from the troika programme on 15 December next. I wish to refer to some specific elements of the Finance (No. 2) Bill. I welcome the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors. It has been a hugely significant initiative for the tourism industry and underlines the commitment of the Government to job creation in the sector. I believe the beauty of this initiative is that it protects the primary small to medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of the economy and society to an extent. The continuation of this initiative has given business owners confidence in what still is an extremely difficult economic environment. While the measures remain in place, they should be used to maintain value for money and to support existing jobs and investment in further job creation. The decision to reduce the air travel tax to a zero rate was most welcome. As a direct result, Ryanair is set to provide eight new routes at Shannon Airport. This positive announcement will create 300 direct jobs and the additional 300,000 passengers travelling on these new routes will create many indirect jobs in hotels, guesthouses, bars, restaurants, shops and petrol stations throughout the mid-west region and along the west coast. For the first time in years, there is a positivity about Shannon Airport's future. I compliment the chairperson of the board, Rose Hynes, the new chief executive officer, Neil Pakey, as well as the management and staff at Shannon Airport on their work in restoring the fortunes of Shannon. I am informed that in the first year of operating as an independent entity, Shannon Airport is set to break even and might even return a small profit, which is a highly significant achievement by the new structure there. The specific measure to reduce the rate of air travel tax to zero will help Shannon Airport to continue on a path of growth. As for agricultural taxation, I welcome the review as outlined in the Minister's Budget Statement. It is timely, necessary and a significant component in the mixture that must be dealt with if the ambitious targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy are to be met. There is an intrinsic link between the taxation system and the full potential of Irish farmland productivity, and while this nettle has not yet been grasped, it badly needs to be. I believe the Food Harvest 2020 goals are pie in the sky and will not succeed until this issue is dealt with. The construction industry has suffered greatly in recent years. While construction levels equating to 25% of gross domestic product are unsustainable, construction levels in the low single digits as a percentage of GDP are just as unwelcome. As a concerted effort to get to the international average of 12% of GDP is a worthy aspiration, I welcome the new home improvement initiative included in the budget. I wish to make a final point in respect of the single parent's tax credit. Will the Minister accept amendments on Committee Stage to ensure there are no unintended consequences arising from the changes that have been made?
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	In introducing the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Minister stated the objectives of the Government over the past two and a half years were, first, the implementation, and second, the exiting of the EU-ECB-IMF bailout. In parallel with this, the Government sought to support business by creating jobs, putting people back to work and putting people into education and retraining. In the context of this budget and Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Government certainly is on target to achieve this. I compliment the Minister on his personal input in this regard, as well as on the leadership and direction he has shown over the past two and a half years in getting us to this point. Members of the Opposition will criticise elements of a budget and Finance Bill, and in fairness to them, none of us is perfect and neither is this measure. Despite what the Opposition might say, however, it certainly has received overwhelming endorsement from the private sector. The president of the Construction Industry Federation, Mr. Tom Parlon, represents an industry that was devastated by the mismanagement of the previous Government and has come out strongly in favour of the incentives that are in place for construction. Deputy Carey mentioned the housing renovations initiative, but initiatives are also in place in respect of schools and prisons. While Deputy Buttimer has left the Chamber, I note a new prison is being built in Cork although I do not know whether he will take credit for that. In addition, Limerick Prison is being renovated to upgrade and modernise it. From my perspective, I must welcome the measures with regard to farming and, in particular, in respect of farm consolidation and the handing over of farms to next-of-kin and to sons and daughters. I welcome the concessions that have been made and which will apply up to 2015 in this regard, as well as in respect of stamp duty. I also welcome the new initiatives regarding long-term leasing, which will enable land to be brought into full production and act as an incentive for all land to be utilised. I look forward to more such initiatives. I also welcome the €23 million that has been invested in a new beef genomics scheme which will be of great benefit to the suckler herd, which has been experiencing some degree of difficulty and pressure. There have also been initiatives in respect of starting one's own business, and Deputy Carey mentioned the initiatives pertaining to air travel and tourism.Those initiatives are important not only for Limerick and Shannon but for the mid-west and the midlands. I am glad the Government is concentrating on that sector. We had an immediate response to that from Ryanair which launched new routes out of Shannon. I also welcome the initiatives in the justice area, particularly the recommencement of recruitment to the Garda Síochána, which will result in the Garda college in Templemore being used again, and the €9 million that has been invested in the Garda traffic fleet. There are a number of issues to cover, and with only four minutes allocated for contributions, I may not get to mention a number of them. I want to end on the issue on which I began regarding the Minister and the EU-ECB-IMF bailout. Many people have suffered in recent years on foot of the poor decisions taken resulting from the bank crisis, especially those who lost their jobs, those in receipt of social welfare benefit and those in receipt of disability benefit. I am sure the Acting Chairman would agree that 15 December will be a red letter day for Ireland when it is hoped, under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, we will exit the bailout programme. I ask that the Minister use the mechanisms of the Finance Bill to grant those who have suffered most a bonus over the Christmas period, namely, that social welfare recipients be given a bonus that was traditionally given some years ago. I ask that he do that as a gesture of goodwill and of hope for the future that this country is getting back to where it once was.

Since the announcement of budget 2014 I have been contacted by many people in east Galway regarding its various provisions. In particular, I have been contacted by three groups, trades people, tourism and restaurant business owners and separated fathers, and I will concentrate on the issues affecting them. In recent weeks I have encountered many trades people who have welcomed the fact that the Government has finally taken action to level the playing field for tax complying trades people by incentivising the employment of those whose tax affairs are in order by home owners seeking to avail of the new home renovation incentive scheme. Initially, many of those trades people were worried that the timing of the introduction of the scheme could adversely affect their work in the final two months of this year, but this matter has since been addressed and those fears allayed in what I believe to be yet another common sense and probity measure taken by the Government. The initiative may also be the spur or incentive that some home owners need to get work carried out on their home. It is to be hoped that many people who formerly worked in the construction industry will benefit as a result of this measure.  We have to make doing business easier for small businesses which are the economic lifeblood of Ireland. That is the reason I very much welcome the retention of the lower rate of VAT in the hospitality sector. Small restaurant business owners in east Galway expressed the fear to me that a rise in the VAT rate would hamper their efforts to attract business in what remains a very difficult climate. I believe that business owners recognise the Government's unwavering efforts in terms of job creation and recognise that it is only through job creation that a stagnant economy can be brought back to life. One job can lift a family back to economic viability. That is the reason we have to continue in our efforts to support small businesses. The catering sector is not the only one affected by the decision in regard to VAT. Hotel and tourism business owners have also welcomed it, and I look forward to seeing more tourists in the west next year, especially given the abolition of the travel tax and the pledge that increased numbers of air passengers will be brought into Ireland as a result. Tourism spending is badly needed in the west and efforts such as this initiative and the travel tax must be applauded. I also welcome the retention of the current rate of corporation tax. It is important that the message is put out in as forceful manner as possible that this is an integral part of the Irish regime and that it is something that is not up for renegotiation. While many of the reactions I have received on a personal level to the budget have been positive, I have been contacted in recent weeks by many separated fathers, and each has outlined to me exactly how the change in the tax credit system will impact on them. The tax implications are significant and I welcome the statement by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that situations will be examined where the primary carer does not have a tax liability. I believe this may help the circumstances of many separated fathers. However, many fathers may well continue to be adversely affected as a result.  I believe that the issue raised by the controversy over the single parent tax credit is one that merits much greater investigation. Family break-ups are a fact of life and the Government has ensured proper provision is made for children. In cases where parents live separately, there is an added cost of two properties to be maintained in terms of property tax, lighting, heating, etc. The size of the house provided by the secondary carer, the father in many cases, has to be sufficiently large to accommodate the children in order that they can stay over. Further investigation is needed in terms of the burden that is being placed on separated families and we must examine measures needed to balance this while simultaneously ensuring families who live together are in no way disadvantaged and that no financial obstacle is put in the way of families waiting to reunite. Borrowing €12 billion per annum to keep the country afloat is unsustainable. We have to progress to a more sustainable budgetary framework, and that is what budget 2014 achieves. The deficit is lowered and all sections of Government will have to reflect the new reality with leaner management of greater resources. Had the focus been on having a much leaner Government during the years of the boom, spending would not have spiralled to the degree it had, but there is nothing to be gained from bemoaning decisions made. Although it marks a milestone on the road to recovery, there will be no celebrations as the troika exits the country on 15 December. It is a welcome step but one which fails to put money in the purses of householders. We have a long road to travel and the people will not rest until such time as unemployment levels have been drastically reduced and young people once again have the option of living and working in their own country.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	This Bill is another chapter in outstanding stewardship of the economy by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, since 2011. It represents another serious effort by him and by Government to get our people back to work. All its contents and strategies are predicated on that idea of having our people working again. It is an important step. We can be very happy with the progress to date, although we are in no sense complacent. It is worthy of note that when we came into office there were 400,000 people unemployed and now the live register is at its lowest since 2009, with 3,000 jobs being created every month. A prestigious development and one that supports our IT sector is expansion by Facebook of its European headquarters in Dublin with the creation of an extra 1,000 jobs. That indicates where we are at. We have travelled a huge journey. Our economy has returned to growth with 0.4% GDP growth in quarter two. We have had two successive years of economic growth in 2011 and 2012. Real GDP increased by 2.2% in 2011 and 0.2% in 2012. We have successfully executed all obligations under the three year bailout programme, a key step in the process of leaving the programme next month, which is very welcome. One of the vital components of our local economy is our small and medium enterprises. It provides employment for 70% of our workforce, and that sector has created 39,000 new jobs during the past 12 months. In recognition of this fact, the Minister devised a ten point tax reform plan aimed at assisting with cashflow and supporting the creation of more jobs. Part 1, chapter 3, section 21 of the Bill increases from €200,000 to €300,000 the amount of expenditure eligible for research and development. That is important. Business can increase expenditure from 10% to 15% on research and development, which can be outsourced. Now more than ever our small businesses need to be examine ways in which they can set themselves apart in a competitive way. This investment is part of that. Part 1, Chapter 2, section 6 has an interesting new provision for anyone who is long-term unemployed. An important point that should be put on the record and that merits repeating often enough for people to cop on to it is that there is a two-year exemption from income tax up to a maximum of €40,000 available to anyone who is on the live register for more than 12 months and who wants to set up a new business. On top of that we have managed to retain the 9% VAT rate for tourism related services. That is critical in my area and every area of the country. The reduction of the air travel tax to 0% is critical. The 13.5% tax relief on home renovations will be very important and will kick-start the construction sector. The credit guarantee scheme is important. The initiatives in regard to agriculture and the transfer of land and partnerships are very important. The Finance Bill is crafted around job creation strategies, incentives for further job creation and initiatives in that area. We have been successful.Our record with the 9% VAT rate supports the view that the initiatives and incentives in the Bill will work. All our actions as a Government and everything we do should be predicated on that principle. It is important that our people get back to work and everyone gets to participate in the economy and in society.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	I wish to share time with Deputies Tom Fleming and Joe Higgins. The failure to achieve a write-down to the cost of the bank bailout is a huge millstone around the neck of every citizen and it is one of the reasons we are facing a budget of this nature next year and the year after. The notion that is the final tough budget and that if people straighten their backs, they will come out of the recession in the next year or two is not true. This gives false hope to people about the future. Interest payments on State debt are equal to the amount being borrowed in 2014. The interest payments for 2014 are €8.2 billion against Government borrowing of €8.16 billion. Interest payments will increase over the next few years. Interest payments in 2014 equate to the total spend on education and 50% of health spending. The portion of the national debt, which is the result of the bank bailout forced on the State by the ECB to protect German, French and British banks and the EU banking system, is odious and it should be repudiated. The refusal by the Government to contemplate an increase in taxes on wealth, high incomes and corporate profits means the costs of the crisis since 2008 have been unfairly loaded on those who can least afford it. A total of €30 billion in austerity measures through cuts in social and capital spending and tax hikes, levies and charges that adversely affect the poor and those on low and moderate incomes have destroyed domestic demand and activity in the economy. I question a number of the contributions made by Government Members about the policies to get people back to work through tax credits and to help small businesses. There is a major question mark over these incentives because if people do not have money to spend, jobs cannot be created. The Exchequer returns showed that VAT receipts for August were almost 28%, or €65 million, below the Government's target for the month. VAT is considered one of the big four revenue streams and it was €2.45 million or 3.5% behind target for the first eight months of the year. If people are not spending, VAT returns drop. While this needs to be examined more closely over a longer period, it seems to indicate people are not spending. Until they do, the economy will not turn around. If the Government continues to take money out of people's pockets, that will be the outcome. A regime of tax reliefs that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy, big business and those on high incomes has been maintained and it is estimated to cost the Exchequer €8 billion, which equals the debt interest bill the State must pay annually. The Government has deliberately followed a policy in its three budgets of protecting the elite at the expense of the majority. The single parent tax change provided for in the legislation is indicative of this approach. The Government will not touch the wealthy, corporate tax, anyone earning more than €100,000 or the assets of the wealthy which have increased in recent years. The value of the assets of the 300 wealthiest people in the State increased by €3.6 billion in 2012. Their assets are worth €66.6 billion. This includes helicopters, art and so on. While the Government will not touch these assets, it saw an opportunity to cut the income of single parents. I was contacted by one man about this who said, "The first point is relatively straightforward and it relates to the repeatedly stated fact that the programme for Government cannot and does not provide for an increase in income tax. I have pointed out to the Minister that any removal of any portion of a tax credit and/or extended tax band will de facto amount to an increase in income tax payable, therefore breaching directly the programme for Government". That is a good point. This is a roundabout way of taxing the income of ordinary people who can ill afford it and who are trying their best to put their children through school, to rear them the best way they can and to support their families. This is a blunt instrument with which to go after people. It is shameful and the Minister should reverse this cut. He should take this measure out of the Bill and give back people a little dignity to rear their children.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	The Bill and recent budget measures have failed to address the imbalance in our society and we have a continuation of the regressive measures that are impacting disproportionately on the weakest and most vulnerable in the State. It is again a case of stripping the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed and those in negative equity or mortgage arrears while billions of euro are handed to foreign bondholders. The cumulative impact of budgetary cuts leaves many people experiencing gross inequality and social exclusion on a daily basis. This is epitomised by the draconian cuts to social welfare assistance to the under 26 age group. It is claimed that social welfare payments to these people are a disincentive to work but there are strong financial incentives for them to seek work. Prior to the recent budget cut, a young person aged 23 or 24 was in receipt of €144 per week and those aged 25 received €188 per week. It is proposed to reduce these payments to €100 and €144, respectively. The majority of young jobseekers do not claim secondary benefits and, therefore, this is the maximum payment they receive. Even if they were to take up a job on the minimum wage rate, they would have weekly take home pay of €329 minus the universal social charge. There is a financial incentive, therefore, for young jobseekers to take up employment. It is also claimed that this decision will encourage young people to take up education, training and work experience opportunities. It is estimated that these cuts will impact on at least 20,000 jobseekers in 2014 based on the current live register. This does not take into account new claimants aged between 22 and 25 from January 2014. An analysis shows there are 3,250 places on the Tús, Momentum and JobBridge schemes and it is not possible to indicate how many places will be created by JobsPlus. This means 20,000 people will be incentivised to take up 3,250 guaranteed places. There is a lack of quality education, training and work experience opportunities and the reality is young people cannot access places that do not exist in the first place.  The youth guarantee scheme guarantees a young person a quality education, training or work experience place if he or she is unemployed for four months or more, and the initial allocation of €14 million is welcome. However, it represents only 5% of the estimated annual cost of a comprehensive scheme. While it is difficult to estimate the cost of the implementation of the youth guarantee in Ireland, the National Youth Council of Ireland ascertained earlier this year that full implementation would cost €217 million per annum based on the number of young people unemployed for six months or more. It is encouraging that the Government can access European funding to complement Exchequer funding of at least 66% of the overall expenditure.Will the Minister ensure maximum use is made of funds available? There is no breakdown of the €46 million proposed for education, training and work experience opportunities for under 25s and, more important, the number of places being provided. At best, 3,250 new places will be created and additional places will depend largely on employer recruitment of those under 26 years of age. The JobsPlus and JobBridge are demand-led schemes and it will depend on the employer taking on employees and interns. The statistics show that 29% of interns on JobBridge are under 25 years of age. The reduction from 12 to six months in eligibility for under 25s for JobsPlus is welcome. Will the Minister consider extending this to 25 years olds? There is a fallacy that most young jobseekers live at home and, therefore, have financial support from their parents and families and do not want welfare payments. The reality is that where young jobseekers are living at home and apply for jobseeker's allowance, their claims are means tested and the parents' income is taken into account in a process known as benefit and privilege assessment. The statistics show that more 19,000 applicants under the age of 25 had their applications for jobseeker's allowance refused between 2009 to 2012. This clearly shows that the payment is going to young people who are living in low income households. The Government stated that this cut will only apply to young people on jobseeker's allowance but they represent 92% of all claimants as the majority of young people lack the 104 weeks PRSI contributions to qualify for jobseeker's benefit. They have not entered employment or they have worked for fewer than two years. The under 26 welfare payment is one of the more contentious issues. This should be rescinded over the coming months for the reasons I explained. Will the Minister review the matter given the huge number of places that will be needed to cater for these people? In the medium to short term, the jobs will not be available. We need the economy to pick up a bit before we implement all these tough measures.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	I want to protest against another despicable use of the guillotine in the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013. Fine Gael and the Labour Party have again displayed outright contempt for the views of elected representatives who have come into the House even in the last hour and who have been crowded into very small time slots rather than engage in the type of consideration of the measures proposed in the Bill, which is needed. The Finance (No. 2) Bill enshrines the measures contained in another right-wing austerity-driven budget. Fine Gael and the Labour Party have continued the disastrous policies of their predecessors, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, which is essentially to continue to place the burden of the crisis of European capitalism and the crisis resulting from the madness of the profit-driven financial markets system on to the shoulders of working class people, of middle and lower income workers, of pensioners, of young people and of society generally. This budget contains the most cruel attacks and contempt for the youth, with the cuts to the jobseeker's payments for younger people up to 25 years, which is not so young, and with the cynical strategy of forcing them to take the most menial jobs at the discretion of whatever employers offer. There is a cruel attack on maternity benefit and on elderly people's medical cards. In fewer than two months, every household in this country, the majority of whom are ordinary low or middle income workers, unemployed or pensioners, will face a full year demand for the new home tax, or the so-called "local property tax".  Currently all over this country, construction crews are breaking up the pavements in front of people's homes and placing water meters in front of them at a cost of €538 million of taxpayers' funds to facilitate another tax on a vital natural necessity, namely, water. Bogus conservation arguments have been advanced that it is about preserving water which is already treated with taxpayers' funds. We do not take that seriously from this Government or from previous Governments which, over the past 20 years, lifted not a finger to include significant water conservation measures in the building by-laws that could have drastically reduced the amount of treated water used in households. The savings said to result from metering, if equivalent to British use which is privatised and metered, may be 2% of treated water. Some 40% leaks into the ground, so it is obvious where that €538 million should be invested, namely, in rectifying the infrastructure. The Government again chose to hit ordinary people with further new burdens as part of the continuing demand by the European establishment that the financial markets systems, the gamblers and speculators, would be bailed out. A wealth tax for every 1% on the very top echelons of this society could yield €580 million per annum. Seamus Coffey, a conservative economist, reckons that the effective rate of corporation tax is 8%. Therefore, for every 1% increase in corporation tax, €525 million could be raised. If it was even approaching the European average of 18%, that would be a substantial extra resource. Progressively increased income tax placed on the top 10% of income earners would have yielded very significant resources, as would a financial transaction tax. It is outrageous that this country will pay approximately €8.5 billion in interest alone on the odious debt imposed on our people by the European establishment and accepted by cowardly Governments for debts with which the Irish people have nothing to do. There are substantial resources there that could have been used for major job investment programmes. The Nevin institute states that for every €1 billion one invests in infrastructure, 14,000 jobs can be created. We could, therefore, have programmes for tens of thousands and a rebooting of this economy but we have a Government which is wedded to the financial markets system and which puts itself and our people at the mercy of the speculators. Does anybody believe the speculators and the financial markets will take seriously that this State is rocketing forward economically? I fully expect that the sharks will begin to circle again in a year or two years as the reality of the disaster that is austerity becomes clear. The Government is relying on a discredited system and is condemning youth and working class people to ongoing despair and difficulty. That is why I am committed to socialist policies and to the socialist transformation of society where wealth is in democratic ownership, in public ownership, as the financial institutions should be, and to utilising the wealth and resources to rectify the problems and for major infrastructural and other investment to create jobs for our people and to transform life for our people by contrast with this disaster which is occurring currently.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	I thank Deputies for their considered and useful contributions today and last week. During the course of this Second Stage debate, a number of Deputies raised the future prospects of the Irish economy and Irish society. The Government is acutely aware of the challenges the Irish people have faced over the past few years and the resolute way they have faced them. The difficult decisions that have been taken are bearing fruit. The public finances have been put on a sustainable path and the economy is being rebalanced. However, more work needs to be done. For this reason, with Government agreement, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are drawing up a medium-term economic strategy to cover the period from 2014 to 2020. The Government's focus is firmly fixed on achieving a successful and durable exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance, which runs until December of this year. It is doing all it can to this end. All options that assist in supporting durable and sustainable future market funding will be considered in light of what is appropriate for Ireland. I am aware of the concerns some consumers may have about the domestic banking landscape. Deputies should be aware that under the provisions of section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, regulated financial institutions must apply to the Central Bank for permission if they wish to increase charges and fees. A number of Deputies spoke about the local property tax, which does not fall within the scope of this Bill. I reiterate that there is no requirement on any property owner to pay the local property tax for 2014 before 1 January 2014. I can absolutely state that no penalties will apply if a person does not pay before then, as the tax is not due until 1 January next. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that other specific issues which were raised by Deputies during this Second Stage debate are not primarily the responsibility of my Department. Therefore, I cannot address them in this reply. I would like to respond to some specific points that were made about the Bill. Some Deputies referred to the decision to replace the one-parent family tax credit with the single person child carer tax credit. They sought to portray this as an attack on separated fathers. Ultimately, the number of single fathers affected by this measure will depend on the family circumstances in each case. This cannot be described as an attack on single fathers. It is important to point out that the child benefit payment will not be the determining factor in deciding who can claim the new tax credit. That payment is being used as the initial indicator to ease the transition from the old credit to the new. It should be noted that this new policy has been agreed by the Government on the basis of the Commission on Taxation's recommendation that the credit should be retained, but should be confined to the principal carer only. As I outlined in my opening speech, I intend to propose a Committee Stage amendment to provide that the new credit can assist the non-primary carer to take up or remain in employment where the primary carer has no tax liability. A number of Deputies referred to the budget decision to restrict tax relief in respect of medical insurance premiums. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on 2012 data, it is estimated that up to 577,000 policy holders, which equates to almost 53% of all policies, may be affected by this measure. Of those that are affected, many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase. Deputy Lawlor mentioned the sportspersons relief. I want to be clear about this issue. Following the concerns raised by the European Commission, we had two options. We could choose to extend the relief to allow sportspersons to live in another European Union or European Free Trade Association country, or choose to abolish it altogether. Deputy Michael McGrath suggested that the home renovation incentive is too cumbersome for individuals. The incentive is designed to be very easy to claim. All claims are handled online through the Revenue website. Deputy Lawlor asked whether invoices can be accumulated to reach the €5,000 threshold under the home renovation incentive. The threshold can be reached by carrying out several jobs. It does not have to result from a single job. Therefore, any qualifying job undertaken can be included to reach the €5,000 threshold. I acknowledge that Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy Pearse Doherty both welcomed the change introduced in section 38 of the Bill to ensure Irish companies cannot be "stateless" for the purpose of their tax residence. I welcome Deputy Michael McGrath's positive response to the enhancements to the research and development tax credit that I have announced. These enhancements include the phasing out of the base year when resources allow. Deputies Michael McGrath, Shortall, Mitchell and McDonald made a number of comments about my dealings with the pensions sector and the additional 0.15% pension fund levy that will apply to pension fund assets next year and in 2015. I acknowledge Deputy McGrath's welcome for the changes being made to the standard fund threshold regime. However, I must correct one misapprehension that he and others seem to be under. It has been suggested that individuals in the public service have been singled out for preferential treatment under the regime. This is incorrect. The changes to the standard fund threshold regime apply, as appropriate, to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. I would not categorise my engagement with the pensions sector on the proposed changes to the standard fund threshold regime as a "bargain", in the manner suggested. The assessment that the changes to the regime required to deliver on the budget 2013 commitment to cap taxpayer subsidies to higher value pensions would have a considerably lower yield than originally estimated meant that the achievement of our overall budgetary objectives, including the continuation of the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector which the Deputy and many others have rightly welcomed, necessitated among other things the imposition of the additional 0.15% pension fund levy for 2014 and 2015. Deputy Shortall pointed out that the levy does not apply to unfunded public service pension schemes. While this is the case, of course, she omitted to mention that public service pensions above €12,000 per annum have been cut by an average of 4% since 2011 by means of the public service pension reduction, with much more severe cuts at higher pension levels. Deputy Michael McGrath accused me of penalising and not incentivising pension savings. He quoted figures from the Irish Brokers Association in this regard. That association and other groups have made it clear to me previously that the most significant incentive to pension savings is the marginal rate tax relief on pension contributions, which I am maintaining. Deputy Pearse Doherty said that I blindly accepted the pensions sector proposals for their changes to the standard fund threshold regime and the yield associated with those changes. This is clearly incorrect. Deputies Michael McGrath, Boyd Barrett and Simon Harris referred to the capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs which I announced in budget 2014. In light of the required increases in capital gains tax rates over recent years, and the need to encourage entrepreneurship in the economy, there is a case for a targeted and time-bound capital gains tax relief to encourage investment in assets used in specified new trading activities which would give rise to economic benefits and employment. DIRT was mentioned by several Deputies. In certain cases, deposit interest can be paid without deduction of DIRT or individuals can get a refund of DIRT deducted. There is no exemption for children. One Deputy mentioned accounts owned by children in credit unions, but there is no reason such accounts should be treated differently from accounts held by children in other financial institutions. I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Finance Bill provisions relating to real estate investment trusts do not involve any policy changes. They are purely technical changes intended to correct minor errors in the legislation enacted earlier this year. While I note the Deputy's comments in relation to section 33, I strongly refute his characterisation of this measure as a bailout of the banks. The removal of this restriction will serve to level the playing field between participating institutions and other companies. Deputies Pearse Doherty, McLellan, Nash and Deasy raised issues concerning the living city initiative, which was announced earlier this year as part of the Finance Bill 2013. I said at the time that the proposed scheme would be subject to a full ex ante cost-benefit analysis and would require EU state aid approval from the European Commission. Following the receipt of a report, an application for EU state aid approval will be submitted shortly to the European Commission. The evidence presented in the cost-benefit analysis will form part of this application. Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned that the Government announced a reduction in the air travel tax in July 2011. He suggested that we did not follow through on it. The July 2011 announcement was subject to agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers. Such an agreement was not forthcoming. I have been heartened by the response of Ryanair to last month's budgetary announcement. Deputy Pearse Doherty argued that the increase in excise duty on alcohol is a revenue-raising measure. It is estimated that these increases will raise €145 million in 2014. This has helped me to retain the lower rate of VAT for the tourism sector. I point out that the percentage of excise on a pint of beer is less than it was ten years ago in 2003.Deputy Doherty also stated that the extension of betting duty to remote operators would raise €20 million in a full year. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 was published in July. Deputies will be aware that under the technical standards directive, the EU Commission had to be consulted about the Bill following its publication and this led to a standstill period of a minimum of three months. It is my intention, subject to agreement with the Whips, to progress the Bill in this session. I acknowledge the references made by many Deputies from both sides of the House to the retention of the 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism-related services. The outcome has been very positive with an estimated 15,000 additional jobs created in the sector. I am therefore happy to confirm the retention of this arrangement under the Finance Bill which, in tandem with the reduction of the air travel tax to zero, will reinforce and build on the progress already achieved in the important hospitality sector of the economy. Various Deputies raised the issue of changes to the income tax pay and file arrangements. I am aware of the concerns that have been raised by various stakeholders and have recently completed a consultation process on this very issue. Unfortunately time does not permit me to address all the issues raised during our debate here and as I mentioned in my opening statement there are still a small number of matters under consideration for inclusion by way of amendment on Committee Stage. I thank my colleagues for their very constructive contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.

The recent decisions of Danske Bank and ACC Bank once again place in sharp focus the perilous state of business banking in Ireland. However, anybody in business does not need to be reminded of how serious the situation regarding SME credit and support for business is. The Danske Bank and ACC Bank developments are bad for business confidence and the wider economy and follow the loss of Halifax, Postbank, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide and EBS, which was folded in to AIB. On a more positive note, we welcome the expansion of KBC Bank and the ambition of Permanent TSB to be a strong retail bank following the submission of its restructuring plan to the European Commission. Ulster Bank has recently announced that much of its Irish business will be put into an internally managed "bad" bank. It had been feared that Ulster Bank might decide to leave the Irish market entirely so it is welcome that RBS said Ulster Bank was an important business for the whole island of Ireland and added that it wanted to ensure it had a viable business model.  As the banking market has contracted, the dominance of two pillar banks - Bank of Ireland and AIB - is returning to levels last seen in the 1980s. As a result of the loss of competition, the two pillar banks now command approximately 70% of the current account market. That is not a healthy development in any market. The lack of competition is leading to higher fees and charges, lower interest rates on deposits, high borrowing costs, a full-scale withdrawal of banking services in many communities, a restriction on services in others and a complete lack of innovative product choice. The small and medium enterprise, SME, community, in particular, is bearing the brunt of higher charges. Charges for coin lodgements have increased substantially in recent years. Some banks even restrict the days on which one can lodge coin in their various branches, such is their lack of regard for the realities of modern day business. The president of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, Eamonn Kielty, put it succinctly when he said last week: "A normal competitive banking market no longer exists in Ireland, and currently the banks are primarily concerned with self-preservation and deleveraging. As foreign banks exit stage left, the remaining bailed-out two will no doubt take advantage of the lack of competition to hike up their charges." That is representative of the views of those who are at the coalface every day. Against this background, there is huge uncertainty within the banking sector in Ireland at present. It is our contention that the proposal before the House would serve to inject confidence to the banking market and the country generally, and would demonstrate a major statement of intent on behalf of the Government in terms of our economic recovery. A State enterprise bank, similar to those in Canada, the US and Germany and the model currently under development in the UK, should be considered for the provision of capital to growing businesses. There is a commitment to this notion in the programme for Government. Instead of long fingering this, the Government must act now and honour that commitment more than two and a half years into its term. An enterprise bank could be a permanent solution to the lending gap which exists in Irish banking. It would lend to any company, regardless of sector or size, provided it demonstrated its creditworthiness. It would remain in State ownership even after the State had sold its stake in the pillar banks. An enterprise bank should have the following features. It should focus on smallscale lending up to €5 million. It would not seek to compete directly with existing banks in a way that would crowd them out, but provide a complementary source of finance. Funding decisions should be taken based on a rigorous assessment of a company's future prospects. Loans would not represent grant aid but would be soundly based on viable business plans. It should provide advice to borrowers in a way that assists the development of their business and benefits the wider economy. The establishment of an enterprise bank would be recognition of the importance of the SME sector to the economy and its recovery. SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy, representing nearly 99% of active enterprise, 70% of all employment in the State and 46% of gross value added in the economy. The domestic SME sector is diverse in nature and employs workers with a much wider range of skills that the multinational sector. SMEs can range from the smallest business to local supermarkets and enterprises employing less than 50 people. Our jobs crisis cannot be solved in its entirety by focusing on foreign direct investment alone. By supporting the SME sector we are ensuring job opportunities for those with traditional skills as well as for people with high tech qualifications. The Government has sought to roll out a series of SME-friendly initiatives and we have welcomed that. We also support the Taoiseach's aspiration that Ireland will be the best place in the world in which to do business by 2016. However, this will not happen while we have an impaired credit market. We do not support initiatives such as the changes in employers' PRSI, which will cost small business €22 million next year, and the abolition of the redundancy rebate. These initiatives will seriously add to the problems SMEs face in cash management. Earlier this year Fiona Muldoon, the Central Bank's director of credit institutions, disclosed that half of the €50 billion in loans outstanding to the SME sector were non-performing. Many of the loans are backed by personal guarantees, meaning businesses and potential entrepreneurs are still trying to come terms with their debt. This is an issue on which the Central Bank must act urgently. There are many excellent and viable businesses which are important employers and contributors to their local economies, but which are being dragged down because of legacy debt. They can service their day-to-day business and financial requirements, but cannot service the legacy debt at this time. Given the chance to grow their business and get through this period, many of them will be in a position to service that legacy debt in a number of years. There must be an urgent and targeted initiative on the part of the Central Bank to assist these viable businesses and allow them to maintain employment and services in their communities, while at the same time negotiating with them to address that debt at a future time. This is exactly the type of role an enterprise-focused bank can have. It could roll out such an initiative. The OECD, in its report on Ireland, noted that the banks have met the targets set by the Government for lending to SMEs. However, it found that two thirds of new SME lending is just rolled over on existing loans, while the overall stock of lending to SMEs is substantially declining. That proves what we all know from our daily interaction with people. New lending is actually overdrafts being converted to term loans, often without any notice to the borrower, or various limits being changed around into different products which are higher margin for the bank but more expensive to the customer. Central Bank lending statistics support this. They show that lending to non-financial or property-related small and medium enterprises was down by 1.4% between April and June, compared to the same period a year earlier, with the amount of credit outstanding to the sector now €1.5 billion less than at the same time in 2012. Yes, that represents a pay down of facilities but also, in many cases, a famine of credit facilities. ISME's latest quarterly survey published in September found that 57% of companies that applied for funding in the last three months had been refused credit by their banks, compared with a 44% rejection rate in the last quarterly survey. On average, the decision time has increased from four to five weeks. That is if the application was submitted. A total of 30% of respondents had increases in bank charges imposed during a lending process, while 11% suffered increased interest. Reductions in overdrafts were demanded of 31% of SMEs, up from 28% in the previous quarter. A steady 95% of respondents to the survey, people at the coal face, state that the Government is having either a negative or no impact on SME lending. While 55% of respondents are aware of the credit guarantee scheme, only 28% know about the microfinance scheme, down from 37% in the previous quarter. I will refer to those two schemes later. A report by Bain & Company and the Institute of International Finance into European SME financing found an 82% drop in SME lending in Ireland, which was considerably worse than the other five European countries analysed. They included Portugal and Spain, two peripheral eurozone countries that, like Ireland, have had to rely on outside financial help. It also found that Irish SMEs are paying interest rates up to three times higher for lending than their German counterparts. Finally, the Credit Review Office found in its 12th progress report, published in late September, that while the pillar banks continue to lend to low-to-medium risk credit applications, credit conditions remain tight overall and appeal requests are rising. That is a welcome initiative, but it shows the difficulties on the ground. The Government will dispute these figures, but they are from the coalface. The ISME survey involved the men and women who every day must worry about how they are going to keep the doors of their businesses open and how they are going to pay the wages for their staff at the end of the month. Many of them pay their staff wages but do not take a wage themselves. They also worry about how to keep the Revenue Commissioners happy for another month. These are the people which banks leave waiting for five to seven weeks at a time. In anticipation of these figures being disputed by the Government, the motion calls for an independent review of how the pillar banks are meeting their targets. If they are supposed to be lending €400 million to SMEs, show us and an independent person where it is going. I referred to some of the initiatives started by the Government. The Microenterprise Loan Fund during its first year of existence lent €1.62 million. At the time of its launch in October 2012, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said it would lend €40 million over five years, create 7,700 jobs and lend money to 5,500 businesses. We had a very good exchange with Microfinance Ireland earlier today at a meeting of the enterprise and jobs committee. It is working hard but its representatives stated clearly that microfinance is not a panacea to the credit crisis and it should not be seen as such. I hope Government Deputies noted that. The seed and venture capital scheme was launched by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to encourage venture capitalists to invest in companies that find it hard to raise money in their early years, such as technology start-ups. The Minister was hoping to invest €175 million into the scheme to leverage an additional €525 million from private investors. The "first of several calls for investment", to quote the advertisement, was made on 31 May and investors had until the end of June to express an interest.Money has not yet been allocated under the scheme, despite this being the sector on which the Government is pinning so many of its economic recovery hopes. The €450 million credit guarantee scheme, which has been up and running for approximately one year, offers a 75% State guarantee to banks against the losses on loans given to particular businesses. It was expected, and we were told, that it would provide an additional €150 million per year in lending for small businesses. In its first ten months, it has loaned only €8.5 million, with 393 additional jobs created and 119 jobs protected. This is so bad that the Government is reviewing the scheme a year into its operation. We have many schemes and a great deal of spin, but we have very little extra credit or employment. We are more than half way through the life of this Government. Is it serious about the commitment made in the programme for Government? The Government parties are great at claiming that manifesto commitments are only manifesto commitments. To cite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, they are the kind of commitments one makes during an election. However, this commitment made it through to the programme for Government. It is the type of operation that will take time to establish. If the Government is serious about setting up an investment bank, it will commit to a timescale this evening. The Labour Deputies are absent this evening. Perhaps they are modelling somewhere. Along with them, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, championed the cause of an investment bank during the time of the former Government.

That promise is gone. Will the investment bank and enterprise bank promises go the same way? If so, the Government should say so now instead of tabling a flim-flam amendment that expresses nothing of the reality being experienced by SME owners. If the Government is serious about SMEs and making them a part of the recovery that is under way, they must be given finance. If the Government wants to leave them behind, it will vote down this motion tomorrow night.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	389	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this debate, the importance of which is the reason Fianna Fáil decided to dedicate its Private Members' time to the issues of lending and the establishment of a State-owned, SME-focused new enterprise bank. The debate's starting point is to acknowledge that we have a real problem. If we do not acknowledge the problem with availability of credit in the economy, we will not solve it. Access to credit is to an economy what fuel is to a car. One cannot have a properly functioning economy unless one has an adequate supply of credit. We can debate this matter all night, but if one speaks with business people who rely on credit from financial institutions, one will be given the consistent message that credit conditions remain extremely difficult. Whenever I speak with a business person, I ask about the main challenges facing him or her. Credit is always in the top three. The other two are generally issues of compliance and red tape and the cost of doing business, for example, local authority rates, energy costs and so forth. Almost without exception, credit and finance are key issues for businesses, particularly in the SME community. Through various statistics, Deputy Calleary outlined the importance of SMEs to the economy. We all acknowledge that they will be the driver of Ireland's economic recovery. We love to hear of multinationals coming to Ireland and would like to see many more of them, but it is now rare to hear of a multinational coming to Ireland and announcing 700 or 800 new jobs, themselves leading to spin-off jobs. The IDA will need to continue working on that side of the economy, and the best of luck to it, but our onus is to focus on SMEs, particularly in terms of credit. The Government refers to lending targets. The two pillar banks must meet a target of €4 billion each in 2013. They claim they will do so and, upon examination, the Credit Review Office, CRO, asserts that they are on course to meet their targets, but Deputy Calleary is right. In many ways, it is a phony debate. At least two thirds of the composition of the €4 billion per bank will involve refinancing and rolling over existing credit. There is nothing wrong with refinancing existing credit or rolling over loans, as it remains credit and forms an important part of the economy, but it is not new credit and we should not measure it as such. The CRO's latest report made it clear that, in many respects, the €8 billion target for AIB and Bank of Ireland is a false one, as no one is suggesting the economy needs anything near new lending of €8 billion to the SME sector. In the report, Mr. John Trethowan pointed to the argument that, if new lending of €8 billion per annum were to be achieved, it would require a lending-borrowing rate of approximately twice that of the EU's most successful economy, Germany, on a like-for-like scale basis. Let us have a real debate. Let us set targets for new lending - not approvals, but the drawing down of new credit. This debate has been kicked around for the past two or three years. The banks are meeting their targets. Some of that is repackaging existing credit, with a small element of new credit. Can we not once and for all agree on the definition of what constitutes a lending target and have the banks independently assessed, perhaps by the CRO, to ensure the targets are being achieved? This would be critical. Many SMEs are cautious about taking on new debt and many loan offers are not being drawn down. This is for a number of reasons. SMEs got burned by property investments, many of which have contaminated good trading businesses. When approvals are given, often after a long time, they come with such onerous terms and conditions and punitive interest rates that drawing down the credit would not be sustainable for the businesses in question. Many of those approvals come with demands for personal guarantees, which many people are not prepared to give for obvious reasons. They have seen the consequences for those who made personal guarantees in recent years in respect of property investments. We must accept that there is a distinct lack of competition in Ireland's banking sector. Deputy Calleary referred to a number of the banks that have left Ireland or have signalled they are about to leave, including ACC Bank, which will hand back its banking licence. There have been some positives, for example, the expansion of KBC. Investec, a welcome and relatively new entrant to Ireland in recent years, has indicated it will enter the mortgage market. We badly need competition in that sector. Ireland must be primed for new entrants to the banking sector. I am referring to entrants with clean balance sheets and that are not burdened by historical tracker mortgages, which are dragging down a number of our domestic banks. These new entrants would not have been burned by Ireland's property experiment. If the banks that operate internationally shared the Government's confidence in the future of the Irish economy, I would expect more of them to want to enter our market and offer personal customers and SMEs products and services. I hope the Government is actively trying to attract to Ireland banks that, importantly, are not burdened by the legacy issues of tracker mortgages and property loans. I have mentioned the pillar banks' targets. A frustration for many business people relates to the discretion that was historically found in local branches. People used to talk to and build personal relationships with bank managers who knew the businesses in question intimately. Nowadays, a manager does not appear to have any power. Virtually no significant lending decision is made at the branch level. It is passed up to head office where it goes through a risk assessment process. This is a weakness in how the banking system has developed. Power and discretion always existed at local level, where the people involved in making the decisions knew the businesses and the people running them well, had established trust and built relationships.That seems to have been demolished due to the experience of recent times. It is frustrating for business people who are seeking loans. Comments have been made about why the number of cases going to the Credit Review Office is so low. I would argue it is because business people can only go to the CRO after they have exhausted all the internal channels within a bank. They must first make a formal loan application, which takes time and is onerous. They have to receive a decision on that application and must then exhaust the bank's internal appeal procedures. It is only when their appeal has been refused that they can go to the Credit Review Office. In many instances, however, the request for credit is quite urgent so people in business cannot wait for the process to conclude before taking a case to the CRO. The Government should examine that issue. Surely it should be sufficient that if a bank refuses an application, a person can go directly to the CRO. I welcome the recent budget increase to €3 million in the threshold limit for loans that can be considered by the CRO. That is an important step and it is to be hoped we will see more work going to the CRO. The Government must ensure Ulster Bank is brought under the remit of the Credit Review Office. At the moment, the CRO's remit covers AIB and Bank of Ireland. People who have commercial loans with Permanent TSB, which experimented in that market, do not have the right to go to the Credit Review Office. That issue needs to be addressed. The significant reduction in competition in the Irish banking sector has consequences for customers by way of increased fees and charges, reduced interest rates on deposits, and higher rates of interest on loans for personal customers and SMEs. We need to have two fundamental aspects to our approach to banking. The first is regulation, which was deficient in the past and we all acknowledge that. The second and equally important pillar is competition. Much more work must be done by the Government in that respect. Allied to that, the Central Bank must do much more to protect consumers, given its regulatory role. The Central Bank is not there just to supervise the banking system prudentially and ensure the checklist of regulations is being ticked. It is also there to protect consumers, so I want to see the Central Bank being more prominent in that role. Our motion alluded to moneylending. I acknowledge that licensed moneylenders are operating a legitimate business and are regulated by the Central Bank. A recent report showed a 20% increase in recent years in the number of those availing of moneylenders' services. Some 360,000 people owe approximately €200 million. The study found that about one quarter of them have at one stage got into serous difficulties in repaying those loans. That tells us something about the state of the economy, of which we are all acutely aware. In addition, that so many people have had to turn to moneylenders means that traditional providers of credit in the economy, such as banks and credit unions, have not been able to supply the credit required. There are without doubt people who should not get any more credit. They would like to draw down loans they can never afford to repay based on their income. Banks must be prudent and protect the capital that taxpayers have given to them, but there is undoubtedly an issue concerning the contraction of lending. Above all else, we want to see a new enterprise bank which is focused on SMEs. The Minister's amendment acknowledges that the Government promised a strategic investment bank to provide finance for large capital projects, a conduit for venture capital and a lender to SMEs. As a precursor to that, the Minister has established the strategic investment fund, although we have yet to see the legislation to provide for a reorientation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to channel some money towards the strategic investment fund. A greater priority for the economy is the issue of SME lending. If we can agree on one thing, it should be that the engine of recovery will be SMEs. They are certainly starved of cash and many of them find it exceptionally difficult to obtain credit. That issue will have to be addressed. The banks seem to have swung from one extreme to the other. Seven or eight years ago, they were throwing money at people, as it were, and seemed to have no concept of risk assessment. They took substantial risks in putting all their eggs into the property basket and we have all witnessed the outcome for the banking system and the country. Banks appear to have gone to the other extreme now, being risk averse and unwilling to take any chance in respect of trading businesses. This even includes businesses with which the banks have built up a strong relationship over the years. Banks have been consistently restricting overdrafts in recent times. I acknowledge that the troika programme contains strict targets for banks to meet in terms of repairing their balance sheets, rebuilding their loan-to-deposit ratios, and deleveraging non-core assets. All that has percolated its way down to individual SME customers. It has meant that banks are less inclined to give out more credit or have been aggressively targeting deposits in an effort to rebuild those ratios. That is what the banks are doing and there seems to be no reward or incentive for them to give out new credit.  If the Minister does not believe what we are saying, he should listen to those at the coalface. Deputy Calleary referred to ISME's recent quarterly report on lending which reads:Despite assertions from the banking PR machine, access to credit is abysmal. The application process is getting more tortuous while zealous bankers terrorise owners of small and medium businesses with legal letters of foreclosure, rather than negotiate an economic settlement.One can accuse Mr. Mark Fielding, the CEO of ISME, of exaggeration but he is representing thousands of business people. I have heard none of them contradict what he has consistently said about credit. I know the Minister will not accept our motion but I hope he will accept the need for a new SME-focused enterprise bank. The Government should start doing some detailed work on that issue to see how it can be established and what the mechanics are. The Government should accept that such a bank could play an important role in the recovery of the economy.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. It is fair to say that for some time the Government has not sponsored a genuine debate in this House on the plight of the SME sector. It is fitting that my colleagues, Deputy Dara Calleary and Deputy Michael McGrath, have taken this opportunity to articulate the many problems being faced by SME companies and employers. It has been rightly pointed out that this is a commitment in the programme for Government. For a change, we are not holding the Minister to account for doing a U-turn or breaking a promise. Instead we are asking him to live up to what is in the programme for Government. We must acknowledge at the outset that there is a problem. Any SME will confirm that there is a severe shortage of credit lines. If companies do not have credit facilities, they do not have blood flowing through their commercial veins and so their businesses will die. That must be the starting point. The consequences of less credit include less turnover, less choice for customers, less competition and less employment. In addition, there will be less business in our cities, towns and villages. We are seeing many SMEs dying on their feet, so to speak, with businesses closing down, particularly in city centres. In my city of Limerick, the business core has been hollowed out. Similarly, many towns and villages have been hollowed out as businesses have closed. The banking landscape has changed with the pull out of Danske Bank, ACC, Halifax and PostBank, as well as Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide and EBS.We must be grateful for Ulster Bank's commitment to the Irish economy and the recently announced expansion of KBC. I welcome the opening of its regional headquarters in O'Connell Street in Limerick, which was badly needed. It is worrying that the two pillar banks comprise almost 70% of the market. This means we do not have competition or choice. We all know the consequences of a lack of competition and choice, namely, higher fees, higher interest rates and higher bank charges, all of which put pressure on SMEs and erode confidence. We all also know that the pyramid and structure upon which business is built is credit and confidence. Confidence in the marketplace is as important as credit. Our SMEs account for 90% of our active enterprise and up to 70% of employment throughout the country. This puts into context the reason SMEs need to move further up this Government's list of priorities. Sadly, from the feedback which I and other Members from all sides of the House are receiving, they do not rank as a priority.  It was worrying to read in this morning's Irish Independent that up to one quarter of our credit unions may be severely restricted and are on what has been termed "a watch list". We all know what happened in regard to Newbridge credit union. It is very worrying that up to one quarter of our total stock of credit unions have a problem.  Another issue is the serious impact the black economy is having on the SME sector. Retail Ireland says that up to €900 million per annum, almost €1 billion, is the cost and impact of the black economy on our SME sector. The SME sector is struggling owing to a lack of credit and must also compete with operators in the black economy. This issue must be addressed by Government as soon as possible. Another area under the direct supervision of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is the roll-out of Irish Water. Particularly disturbing for businesses is spiralling water charges under the watch of local authorities. It is reprehensible that local authorities are not accountable to this House through the Committee of Public Accounts. The Government needs to look at issues such as charges on business by local authorities in terms of commercial rates and water charges and, on the other hand, waste within our local authorities, which are not scrutinised by this House. The establishment of Irish Water will be a significant cost factor for business. The Government does not propose to amend the Freedom of Information Act to include Irish Water which will take over the water infrastructure and heap significant charges onto business, which is a disgrace. Business and the public are entitled to expect openness and transparency in terms of the charging structure and the roll-up of costs in respect of Irish Water, how contracts were awarded and so on but this information will not be available to Members of this House or members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act. The Government also needs to review utility charges for businesses, which have spiralled over the past number of years. There is a need for significant promotion of alternative sources of energy, including wind, solar and wave energy. The Shannon estuary in the mid-west where I live could be used to provide wave energy. Many reports on this issue have been published but remain on shelves. The industrial and commercial energy demands of the mid-west could be sourced from wave energy. The Government needs to ensure access to credit and to think outside the box in terms of alleviating pressures and costs on the SME sector.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	I thank Fianna Fáil and, in particular, Deputy Niall Collins, for allowing me some of his time to contribute to this important debate. I also thank Fianna Fáil for bringing this motion before the House. It is vitally important we debate the financing of small business. An SME-focused new bank would be a worthwhile venture. I speak on this issue as someone who has been involved in small business for many years. I was 17 years old the first time I borrowed money from a bank. I have been borrowing ever since. I know the importance and value of being able to borrow money. We have come full circle in that the banks who were throwing money at individuals and businesses in the past are no longer lending. It is not true to say that there is money available to small businesses. I know from personal experience that it is not. Decisions being taken by this Government are detrimental to small businesses. I will give an example. We are all against smoking. The plain packaging proposal by this Government will lead to job losses in that people who up to now purchased their cigarettes in shops will now buy them on the black market. I have no doubt that the number of people purchasing illegal cigarettes will increase and that the footfall for shops will decrease, resulting in job losses. I am 100% sure of that. Other decisions are being taken by this Government which are detrimental to small business. For example, the HSE, in terms of its being over-anxious with inspections, is not doing anything to help small businesses. Most of the people involved in food preparation have been doing so all their lives. They know what needs to be done and the standards that must be met yet inspectors are breathing down their necks every hour of the day and night and insisting on all types of paperwork being available at all times. This is putting an additional burden of cost on small businesses.  A new bank that would focus on SMEs is a worthwhile proposal. I compliment Fianna Fail on bringing the proposal forward. 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	I move amendment No. 2:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:“notes that, in order to ensure an adequate flow of credit to viable companies, this Government in 2011 imposed challenging targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for lending to small and medium businesses, and continues to monitor the banks’ progress in meeting these targets;acknowledges that the Credit Review Office is available to businesses refused credit by Bank of Ireland and AIB and has overturned over half of the cases referred to it and encourages businesses to use this important facility;notes that:— both AIB and Bank of Ireland have stated that they have set aside €2 billion each for new mortgage lending in 2013, while Permanent TSB has indicated that it is prepared to lend over €300 million in this area; and— this Government inherited an economy with a severely impaired banking system but has moved to ensure, through the implementation of effective policies to promote economic growth, that Ireland remains an attractive location in which foreign banks can operate;acknowledges that, while the number of consumers choosing to make use of the services offered by licensed moneylenders has increased by 20% since 2005, the majority of moneylenders’ customers reported high satisfaction levels regarding service and believe that they are treated fairly when in arrears;notes that:— moneylenders are licensed and regulated by the recently-strengthened Central Bank and that consumers continue to be protected by the Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders; and— Ireland is leading the dialogue across Europe on how best to expand market-based non-bank financing and that the recent budget included initiatives to encourage equity investment in Irish businesses;further acknowledges that:— the programme for Government contains a clear commitment to creating a strategic investment bank that will become a provider of finance to large capital projects, a conduit for venture capital, and a lender to small and medium enterprises, SMEs; and— while the Government’s priority at present is the creation of the Irish strategic investment fund and the reorganisation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which can make investments more quickly than would be possible were the Government to establish a bank for this purpose, it is intended, in parallel, that the strategic investment bank concept will be further considered;recognises that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing; accepts that SMEs are the engines of economic growth providing over two thirds of employment in the State and that the Government has charged the SME State bodies group with the task of implementing initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of Irish businesses for access to a wide range of bank and non-bank finance as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs;further recognises that Ireland, in the course of its recent Presidency of the European Union, played a key role leading the debate at EU level to ensure that banks in Europe will be well regulated, well capitalised and sufficiently robust to withstand economic cycles;notes that a number of significant legislative reforms have been undertaken since the financial crisis aimed at building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and responding to the pre-existing shortcomings that had been identified in our system of financial regulation;further notes that these legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and powers; andnotes that section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, provides that credit institutions and bureaux de change must notify the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer "charge" for providing a service or increase any existing customer "charge" for providing a service.”I wish to share time with Deputies Dominic Hannigan and Tom Barry. As the Government's counter-motion makes clear there can be no doubt that the legacy issues facing this country, its people and its enterprises are serious in nature and many in number. However, it should also be clear that this Government has moved to tackle these issues head on, both at home and with its partners in Europe. Furthermore, the Government continues to make all efforts to strengthen our economy through encouraging business, improving regulation of our banking system and ensuring that Ireland and its people are served by financial institutions that add value to the economy. It is the Government's vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. Therefore, credit availability for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. The working capital requirements of many SMEs are often fulfilled by short-term credit in the form of overdrafts or short-term loans.Additionally, the Government has imposed challenging SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion in 2012 and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets and a recent Credit Review Office quarterly report commented that both banks are on track to achieve their €4 billion loan sanction targets, assuming the pattern of previous years of a strong fourth quarter performance is repeated. It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed. The Credit Review Office was established to help SME or farm borrowers who have had an application for credit declined or reduced, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes. The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases, or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in €18.5 million in credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. This shows that there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the Credit Review Office and SMEs refused credit are strongly encouraged to seek a review by the office. I introduced a number of measures in the budget for funding growth in the SME sector. There is to be a substantial increase in the upper limit for loan applications that can be appealed to the Credit Review Office, from €0.5 million to €3 million, to facilitate requests from a broader range of SMEs. The level of awareness among SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full €2 billion suite of developmental business supports remains low. In order to address this, a comprehensive communication strategy will be rolled out in the coming months. To improve the framework of credit supports available to SMEs, a subsidised financial training programme for small businesses is being introduced, consisting of two days dedicated off-site training, together with expert mentoring support. Work will be undertaken with the European Investment Bank to develop a tailored and customised trade finance initiative to support the growth of the export sector, providing much needed finance to exporters and restore confidence, support trade and foster growth and employment. We will address specific challenges of funding international trade through a broader suite of financial products. These initiatives form part of an existing suite of measures to assist the SME sector. Enterprise Ireland offers a range of schemes to small businesses and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has introduced the credit guarantee scheme and the microenterprise business lending scheme. We are able to tailor our policies to the needs of the SMEs as we actively listen to the enterprise community and react where we see the need for and possibility of government intervention. The Department of Finance commissions biannual surveys of the demand for credit from SMEs. The results inform and guide the Government's policy on securing and maintaining the availability of credit to SMEs. The survey results also provide useful information to the banks, SME representative organisations and individual SMEs, as well as the Credit Review Office on what they can do to assist in the flow of credit to viable businesses. Another benefit of these surveys is that they assist in clarifying the often conflicting perspectives presented in respect of the availability of credit and the actual demand for credit among this important sector of the economy. The National Treasury Management Agency and in particular, the National Pension Reserve Fund, have been activated to help funding into the real economy. In many cases they are in partnership with private sector investors. To date, the NPRF has established the following: the SME equity fund will focus on investing in healthy businesses seeking to grow, including those with overleveraged balance sheets. This fund involves a contribution from the NPRF of €125 million with an ultimate fund size of €350 million. The SME credit fund
will lend to larger SMEs and mid-size corporates and will be managed by BlueBay Asset Management. It aims to leverage €175 million of NTMA funds ultimately to provide €450 million to the market. The SME turnaround fund
will invest in underperforming businesses which are at or close to the point of insolvency but have the potential for financial and operational restructuring. This has €50 million of Government backed funding, with a total fund size of €100 million. The National Pensions Reserve Fund has also been working closely with Enterprise Ireland and the Department of the Taoiseach to assist in setting up the Innovation Fund Ireland,
a €500 million Government initiative designed to attract leading international venture capital fund managers to Ireland. The recent decisions by ACC and Danske Bank to withdraw from the Irish banking market were disappointing, following the withdrawal of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) some time ago. It is consistent with a trend evident through the course of the financial crisis of retrenchment to national borders. Banks operating in Ireland allocate significant resources to restructuring, cost savings, re-engineering processes and products, managing their legacy portfolio and dealing with customers in difficulty. Justification of such investment is clearly challenging for institutions also facing difficulties in their home markets, much in the same way it was difficult for Irish banks in difficulty to justify maintaining their operations abroad. One of our expectations from the financial crisis is that market shares in traditional banking services will become more fluid during the recovery, as the banking landscape continues to adjust to the withdrawal of foreign players, the restructuring of our incumbent banks and the increasing price transparency within financial services. We expect that over time, this will present opportunities in the market for the entry of new market participants well positioned to be confident in the future profitability of an Irish branch or subsidiary. While the current market may not be attractive to a fully diversified bank challenger in the short term, I would expect new financial services providers to enter the market on a more targeted basis, such as specialised lenders and non-bank finance providers. This Government has been working hard to create an environment conducive to the entry of such new entrants through a number of initiatives and have been leading the debate at EU level on the mechanisms to promote alternative forms of financing for SMEs. It is important that we establish a level playing field for all banks if they will be willing to enter the Irish market and compete. In this regard, we are working to manage and minimise potential market expectations of future State support for the State owned banks which could act as a deterrent to new market entrants. We are working to establish a level playing field in the assessment of credit risk through the establishment of an industry wide credit register to allow for the appropriate measures of risk in lending, allowing incumbent and new lenders to lend with full visibility of the risk of that lending. We are working to reduce switching costs to allow customers to move between banks more easily, enhancing competition and forcing banks to work hard to retain their customers on a commercial basis. We are encouraging risk sharing partnerships to encourage new lending, such as the AIB-European Investment Bank lending initiative. We are in regular dialogue with potential market entrants as they evaluate potential opportunities in Ireland and we will be supportive of new entrants as they emerge. There is little doubt that the recent bank exits will have an effect on the level of competition in the Irish financial sector. However, the banks are commercial entities independent of the Government; they make decisions on the conduct of their business separately to the considerations of the State and have the right to conduct their business as they consider appropriate. Nonetheless, the banks continue to be regulated by the Central Bank and they must comply with the relevant codes of conduct as they withdraw from business. This should mean that customers have sufficient notice to make alternative arrangements. The Central Bank's code of conduct on the switching of current accounts with credit institutions will apply when customers are moving current accounts. The recent RBS review by the UK Government confirms the continuing role that Ulster Bank will have in the lending and deposit taking business for all customers here in Ireland. KBC has been expanding its network and its ambitions in Ireland. It is fair to say that it is not all bad news and that the Irish financial market does offer opportunities to institutions. This Government has also taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges, has been disapplied for three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.Confidence in the Irish banks has been restored with reliance on eurosystem funding now a fraction of what it was at the beginning of the programme. Emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, has been removed from the system following the liquidation of IBRC. As part of the 2011 financial measures programme Irish banks were recapitalised to meet a capital requirement identified at €24 billion which was sourced from the private market, burden sharing with subordinated bondholders and from the State. The banking system has been restructured, including the merger of Allied Irish Banks with EBS and the deleveraging planned under the financial measures programme which is due to be completed at the end of this year. The replacement of the promissory notes in IBRC with long-term Government bonds has brought significant cash flow benefits from a sovereign perspective. NAMA has maintained a strong financial position, generating considerable cash, leaving it on track to redeem €7.5 billion of bonds by the end of this year. Private capital has been introduced to the banking system, including the sale of equity in 2011 and contingent capital notes in 2013 in Bank of Ireland and the sale of Irish Life in 2013. This Government will press ahead with further restructuring of the banking sector. In the context of the asset quality review, a preliminary assessment of the balance sheets of the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, banks, a rigorous review is being performed incorporating an assessment of impairment provisions and a review of the appropriateness of risk weights for regulatory capital purposes. The review has the benefit of extensive sampling of loan files. In conducting the review we have had a high level of engagement with staff of the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF on progress, methodology, inputs, outputs and findings. We will agree restructuring plans for AIB and Permanent TSB with the European Commission and these plans will be implemented along with the already agreed restructuring plan for Bank of Ireland. The legacy banking assets now housed in NAMA will be run down over time together with assets that will be transferred to it from the liquidated IBRC. We will continue our policy of exiting our banking investments in a manner that maximises the proceeds to be returned to taxpayers. It remains a key objective of the State to return the banks to profitability as quickly as possible such that they are in a strong position to support and add value to the economy and facilitate an exit for the taxpayer. The State does not wish to be an investor in the banking sector and will seek to exit its various investments over time in a manner that delivers value for the taxpayer. We have already started this process and the financial progress made by the banks this year is encouraging and has been recognised by international investors. As well as stabilising the banks following the crisis we have embarked on an ambitious and far-reaching overhaul of the regulation of the banking and financial services industries. Improved regulation is key to condemning the previous failings to the past and to ensuring that we can sever the toxic link between sovereigns and banks. We have done this both at home and in partnership with our EU neighbours. This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified in reports from Professor Patrick Honohan, Messrs Regling and Watson, the Nyberg Commission and the Moriarty tribunal which pointed out the problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation. One of the challenges facing those who would consider investing in SMEs is the lack of information in the SMEs when compared to larger companies or indeed listed companies. The centralised credit register being established under the Credit Reporting Bill, currently on Report Stage in the Dáil, will aid decisions on the provision of credit to the SME sector and will modernise the framework for collecting and sharing this information in line with best international standards. In 2011 the new fitness and probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 was passed this year which enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.

The issues raised in this motion are ones I have been hearing from local businesses in my constituency in Meath over the past four years of the crisis. As a small business owner I understand the challenges facing SMEs. I also know how stressful an economic downturn can be for the owner or manager of a firm, with sleepless nights and stress-filled days spent trying to figure out how to keep on staff or grow the business. That is why this Government has focused on trying to fix the broken banking system we were left with by the previous Government which through its policies, or lack of policies, through its regulation, or lack of regulation, allowed the Irish banking sector to collapse, at a huge cost to the ordinary hard-pressed family. The Minister must find it very galling to hear the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were responsible for the collapse come in here and call for "action to be taken to ensure the long-term stability of the banking sector". Their heads are all neck and no memory. If they were paying attention to what we have done over the past few years they would see that this is exactly what we have done nationally, through the setting up of the pillar banks, and internationally, through prioritising the banking union at a European level during our recent Presidency of the EU. Our efforts are having some impact. There are signs that the economy is starting to turn around but it takes time for this growth to filter down to our local economies. People sometimes need to see signs of growth before they become confident and start to spend again. There is growth. We have seen 3,000 jobs created in each of the past few months. The live register has gone below 400,000 people for the first time in four years. Exports are continuing to grow and our GDP has been forecast to grow by 1.7% next year. We expect to leave the bailout programme by the middle of December. Of course we need to keep close to what our businesses think. We do not have all the answers. That is why I decided during the summer to undertake a business sentiment survey in Meath. I wanted to understand more about the business climate in Meath right now and what businesses were thinking about the next few years. More than 100 businesses in County Meath responded to my survey and I am very grateful to them for taking the time to do it. The survey showed that overall Meath businesses are optimistic about the future. There were some positive results from the survey including that 80% of businesses expect to maintain staff levels and 60% expect an increase in sales. There were, however, some worrying themes as well from which we need to learn. Over 75% of businesses made it clear that they did not think investing was a good idea in the current economic climate. More than half said experience with the banks was poor. Just 10% use a website for sales and many still have concerns about the stability of the economy and feel that it is too hard to get funding for investment at the moment. Some of our Government schemes need to improve, for example, only 10% of Meath firms are successful when they apply to the micro-finance loan scheme, compared with a 70% success rate in Mayo. We need to ask why this is the case and to make sure that these schemes work for the businesses that need them. We need to improve confidence and get the message out that we are on the way to recovery and growth. We also need to keep on top of the banks and make sure that they are investing in new business to the level they claim to be. We need to encourage more businesses to trade on-line to sell in continental Europe and beyond because there are potential markets there. Among the messages that businesses in Meath want the Government to hear are that the Government must reduce the red tape that exists, that our domestic economy still needs to be simulated and that banks still need to do better in terms of lending performance. I imagine these messages hold true for the rest of the country as much as for Meath. I have passed on this report to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order that when his Department is preparing the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 it can, hopefully, take on board some of these measures. We are seeing improvements but we need to do more especially in respect of the banks and how they are lending to businesses.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	I thank the Minister for his time and I recognise and value his interest in this crucial area. There is no doubt that the contraction of our banking sector will cause inconvenience but we must remember that the fall-out of 250,000 people losing their jobs in the private sector from 2008 to 2011 has reduced demand. As someone who has been involved in business I do not mind travelling a little further for my business banking if the bank I am involved with is actually banking. Most of the small and medium-sized enterprises that have survived so far have achieved a good deal. It has not been easy. The banks have not been lending in recent years and to survive, all costs have had to be examined, frills eliminated and the quality of service and product has had to be maintained. We have travelled so far in this journey but I believe the real challenge lies ahead for SMEs. The challenge is equity. Not many people have mentioned it in the House tonight and it disappoints me when the Opposition does not mention it because it displays a lack of understanding of SMEs, even if the sentiments are well-placed and well-meaning. Why is equity so important? It is because most established SMEs do not have enough equity or have negative equity. The reason established SMEs are in this position is due to their previous strong financial positions as a result of which they diversified in several ways. Some took a play in the property market. Typically, this had a 50% write-down. If SMEs were unlucky enough to be enticed or targeted by some larger banks to invest in foreign property schemes, the write-down could be 100%. Others expanded optimistically and over-invested in equipment and buildings and now have a large capital expense with lower turnover and margin. Today, in this world of reality, SMEs will survive but survival is not good enough. Entrepreneurs like me did not establish businesses simply to survive. We want to expand and grow. However, we will not grow without equity. Simply put, the issue of core and non-core debt needs to be tackled quickly. Onlookers and those not involved in business can be of the opinion that all that is important is cashflow. I smile when armchair experts look at me knowingly and say that it is all about cashflow. Survival is all about cashflow but expansion is about equity. Let us face it: in business a person does not consider expansion if his cashflow is poor, but without equity the consideration of expansion will not become a reality. Strong earnings will enable SMEs to afford taking on new investment projects and successfully repay the greater borrowings. However, if SMEs fail due to equity concerns, one of the ways to expand is to attack new projects on a piecemeal basis, although this will delay the time in reaching the new target. This may seem a reasonable approach but business waits for no one. First, indigenous jobs are not created immediately and second, if the market exists it will be supplied and that may come from expanded imports. Requirements not being filled between suppliers and customers puts doubt in the relationship between both parties and that is not good. There have never been more opportunities for expansion and the Government has offered real and sustainable programmes. The JobBridge programme and the JobsPlus programme have been outstanding examples. JobsPlus offers employers €7,500 towards employing new staff members. It is an important scheme and I welcome it wholeheartedly. This is a great time for SMEs to expand and to put together a loyal and committed workforce. Gone is the casual approach of many employees towards employment and customer service which plagued our economy during the Celtic tiger years. I commend the Minister on his engagement with the European Investment Bank to channel more streams of funding towards SMEs. What are the solutions? I suggest an evaluation should be carried out by the pillar banks to assess core and non-core debt. Only by knowing the extent of the problem can it be rectified. Some SMEs have never failed to make a loan repayment on an interest and principal basis but they have been designated as part of the pillar banks' bad bank. Some SMEs which have never been restructured on a loan due to financial distress also find themselves in the bad bank. Some SMEs have made substantial profits throughout the difficult years but are also part of the bad bank. Once an in-depth analysis is conducted, solutions to these ridiculous situations can be put in place. These will possibly include the direct recapitalisation of non-core business but it is an unlikely option. However, blanket recapitalisation of banks is a blunt instrument. The non-core SME debt should be re-financed over a longer term or else they should avail of lower interest rates. SMEs would also benefit if the non-core debt was State or European-guaranteed. This is similar to the partial loan guarantee fund for smaller loans. It would cost little since most of these SMEs are already feasible. Many SMEs would agree to a reasonable levy to partake in the scheme which would free the equity associated with non-core assets and open up the way for new business loans and job creation. Let us remember that getting a loan now takes time and proper analysis. There is little chance of repeating the poor lending practices which took place in this country and led to many of the problems we have. We need to protect our SMEs and allow them to borrow once more by solving the non-core debt issue. If this does not happen, then for the next ten to 15 years these successful companies will be excluded from progressive expansion. As I stated earlier, standing still is not an option. Anyone who sets up a business or anyone involved in business wants to expand and that is the final letter on it. A ten-year sin bin may will condemn many SMEs to a slow wind-down. Many of the owner-directors in existing SMEs will be looking at retirement rather than expansion in ten to 15 years time and it is important to recognise this. This is a work in progress and I recognise the work done to date by the Minister and the Government. The progressive approach taken towards business with the Action Plan for Jobs, the jobs initiative and Pathways to Work represents the first time SMEs have been engaged with and taken seriously. The National Pensions Reserve Fund and the National Treasury Management Agency funding offer great potential and I am delighted to hear it. It delivers something more important: hope to all of us who have clung on in recent years, who have kept people employed and who have fought against the odds. I have no doubt we will succeed and I thank the Minister.

Sílim go bhfuil an cheist fíorthábhachtach seo á plé againn ag an am ceart. Ní hamháin gur chóir go mbeadh gnóthaí beaga in ann chreidmheas eacnamaíochta a fháil, mar atá luaite go mór sa díospóireacht go dtí seo, ach ba cheart freisin cabhair a thabhairt don ghnáthdhuine amuigh ansin atá ag cuardach creidmheasa le cibé rud a dhéanamh - gluaisteán úr a cheannach, páiste a chur ar scoil nó dul ar aghaidh sa saol. Tá sé soiléir le cúpla bliain anuas go bhfuil daingniú nó cúngú tagtha ar an méid creidmheasa atá ar fáil do ghnóthaí beaga. Cluinim é sin i mo Dháilcheantar go minic, agus silím gurb amhlaidh an cás do Theachtaí i gceantrair eile. Tuigim go bhfuil na gearáin céanna ag teacht isteach go dtí a gcuid oifigí is atá ag teacht isteach go dtí mo oifig. Níl gnóthaí beaga nó gnáthdhaoine ábalta creidmheas a fháil ó na bainc nó na comhair creidmheasa. Baineann cuid den fáth leis na srianta atá curtha orthu ag Banc Ceannais na hÉireann. Tá na srianta atá curtha ar na comhair creidmheasa, mar shampla, ag cur isteach ar ghnáthdhaoine amuigh ansin. That being said, the tabling of the motion by the Fianna Fáil party is right. This is the proper time to have the debate on access to credit. Not only SMEs but many ordinary people seek access to credit in the run-up to Christmas and we are not too far away from that. How to pay for ordinary bills or presents is something on the minds of many people. This is a time when many people access the local credit union or financial institution. Unfortunately, some will go to moneylenders, legal and illegal, to access credit at this time of the year.However, no constituency in the State has not been inundated with case studies of small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that are struggling to find credit from banks or financial institutions with which they had long-standing relationships. While such enterprises were being drooled over by the financial institutions a few years ago with regard to the provision of credit, this has all dried up. Moreover, there has been a massaging of the figures that have been presented publicly heretofore. However, as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has dealt with the issue of how overdrafts are being turned into long-term loans and presented as new lending, I will not labour that point. This issue must be put into the context of the recent past. A notable economist came to these shores in recent days and spoke of a lost decade but one need only go back half of that decade, that is, to 2008 when the banking crisis started. The efforts that have taken place heretofore have not resolved the problems in the banking system and five years later, it is not possible to call it a normal banking system. As for the €64 billion of taxpayers' money, Members are familiar with all the pain and hardship that ordinary people throughout the State have been obliged to endure as a result of the decision that was taken by the previous Government, which unfortunately has been supported by the current Administration with regard to the injections it has made to recapitalise the banks. That money has not resulted in a new dawn for the existing financial institutions, which have not yet returned to normal practices. The targets that have been set by the Government for lending to new businesses have not materialised or have not been reached. As for the targets for dealing with mortgages, the different initiatives, going right back to the Keane report and other reports, have not borne fruit and the mortgage crisis has got out of control. It is to be hoped this has started to wane and the tide has begun to turn on that matter. However, the withdrawal of two banks from this State this week demonstrates the crisis is far from over and still persists. While it might not be as talked about and deposits might not be fleeing from the banks, the banking system in this State remains broken. The State will not have a proper banking system for as long as the current level of mortgage arrears continues. I will not just focus on mortgage arrears but refer to the problem with this State. Deputy Michael McGrath gave the analogy of credit being the fuel that drives the economy and that is 100% correct. It is the oil that lubricates the engine but one must be careful as to the type of oil one puts into one's engine because were one to put in the wrong type, one could do serious damage to it. From the point of view of the State, credit is needed, as is a banking system that is properly able to maintain the supply of credit in the economy. However, it must be sensible credit and it must be sensible lending. One reason that banks are not lending at present is because there is far too much debt in the Irish economy, be that business debt, personal debt or banking debt. This is where one must get to the crux of the matter and it takes me back to the point on mortgage arrears, which is that for as long as one in four domestic mortgages are in arrears, the State will not have a normal banking system. Until the banks begin to get through this message that they must begin to take action, one definitely will see the aforementioned lost decade for the economy. My party has proposed amendments to the motion to provide a more rounded debate today, but absent from it is the context of what has happened to the €64 billion that has been injected and committed by the Government. Unfortunately, even though some rescheduling has taken place, every penny of that recapitalisation is to be paid by Irish taxpayers. In the context of credit, the motion does not simply speak to the SME sector but rightly refers to moneylenders. However, it does not mention the issue of large credit providers in the State, namely, the credit union sector and it is important to note the significance of that sector in society, which I consider to be of systemic importance today. I believe there is a need for an independent examination of how the Newbridge Credit Union issue was handled by the Government, the Central Bank and the special manager, as I believe they made a dog's dinner out of it, to say the least. It took 22 months to reach a point at which the credit union was to be liquidated within days because of a run on the credit union. This run on the credit union is being explained away as a result of a report that was carried in The Sunday Business Post. This issue has not been managed properly and lessons must be learned in this regard. I welcome the Minister's statement earlier today to the effect that this issue was unique and he is not contemplating that this will affect one in four credit unions across the State. Indeed it is unlikely that other credit unions will be dipping into State funds in respect of restructuring in the future, where necessary. However, I have been alarmed by the contents of the affidavit under the heading stating liquidation is not in the public interest. The affidavit explains the reason for this and refers to Newbridge Credit Union not being systemically important. Indeed, it goes on to state that the overall size of the credit union sector is not of a size to generate serious systemic issues in Ireland under normal circumstances. Consequently, the credit union is not systemically important and it then only becomes an issue because the Central Bank starts to tease out that the credit unions have €7.1 billion in deposits in the banks and were an issue to arise with Newbridge Credit Union, it could fall onto other credit unions and then those credit unions would withdraw their money from the banks. My problem with this is it appears to be not about the credit union sector itself or its democratic importance and the role it plays in Ireland, but actually about the impact it will have on the banks. In fact, it is about saving the banks at all times. As for moneylenders, I welcome the reference in the motion, as Members are aware that people are being driven into the hands of moneylenders. They will have noted that 25% of customers have experienced difficulties in making repayments in the past 18 months with 63% of those reporting that repayment difficulties were caused by a drop in household income. While many people are accessing credit from moneylenders or credit unions simply to try to get by and pay bills, I note I have brought forward legislation on this issue previously. In 2012, some 46 moneylenders were licensed in this State, of which 29 charged an annual percentage rate, APR, of more than 100%, 14 charged APRs of more than 150% and one moneylender charged an interest rate of 210%. In conclusion, I refer to the hope mentioned by the previous speaker. I believe this country needs a good dose of hope because sometimes, the only thing that keeps people going is the hope they will see the light at the end of the tunnel. Many small to medium-sized enterprises and individuals have been clinging onto that hope and hopefully it will be realised in a real fashion and these people and enterprises will see the light sooner rather than later and will see clarity and real tangible support at the end of a long dark road. However, as for welcoming the Minister's statements on the State bank or the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to borrow a phrase, one cannot rely on statements. Three years on, that money is still lying in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. A bank has been liquidated, other banks have been merged and banks have withdrawn from the State but yet, three years later, more than €6 billion is lying in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Members still only have promises in manifestoes and statements from the Minister. It is past time to act.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	Since my election, there has been much talk about those high-technology jobs for which multinationals are crying out. One should remember the economy and jobs across this island are predominantly to be found in the SME sector. I understand that 99% of all companies registered and approximately 78% of all employment can be found within the SME sector. In essence, this is a nation of small businesses and sole traders. If one looks back at the economic collapse in 2007 and 2008, the policy and political decisions by the previous Government and its successor have prolonged that recession and have undermined the environment in which the SME sector must recover. That sector faced what one might call the perfect storm, in that there was a lack of credit, a recession and a stagnating domestic economy. If one looks back over the past five or six years, it is clear there was some collateral fallout as a result of the policies that were implemented. Nothing was done to harness those sections of enterprise that were productive, such as the entrepreneurs and the manufacturing sector and as a result, the number of business closures increased, as did the rate of unemployment.We would agree that credit is the lifeblood of the small and medium enterprise sector, SME. It provides working capital, finances to get over lean periods in businesses and a stimulus to enable the SME sector to grow. The drying up of credit due to the banking collapse a number of years ago placed an immediate pressure on the SME sector. Scores of viable businesses went to the wall as a result of the economic collapse. No capital was available, there was no lending and no credit was being made available for small businesses and sole traders to help navigate their way through the economic collapse. In the lead-up to the banking collapse and consequent economic collapse many small businesses were advised to diversify into new areas and expand their businesses. When the collapse occurred, many of those companies were faced with huge property debts and, as a result, some of them went to the wall. The over-reliance by the previous Government and this Government on export-driven recovery ignores the reality that the majority of SMEs rely on the domestic economy to survive and flourish. The continuing policy of austerity in terms of not stimulating the domestic economy is one of the reasons the sector is still in trouble and needs a helping hand. It is poisoning the very environment the SME sector needs to help drive economic recovery. The Government is in denial having regard to some of the announcements it has made. I am sure the Minister can point to some of the targets he has set out and say we are meeting them, but much of the funding that has been made available is roll-over funding. The Credit Review Office found that in 55% of the cases where credit was refused, it was wrongly refused. It is clear that the banks are still refusing to give credit. We had the establishment of Microfinance Ireland and it was claimed that it would deliver a loans programme of approximately €90 million in addition to creating 7,700 jobs over the next ten years. In the first year alone its set-up and running costs have been in excess of €1.1 million and it has only delivered €1.6 million in loans to 107 enterprises throughout the State. If one considers those enterprises that have been lent money, there are great geographical differences in terms of where the money is being spent. Donegal has not received any funds despite a number of companies there having applied for funding. The Government needs to focus on the geographic spread in this respect. It was promised that the loan guarantee scheme would provide lending of up to €150 million per year. To date, the lending figure has been in the region of €6 million, most of which has been for working capital therefore has not been invested in growth. Much assistance and many policy and political decisions need to be made in the short term to help our economic recovery in terms of the SME sector.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	401	I compliment Fianna Fáil on tabling an excellent Private Members' motion. As I do not have as much time to speak on it as I would like, I will concentrate on the SME sector in terms of sustaining economic recovery and supporting job creation. Almost 1,600 SMEs went to the wall over a period of two and half years, and it is estimated that another 800 to 900 are struggling. Coincidentally, before I knew this motion would come before the Dáil, last week I met a number of people representing small to medium enterprises in Waterford and they told me of the difficulty they have in getting footfall into businesses and in accessing finance to sustain or grow their businesses. All SMEs would say that high rent, high rates and having to pay wages are the big worries they have, but they would add to those the word "austerity". A firm in Waterford, Kellys, which had been in business since the Famine, has closed. It was able to beat the Famine but it could not beat this recession. The manager of that firm said it comes down to footfall. People are not coming in because they simply do not have the money. He believes the final nail in the coffin was the property tax which has meant people have had to cut back more. Deputy Doherty spoke about how the banks drooled over many of these firms in the good times and fired money out to them, but now they are being drilled into, as it were. I have spoken to people in small businesses and they have told me it is almost impossible for them to get funding from the banks. The banks send them questionnaires and proposals as to how the businesses can save money. Some of the proposals recommending that jobs be cut are outrageous. I know of one small firm in which the husband and wife are the only ones left working, and they work 70 to 80 hours a week. They are at the end of their tether. They have had to let go the one person they employed. They have to do the accounts and all other aspects of the business. They have told me that they might make it to Christmas but they do not know if they will. They do not have money. They went to their bank and asked if it could help them through but were told it could not because it does not see their business as being viable because there are only two of them, they are struggling, they have had to let people go and it does not know if their business will survive. They are in a catch-22 situation or a vicious circle where they need a few bob to get them through and the bank does not see them as being viable. It is not their fault they are in this position. People do not support their business because they do not have the money to do so. There is also a knock-on effect with the quality of working conditions. There is less money, fewer hours and less spending because austerity affects the people's quality of life. Many small businesses are restricted to paying the minimum wage. They will say that is all they can pay. Therefore, their workers are unhappy and barely struggling. Some of them use the minimum hours contracts where one is signed up for perhaps four hours and one is almost a slave to the company, which is no fault of the company because it is struggling. Those people cannot sign on social welfare and they have very little wages over the week. They in turn cannot spend money in SMEs and that is the vicious circle that continues. I accept it would be difficult for the Minister to do this but it would be worthwhile if he were to pop into small businesses and ask them what the problem is and they will respond by saying it is rent, rates, wages and austerity. I am not making an ideological argument that it all comes down to austerity. People will tell the Minister that because there is less spending in the economy, there is less spending in businesses and that has a knock-on effect. I refer again to the 1,600 businesses that have gone to the wall and the many more that are struggling. They are seeking new measures, incentives and ideas that can help them through, but one cannot beat an input of financial backing. I refer again to that small company that might go to the wall after Christmas which probably could survive if it had a little bit of help from the bank that tells them it is not doing well. If that is the response banks give to SMEs because very many of them are not doing well, they have no hope of getting finance. Where will that leave us?
