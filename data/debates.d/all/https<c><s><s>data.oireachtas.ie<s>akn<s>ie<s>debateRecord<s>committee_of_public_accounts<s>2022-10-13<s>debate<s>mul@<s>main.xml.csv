#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	0	I welcome everyone to this morning's meeting. We have received apologies from Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Verona Murphy. If attending in the committee room, members are asked to exercise personal responsibility and protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied this morning by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to examine both the 2021 Appropriation Account for Vote 29 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services, Chapter 9: Implementation of the National Broadband Plan. We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General and Accounting Officer; Mr. Philip Nugent, assistant secretary of environment protection, circular economy and governance; Mr. Fergal Mulligan, assistant secretary of communications; and principal officers, Mr. Robert Deegan and Ms Louise Carrigan. We are also joined in the committee room by Mr. Ken Cleary, principal officer in the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. You are all very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure that your mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	1	The appropriation account for Vote 29, Environment, Climate and Communications, records total expenditure of €664 million in 2021. This was 55% more than the €428 million spent in 2020, but fell almost €105 million short of the total expenditure provided for in the Vote for 2021. Receipts into the Vote during the year amounted to €12.3 million, slightly ahead of what was budgeted for and the result was a net surplus at the year end of just over €106 million. The standard requirement is for any voted funds remaining unspent at the year end to be surrendered to the Exchequer. However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may allow up to 10% of unspent capital funding in a Vote to be carried over for use in the following year. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was allowed to carry over the maximum amount from 2021, around €58 million, and the balance of €48 million was duly surrendered.  Expenditure in 2021 on the communications programme amounted to €164 million. This was €85 million less than budgeted for, mainly because of lower-than-expected spending on implementation of the National Broadband Plan, NBP. Anticipating the spending shortfall, €52.5 million was moved from this programme to two others, using the Supplementary Estimate process. The largest block of spending under the Vote was on the energy programme, with €327 million charged for 2021. The bulk of this, €291 million, was charged to the B.4 sustainable energy programme subhead. However, the charges included the transfer of €160 million to the Department’s energy efficiency national fund in December 2021. As note 7.2 to the account explains, this transfer remained unspent at the year end. The result was that actual expenditure under the sustainable energy programme in 2021 was, in fact, only around 3% up on the 2020 level.  The Department spent just under €128 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2021. Of this, €49 million went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The continuing costs associated with landfill remediation are also funded under this programme and amounted to €21 million in the year.Members may wish to note that the Department is responsible for oversight of a broad range of public sector bodies, including the communications and utilities regulators and major commercial State bodies such as the ESB, EirGrid and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA. The bodies are listed in an appendix to the appropriation account. Turning to the report, the objective of the national broadband plan, NBP, as members will be aware, is to ensure that access to a high-speed broadband service is available to all residences and businesses in the State. Roll-out of the service is focused on those parts of the territory of the State where commercial providers of broadband do not provide a service or do not have plans to invest, collectively referred to as the intervention area. National Broadband Ireland, often referred to as NBI, was contracted by the Department in late 2019 to deliver on the broadband plan objectives. Contractual arrangements between public and private entities to provide infrastructure and operate services typically focus on the identification of project and operating risks and on who bears responsibility for them. The agreed risk allocation is reflected in the financial costs or rewards factored into the contract. In the case of the broadband plan, the overall Government subsidy is capped at €2.7 billion, with most of this payable over the initial infrastructure build phase. This is currently expected to conclude by January 2028. At the time the examination was being completed, the infrastructure build plan was running about 12 months behind schedule. The target for the number of premises to be passed by end January 2022 was originally 115,000. As permitted under the contract terms, NBI proposed in March 2021 that this target be reduced to 60,000 premises passed. The actual number of premises passed at end January 2022 was 34,456, just 30% of the original target and 58% of the revised target. However, it is good to note that the take-up rate for the broadband service by the occupiers of the premises passed is higher than originally projected. The delays in the plan roll-out have resulted in total subsidy payments to end 2021 amounting to just over €177 million. This represented less than half of the subsidy payment originally provided for in the Vote for 2020 and 2021. In addition, under the contract terms, certain financial sanctions apply to underachievement of the revised delivery targets. The Department has accepted that approximately two thirds of the delay to date was due to the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions but has imposed sanctions for delays it considers relate to issues within NBI’s control. By end August 2022, build delay sanctions totalling almost €135,000 had been imposed. Separately, a performance sanction of €22,500 has been applied based on performance reports up to end April 2021. As the examination report was being finalised, the Department was carrying out a review of performance reports more recently received from NBI, and further financial sanctions may arise from these. The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on the current status of this work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	3	The total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2021 amounted to €664 million, 14% or €105 million below the budgetary allocation of €769 million, which included capital carryover. The extensive Covid-19-related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April 2021 had a significant impact on activity on the NBP, the sustainable energy programmes and the landfill remediation programme, and this is the main driver of the underspend last year. On the national broadband plan, I outlined to the committee when I was last before it in February, and in subsequent correspondence, the unprecedented challenges faced in delivering the plan arising primarily from the Covid-19 pandemic. We are, however, seeing significant evidence this year that the network build has gained momentum and that this will continue into 2023 and subsequent years. As of 1 October this year, more than 337,000 premises are design complete and 210,000 premises are under construction, with 108,000 through the make-ready programme. A total of 94,500 premises can order or preorder a connection, while more than 85,000 premises are passed and available for immediate connection. In excess of 20,500 premises, or 24% of the premises passed, are connected, which is exceeding expectations for this stage of the project. Connections are running at approximately 2,000 per month. By the end of next January, the revised target of 102,000 premises to be passed will be achieved. In fact, we are advised this target of 102,000 premises will be achieved by end December, with a further 80,000 to 85,000 premises to be passed in 2023. There are now more than 300 staff employed directly by NBI, along with 1,100 indirect employees working with build and design contractors. A total of 271 public broadband connection points are live on the NBP network. Some 470 national schools within the intervention area have been provided with a high-speed broadband connection under the plan and are either live or are ready to go live. In 2022, roll-out to the islands commenced, with premises on four islands off County Donegal currently able to order or preorder high-speed broadband. NBI is progressing fibre design and build actives on a further six islands off counties Galway, Mayo and Cork while progressing service and designs for additional islands off counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Cork. In 2021, the Department provided €327 million under its energy programme, up 60% on 2020. The figure €101.3 million was spent on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, retrofitting schemes, with 15,500 home upgrades completed. This included nearly 4,100 solar photovoltaic, PV, installations, 4,600 homes upgraded to a B2 standard, 2,000 heat pump installations and almost 2,300 free upgrades to energy-poor households under the warmer homes and warmth and well-being scheme. In addition, approval was obtained to transfer €160 million from the Vote to the energy efficiency national fund to fund the establishment of a new residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme, as well as to support additional energy upgrades under the warmer homes scheme and other SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes. Other key achievements in the energy area in 2021 include the continued roll-out of the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with the first onshore RESS projects energised in quarter 4 of last year. Approximately 530 MW of renewable energy is expected to have been energised by year end 2022 under the RESS, with a further 300 MW in 2023. RESS 1 is expected to deliver an approximate 15% increase in Ireland's current renewable energy generation capacity by the end of 2023. Auctions were completed for onshore RESS 2 in June 2022, which is expected to deliver a further 20% increase in renewable energy capacity and the design of a RESS 3 is under development, as is the design of the first offshore renewable energy scheme. Spending under the environment and waste management programme was €128 million, slightly ahead of its original allocation. More than €20 million of the €128 million was spent by 21 local authorities to support landfill risk assessment and remediation work on more than 70 sites around the country, most of them old municipal landfills that operated prior to regulation and require engineering measures to ensure the protection of the environment, air and water quality for local communities. In excess of €13 million was spent on other waste management initiatives. The majority of the spend was on enforcement-related activities. Funding was also provided for once-off litter initiatives in 2021 to support an outdoor summer and prevent littering in public areas. By the end of 2021, 52 just transition fund projects had entered into grant agreements and were commencing the roll-out of their projects. The total value of projects in the delivery phase is €28 million, with €19 million in grant funding. These projects will bring €12 million in additional funding to the midlands and support approximately 150 direct jobs in the grantee organisations and approximately 890 indirect jobs, as self-reported by the project. The year 2021 was significant for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC. Following completion of a capacity review early in the year, the Government accepted the capacity review's recommendations and agreed a number of actions, including the sanction of an additional 20 staff to be appointed by the end of 2022. In addition, in May 2021, the HSE was subjected to a serious criminal cyberattack through the infiltration of IT systems using Conti ransomware. The NCSC provided support to the HSE in identifying the systems affected by the cyberattack and to bring all systems back online. The Comptroller and Auditor General covered this comprehensively in the appropriation accounts this year.The Department is tasked with delivering significant policy programmes to achieve a climate neutral, sustainable and digitally connected Ireland. The Appropriation Account 2021 sets out where the Department has invested its resources in 2021 to progress the achievement of this outcome in the context of significant challenges. I look forward to assisting committee members with their questions today.

Deputy Devlin is first, with 15 minutes. He will be followed by Deputy Dillon.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	5	I welcome all of our witnesses. I will start with cybersecurity and the NCSC. Mr. Griffin said that the ambition was that 20 new staff would be recruited by the end of this year. Given that we are close to that point now, how successful has that been? What is the status of the recruitment programme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	6	It has gone pretty well. When the Government approved the capacity review in the middle of last year, we had 25 staff in the NCSC and the ambition was to recruit 20 this year to bring the total to 45 and to have 70 staff recruited within a five-year period. At this stage we have moved from 25 to 37. There was quite a lot of interest, from both the public and private sectors, in the jobs that were advertised and the process is under way to recruit the additional staff. We are satisfied that the target of 45 will be achieved by the end of the year. We have also made provision in the Vote in 2023 that will allow us to bring forward some of the recruitment that we had intended for years four and five of the recruitment programme. When the Government made its decision in mid-2021, it would have been mid-2026 when we expected to hit the target of 70 staff but we now expect to achieve that by the end of 2024. It is encouraging to see the quality and calibre of people who are applying for these jobs, both from the public and private sectors. It has been quite reassuring for us.

Renovations were carried out on the interim facility being used for the centre. What was the extent of those renovations, what did they cost and why were they done on an interim facility when there was a plan to move to a new facility?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	8	A key component of the work of the NCSC is dealing with other international cybersecurity organisations, as well as dealing with confidential information provided by An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and, therefore, there is a need to have a secure facility in place in whatever accommodation the NCSC operates from. We will have a permanent headquarters soon. We are moving out of our building on Adelaide Road at the end of 2023 because the lease is up. We are repurposing the Department's offices in Beggars Bush, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, offices, as the headquarters of the Department and that is where the NCSC will ultimately reside. That building will be fully fitted out to make sure it complies with the international standards required. We had to make sure in the interim period that the premises that the NCSC operates from will comply with those international standards and that is why the fit-out had to be such. It had to comply with the relevant international standards. Those standards are set out in regulations so a significant investment had to be made in the temporary facility. As I understand it, parts of that can be lifted and shifted to the final premises in Beggar's Bush. I also gather from conversations the NCSC has had with the Office of Public Works, OPW, that other State agencies would be interested in using the interim facility as a secure facility once the NCSC moves out. I am satisfied-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	10	The premises is in the ownership of the OPW and is being fitted out by the OPW. As I understand it, other State entities are interested in using that as a secure facility, so from a value-for-money perspective we are reasonably well protected in that regard.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	11	Does Mr. Griffin have an idea of the costs to date? How much has been spent on those interim works?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	12	So far we have spent approximately €75,000, excluding VAT. We estimate that the cost to our Department will be €215,000 but there is also the cost to the OPW, which I do not have. I am happy to follow up with the committee secretariat afterwards on the OPW costs.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	13	Is the newer building in Beggars Bush that the NCSC will move in to also owned by the OPW or is that leased?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	14	It is State-owned.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	15	Okay, that is fine. If Mr. Griffin could provide a note on that, it would be much appreciated. I will now turn to the NBP, which we have discussed previously at the committee. I understand the deployment plan is 12 months behind schedule. Delving into that further, fines of €135,000 were issued in respect of build delays. I gather from what Mr. Griffin said in his opening statement, some of that is related to Covid-19 and other issues. A performance sanction of €22,500 was also issued. Performance reports for subsequent periods indicate that further sanctions may arise. Have the sanctions that were levied been paid? How many others have arisen since this report?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	16	The Deputy has raised a number of issues there and I will ask Mr. Mulligan to respond to some of them. I will start with the good news, as it were. When we spoke in February the position as outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his opening remarks and as set out in the chapter was not where we wanted to be, in terms of the number of premises passed and connected. The committee would have heard that from NBI as well and about the mitigations that were put in place. We are seeing a significant shift in activity in terms of designs completed, the number of premises that are make-ready commenced and the numbers that are coming through the make-ready programme. We have 158,000 that are through the make-ready programme and have gone into the NBI hopper to complete the premises-passed programme and be made available for connection for householders. A good pipeline of activity is happening and there is a lot more confidence on our part in terms of the line of sight we have on the direction of travel of the project-----
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	17	Are they not revised targets?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	18	Those targets would have been provided to us. They would have been discussed between the Department's NBP team and NBI in terms of the updated interim remedial plan.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	19	Are we not behind on the revised targets?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	20	We are not behind on the revised targets, no, but if one looks at where we had intended to be at the outset of this programme, with a fair wind, pre-Covid we would have expected that by the end of contract year three we would have 204,000 premises passed. We will have 102,000 premises passed so we are roughly a year behind. We have allowed eight and a half months of that to NBI as part of the review process and there are three and half months that will be part of a sanction process. I will ask Mr. Mulligan to set out the work that has been done on that and how that adjudication was arrived at in terms of what is leviable and the level of due diligence that goes in between the NBP senior manager's team and NBI in settling on an appropriate figure.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	21	Just before Mr. Mulligan comes in I would like to ask another question because my time is limited. From 1 February to August of this year, sanctions totalling €134,800 were imposed but I understand there is a refundable option if other build milestones are achieved.I ask Mr. Mulligan to touch on this in his response.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	22	The simple way to put this is that, based on analysis we carried out in 2021 and 2022, NBI approached us to say Covid caused a lot of difficulties. Had Covid not happened, the programme would be approximately 3.5 months behind. We have determined that 8.5 months of the delay was related to Covid, for which the company gets relief because things happened beyond its control that it could do nothing about. In net terms, the programme is approximately 3.5 months behind and this is where the sanctions kick in. They have kicked for milestones over the past six or eight months that were missed. This is happening every week. There are 227 deployment areas in the programme. Each has a sanction per day associated with it. For every day it is late there is a financial sanction. So far there is a total of €150,000, of which €135,000 is related to the build. Next week we will impose more sanctions, as we will in the following weeks as there are delays. We have notified the company of a further €100,000 that will be sanctioned in the coming weeks. Again this will be credited against any subsidy that is paid out.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	23	When does the refundable option kick in? How is it traded off against the milestones that are missed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	24	If a milestone scheduled for June is reached in March, the company would be ahead of schedule. We will hit the company if it is late but we give it an incentive to be early. It will get a credit if it is early. This is how it works. On the operations front, we have a number of reports on our desks that we are still reviewing. Sanctions of approximately €20,000 have been applied. A number of sanctions will be applied in due course. There are approximately seven reports for seven quarters on our desks. They will conclude in the coming weeks. I will not say what the sanctions are but they will be applied. They are not fully imposed yet. Until this is done, we will not say what the number is. This will continue for 25 years. If the company breaches key performance indicators, we will impose sanctions. For example, if the company is supposed to connect premises within a certain timeframe and misses the target, we will impose a sanction. If the network is down in somebody's house for a number of hours beyond what it should be, we will impose a sanction. This will continue for 25 years. While it is approximately €20,000 now, this time next year it will be a different amount if the company breaches key performance indicators. Every quarter we will report on sanctions.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	25	I thank Mr. Mulligan. With regard to blackspots, we focus a lot on rural Ireland but there are obviously blackspots in urban Ireland also. There are some glaring ones where there is fibre in the ground but houses cannot connect to it. I know the Department is aware of certain situations. I brought some to its attention. It is galling for people in an estate of 700 houses where it would seem financially lucrative for them to be able to connect but service providers are not willing to take up the mantle. This is a real problem for us. It goes beyond the national broadband plan because the fibre is there. How do we get around this problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	26	This issue is being brought to our attention regularly. Part of it is because people are aware that, under the national broadband plan, the level of connectivity is well in excess of what was flagged in the plan. The plan was based on a 30 Mb download target. This was the bar in the mapping exercise to determine what areas were covered by commercial operators. The minimum service now is 500 Mb. People sitting in the middle of Dublin city wondering whether they are 30 Mb are quite envious of this. There are two answers to this. The first is a difficult answer that takes quite a lot of time. We have spent a lot of time working with operators flagging issues and working through them. It may be down to their own network and work they have to do. Sometimes it is down to a piece of infrastructure that is needed and the operators might need to engage with local authorities on it. I will give an overview of the broader picture of the three big providers of fixed networks outside the national broadband plan. Eir has said it will build its full fibre network to 1.9 million premises. Virgin Media has said it will reach 1 million premises. SIRO has said it will reach 750,000 premises. Obviously, there is overlap in these but they will deal with many of the problems. The problem is that fibre brings broadband to a cabinet from which people may be a long distance on a copper line. The build out will bring the fibre the whole way to the premises and it will resolve the vast majority of these issues. Last week when the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, spoke on Second Stage of the Communications Regulation Bill, he made a very strong statement on the build of such infrastructure. There is an expectation that, as commercial operators roll out and design the deployments, they do not leave small pockets of premises behind and they do not leave households and businesses stranded. The critical point is users can connect. This is the core point we have seen in some of the instances mentioned by Deputy Devlin. The network is there but users cannot connect. The commercial operators really need to look at the deployments. It is the case in the national broadband plan that people will always be able to connect. This is the messaging we are getting back on the connections to date. The message the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, conveyed to the commercial operators is that they need to design their networks so they do not leave pockets behind and people are able to connect.

The Department needs a carrot and stick approach with certain operators. While they have plans, the public have been waiting years for them to be able to connect to cabinets or whatever other infrastructure is required. In urban areas there is an expectation, and rightly so. Not being able to connect when fibre is right outside the house is illogical.

I will begin with Vote 29 and the appropriation accounts for 2021. I will direct my questioning on Inland Fisheries Ireland to the Secretary General. Expenditure of €28 million was accounted for by IFI to support the protection, conservation and development of Ireland inland fishing resources in 2021. The provisional Estimate for IFI was €34 million. Will Mr. Griffin give the committee an insight into the reason for the €6 million underspend in IFI?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	29	One of the biggest problems an Accounting Officer has at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts is trying to find the right note. This came up in the accounts the Comptroller and Auditor General previously produced. It is an issue he raised regarding the extent of cash holdings by Inland Fisheries Ireland. We withheld €4.5 million from IFI because it already had a significant cash holding in its accounts. We have been trying to run this down in recent years to keep it in line with what we considered normal for a State agency of this nature. What the Vote spend does not show is the spend from own resources. The bulk of the €5.9 million underspend was withholding €4.5 million due to cash in hand. I do not believe it greatly affected the activities of IFI during 2021. Like many other organisations it was affected by Covid. It had a significant programme of activities it delivered during the course of the year.

In the context of the recent issues arising with regard to the resignation earlier this year of two board members of IFI in the aftermath of concerns being flagged during an internal audit, as the chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Griffin's internal audit system and risk committee are very important. I am sure he and his colleagues in the Department are familiar with the issues that arose. What steps has his Department taken to investigate concerns relating to financial or other irregularities in bodies or agencies under his remit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	34	On the IFI issue, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister commissioned a review under section 18 of the Inland Fisheries Act. He appointed Conleth Bradley, senior counsel, to examine the functioning of the board in accordance with that provision. That work is now complete. A copy of the report-----

What procedures does Mr. Griffin have in place to deal with that type of incident in bodies under his remit? Did the Department ensure that an investigation was conducted independently of the staff within IFI? I did not mention the board. Mr. Griffin mentioned the report of Mr. Bradley into the board-----

As I understand it, a number of issues were raised. They were examined by the board. They had been addressed previously in audit reviews and in the statement of internal financial control that was signed off on behalf of the board by the then chair earlier this year. The report of the chair on behalf of the board confirmed that the issues identified were addressed and that issues such as the use of IFI assets were being appropriately managed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	54	I probably want the Deputy to clarify what the instance is because, to make a general point, where issues are brought to the attention of the Department, we would consider whether they are matters for the Department and the Minister to deal with. We did that in the case of the review of the board that was undertaken by Conleth Bradley. Where we are in receipt of other information, we would undertake the exact same process of considering whether these are matters that are appropriate to the Department or that fall directly within the governance and management functions of IFI, and we would make the call at that point. If things need to be investigated further by the Department under whatever pieces of legislation are available to us, we will do that.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	55	Let us look at the issues that have arisen as a result of the board's concern regarding ongoing issues within IFI. I refer to fleet management, for instance. Mr. Griffin might be aware that on 10 August 2021 an IFI vehicle was involved in a car crash in Manorhamilton. The IFI vehicle was rear-ended. Was the Department informed of this issue, which involved an uninsured vehicle?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	56	I am not aware of that. I do not know whether Mr. Nugent wants to comment on the specific or-----

On 26 August, Mr. Griffin wrote to the committee regarding the retrofitting programme, the targets and some of the changes in the funding of those. I ask him to help us untangle the carbon revenue levy account, the energy efficiency national account, the climate action account and the movement of funds between those accounts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	72	The carbon revenue levy account is used for the acquisition of carbon credits where such acquisition is needed to comply with the State’s EU emissions reduction targets for 2020. That is the carbon fund. The climate action fund is a statutory fund that was set up under the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Treasury Services Act 2020. There was a commitment in the programme for Government for €500 million to be committed over a ten-year period to fund projects primarily in the renewable energy and energy-efficiency area. It is funded through the NORA levy. The energy-efficiency national fund, EENF, was set up originally in 2014 by way of regulation. I will get Mr. Deegan to explain this a bit better if needed. We have an energy-efficiency obligation scheme which is in place for certain energy companies that have to provide a level of energy retrofit to meet their obligations under the scheme. If they do not comply with that by the delivery of the works, a compensatory financial amount can be paid and allocated to the fund. As set out by the Comptroller and Attorney General in the appropriation account and in his opening statement, in 2021 we transferred €160 million of an underspend from the Vote to the EENF to be used for two things.

That was to be used for two things: first, to fund retrofit works in 2022, particularly to support those in energy poverty through the warmer homes scheme; and second, €60 million to fund the loan guarantee scheme to provide low-cost loans to local authorities.

Mr. Griffin mentioned the better energy warmer homes schemes, which is incredibly popular. It is so popular that in Mr. Griffin’s correspondence he alluded to the fact that there is a delay of over 27 months in people being able to access that scheme. To get to the bottom of that, has Mr. Griffin given consideration to why those waiting times are there?

We increased the eligibility of the scheme. As a consequence, there has been a significant ramp up of applicants to the scheme, which is a good thing to see. We want to support those who need support from the State to heat their homes.

Why would any of those 80,000 people not apply for a scheme that allows them to have their home almost entirely insulated for free? The Department would have to expect that the decision to increase the fuel allowance will blow its figures out of the water in terms of delivery.

Even if half of those 80,000 additional people make an application in January, that is an additional 40,000 people, which is four times the additional amount that happened at the previous expansion.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	107	We are kind of unique as a Department in that our budgetary provision for retrofit between now and the end of 2030 has been set out in the national development plan. We know we have at least €8 billion to spend. We know precisely what we will have for the next five years. I think we are one of only two Departments have that set out in such precise terms. This could be looked at in a couple of ways. It could be said that it is a bad thing that people now have access to this. However, it is not. These are the people who need access to the greatest extent possible. The challenge for the Department and the SEAI now is how to manage that. Mr. Deegan rightly set out that we did an average of 177 units a month in 2021, but for the past three months the SEAI contractors have delivered 400 units per month, which is a significant increase. Mr. Deegan and the assistant secretary in this area met the suppliers in the past couple of weeks and they are absolutely up for this. The fact that the Government and the Oireachtas have given such certainty on the level of the funding means they can plan accordingly.

Mr. Griffin is right that the national development plan provides the funding base. We now have established the clear pipeline of the demand. The delivery bit is the bit in the middle. I have two questions around that. Does Mr. Griffin believe the SEAI has the capacity to deliver that extra demand? What is the Department doing for Irish contractors, and by going outside of Ireland, to try to secure an additional supply of people who would be able to carry out the retrofitting? I have one last question that is unfair to ask, so I will let Mr. Griffin answer. I will come back in the second round and be unfair to him then.

We have further sanction for further additional staff in the SEAI for 2023. It has geared up very significantly and we can see that in terms of its approach and the delivery. We have also beefed up the staff in the energy area in the Department. We had one assistant secretary in this area at the end of 2021, but we have three now. That recognises a number of things, such as the war in Ukraine and what we have to do there, as well as the impact that is having on energy prices and energy security. There is also a dedicated assistant secretary area within which Mr. Deegan works that is absolutely focused on delivering the retrofit programme. It has free rein to do whatever it needs to do and be as-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	111	The capacity is being dealt with in two ways. First, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs completed its work at the end of last year on the skills required for the green economy. We are doing much more around apprenticeships and we have five centres of excellence operational now that are geared towards delivering the skills required to support the retrofit programme through upskilling, reskilling and bringing in apprenticeships. With regard to the engagement with contractors, Mr. Deegan’s sense is that they themselves are now scaling up very significantly because of the certainty around the funding. I do not know if he wants me to add anything to that.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	114	I welcome the witnesses. I want to focus on two things. I will try to keep my questions focused and try to keep a bit of time to ask a second round of questions. Will Mr. Griffin give us the background on how much the national broadband backers have put in so far out of the €223 million that they committed to over the lifetime of this? What is the status of the Department’s evaluation of Asterion, the Spanish investor that is seeking to purchase an 80% stake? When is it likely to be approved or blocked? What role does the Minister have to play? Can Mr. Griffin tell us the value of the clawback to the State and the value of the returns to Oak Hill and Twin Point if the deal goes ahead? Do Granahan McCourt and the senior management earn a payout from the deal under the existing shareholder agreement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	115	I will deal with one of the questions and I will ask Mr. Mulligan to come in on the other two. The work on the evaluation of the proposed buy-in by Asterion is well advanced. We would expect that a decision could be made on that in the next number of weeks. We have used our external legal advisers, William Fry and EY, to support that work and we have done our own due diligence on it. That is a decision for the Minister under the contract, so the Minister would be the one who decides whether to proceed or not to proceed. I would expect that, in the next couple of weeks, that decision could be taken. On the amount that has been contributed from the €223 million, I will ask Mr. Mulligan to deal with that. Any uncommitted amounts, as well as the obligations under the contract if the Asterion deal is approved, would fall to the new structure to deliver, so there is no loss there.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	118	Yes, €120 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	119	On the value of the return to Oak Hill, I do not know whether we can make any comment on that yet or that we are even in possession of any figures.

The Minister has to give consent or not give consent before the actual sales process is concluded, so as that sales process would not be concluded yet, it would be inappropriate for anyone to comment on clawbacks, who made what or what contributions were made out of any deal.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	121	For example, would there be a payout to Granahan McCourt under the shareholder agreement? The witnesses do not have to tell me the amount but would that apply?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	122	Again, that depends on the close-out of the deal, which has not happened yet, and who gets paid what and where. They cannot close out a deal until the Minister makes a decision.

It is only three years since it was signed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	124	Without commenting too much on the deal, no, there would not be concern. The new investors coming in are very experienced telecoms investors, long-term investors. The fact that the exiting shareholders have sought to sell their shareholding of 80%, for us, just shows that the project is in a very good place in that people in the market - other investors - were willing to buy the company. To buy the company means the company has a very good future, a bright future. It is like selling a car, where, unless the car is in good condition, you will not sell it.

There was only one bidder for this contract and when it came down to it, people were put off from bidding. This is not the kind of scenario that some of them would have expected. There would have been people who were embedded in, and had expertise in, the market here but who then did not tender. This all seems very different from what the expectation was at the beginning.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	126	In the context of what was delivered in 2019, for us, there is no change in the senior management team. There will be a change in the board. There are nine members on the board and Twin Point Capital and Oak Hill would have three members on the board, so those three members will leave and three members from Asterion will come in, which means six members, including the Minister's appointee, remain. As to the experience of the senior management level, the CEO, Peter Hendrick, and David McCourt as chair of the board, nothing changes there and does not for the foreseeable future, so all the experience of the actual build programme remains.

I have some other questions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	129	There is a key point. The Deputy has been around this project through the procurement and she would have seen how it developed. A lot of entities looked at the project and considered getting involved but the risk profile did not suit the risk profile for their investment model.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	130	I want to move to other questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	131	I will conclude shortly. What the Deputy has to take from the current proposal is that we are three years into a contract and it is now a very different place from a project that did not have the start-up, did not have the designs, did not have any mobilisation and did not have 80,000 premises passed. We are seeing a difference there in terms of the nature of the investor that will look at a project like this. It is a vote of confidence in the project that an investment fund of that nature - a European investment fund - is interested in investing in the project. A key last point, just to finish-----

Unlike the sale of a commercial telecoms company that is not delivering on a contract like this, what that company, NBI, does in this case is set out in the contract, so whoever the owners of NBI are, they have the same obligations under the contract.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	136	I want to move to another topic. Ireland failed to apply for European funding on securing energy continuity. It looked like there was three days’ notice to make an application. Why did we not apply for REPowerEU for biomethane, for example, which from the point of view of the agriculture sector would be a natural asset? Have we applied for any other funding under this programme in regard to biomass, solar or wind? It seems extraordinary that there are only two countries that did not apply and we are one of them.

In my long experience in the Civil Service, I have never known Ireland not to put the hand out looking for EU money and we have been extraordinarily successful in that regard.

NCSC regulations set out what the roles are in terms of the entities maintaining their cyber posture at a sufficient standard and making sure controls and necessary cyber protections are in place. I had a quick glance at chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. The HSE acknowledged there were still a substantial number of pieces of IT infrastructure that were out of warranty, but that special arrangements were put in place to patch them and make them fit for purpose and that the necessary cybersecurity controls were in place to identify whether there were any incidents or vulnerabilities so that effective action could be taken.

The reality is, as I understand it from the operation of the HSE systems, from which I am at arm's-length, certain vital pieces of equipment are being operated using technology and legacy systems that are a bit dated, but the HSE plans to invest several hundred million euro and it has already invested significant sums to upgrade that infrastructure. The NCSC has worked closely with the HSE since the cyberattack, in terms of remediation and addressing the horrible criminal attack that was effected on the HSE, and in supporting it with its ongoing work.

In the latter three weeks, at the end of September, 10,000 premises were passed. Therefore, 10,000 premises were passed in a three-week period in comparison with 11,900 premises over an eight-week period. What is the reason for such discrepancies in pace?

I will ask Mr. Mulligan to give a far better explanation than that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	162	It is not straightforward; there are peaks and troughs. The first main exercise that happens in any deployment area is design activity, which is handed to Eir who would upgrade all the poles and ducts. Eir would pick an area, be it in Donegal or Cork, large or small, and have crews all over the country. Depending on the number of poles or ducts that need to be remediated, they are handed over to National Broadband Ireland, NBI. That figure could be 5,000 in one week and 2,000 in the next week, and so on and so forth. There are peaks and troughs based on the project management function. On average, 7,000 to 10,000 premises are being done a month. The figure could be 12,000 one month and 6,000 the next month. We review that internally in the Department with our build team when we review those plans. They are all based on concrete plans. It is not that staff were on holidays in July and August. It was a matter of the way the project was managed in terms of the build. It is a normal exercise in the building programme.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	164	No. We have actual targets. The target for the end of January 2023 is 102,000. NBI has said this week that this target will be achieved by the end of December. We are at a figure of 85,000 now, therefore, an additional 15,000 premises will be passed by the end of December. The NBI expects to get through 80,000 to 85,000 additional premises in 2023, which would be 7,000 on average per month.

The contract is worth €2.7 billion and the sanction of €150,000 is quite minimal relative to the size of the contract. On what basis was that sanction calculated?

We are in the early stages of applying sanctions. The Comptroller and Auditor General reported upward of €30,000 per build, with another €100,000 being notified to NBI, so that amounts to €230,000. This process of build sanctions will continue for the next five to six years as the build programme progresses. The other sanctions apply for 25 years. It is early days to be looking at it through the lens of how big or small a sanction is. The daily sanction is quite significant when-----

NBI got eight and a half months relief due to the Covid pandemic. As I said earlier, NBI is about three and a half months behind schedule and is catching up with that already. We have been told that for the target month of January, NBI will be a month ahead of schedule and targets for December will be met. In overall terms, it is early days to talk about the level of sanctions. I will not comment on future sanctions because NBI has not missed the targets yet and it is doing everything possible to achieve them.

They are as they should be, which is 130,000 premises, or whatever the figure will be going forward. The review mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to key performance indicators once the network is built, and so far that is €22,000.

We have not concluded those reports and the review, and we have not deducted them from the subsidy. I am not at liberty to say exactly what that figure will be. It is likely to be substantially more than €22,000 for this year.

Obviously, NBI’s main objective is to have no sanctions regarding those key performance indicators. It is to connect everybody on time and fix the network within a period of time. It is actually getting much better at that. I am quite optimistic, therefore, that it will have very few sanctions in the coming years regarding homes connected.

The Department of Education has to award a contract to what we call the retail service providers, such as Eircom, Vodafone or Sky, to deliver the internal wiring and Wi-Fi for each school, but NBI has made the physical connections to the walls of 470 schools.

We could have gone with a wireless connection for a number of the schools by the end of 2022, but the prudent thing was to hold over some of them until 2023, when they will be guaranteed a fibre connection.

The 679 schools were in the original 2019 plan, which envisaged delivery by 2026. A decision was made last year, because it is critical to have broadband in schools, to bring forward the deadline. In order to do that, we had to deploy a wireless network in the first instance to many of the schools. As the Secretary General said, this will be delivered by December, as promised. Some schools will get fibre because they are part of a deployment area that is to get fibre by next June, so it would have made no sense to supply a wireless network in parallel. That would have cost extra money.

It has been reported that a Spanish investor has an 80% stake in NBI. The State is entitled to 25% of any gain in excess of 25% of the value of the business at the time of a sale.

It is a commercial agreement between shareholders to buy and sell shares of the company. NBI is a stand-alone commercial entity owned by private investors.

That is allowed for under the contract subject to the Minister’s consent, which entails a process that we are going through at the moment. The Minister has not yet made a decision.

I was recently at an event celebrating Deputy Bruton’s 40 years in the Dáil. The first parliamentary question he ever submitted was on whether a particular constituent of his was going to get a telephone connection. The constituent had been waiting for more than three years for a connection. It looks like we are now facing the same scenario with broadband. I want to raise a number of issues. Reference was made to the fast-tracking of the connection of schools around the country. This is very welcome. I very much welcome the progress made in this area. Since there is now a substantial delay in the rolling out of broadband, especially in rural areas, is it not time to consider also the roll-out of additional community hubs? Has this possibility been examined? A large number of people who are now trying to work from home do not have access to broadband. If we rolled out many more community hubs, would it not be beneficial, especially if there is going to be a delay of three to four years in providing access in certain areas? Has this issue been looked at?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	224	I thank the Deputy. He is correct in saying the roll-out was delayed, but he is also correct in saying that people will be waiting for a number of years. This is a seven-year infrastructure build programme. It is guaranteeing that people will have access to a high-speed broadband network when it reaches them, and that will be for the 25 years, and really the 35 years, that the contract provides for. It is a long-term strategy to ensure the future for people. The broadband connection points comprised an element of the programme to recognise that, right across the country, the network roll-out would take seven years. Every county will see activity and have homes passed this year, but the majority of the network is yet to be built. The map of Ireland on which you can see where the broadband connection points are was an attempt to ensure that, throughout every county in Ireland, there would be somewhere, not too distant from where people are living, that they could access community-----

I raised this with Cork County Council and it said there was no more funding and that it was not going to get involved any further, meaning the issue was written off. I am saying we have a substantial delay. A large number of people who now want to work from home are prevented from doing so and have to travel 20 to 25 miles to and from work every day.We have many people now who wish to work from home, are prevented from doing so and must travel 20 to 25 miles to and from work daily. Having more community hubs or access points might help. We have done this fast-tracking of connections in the case of schools, why can we not do this in a community setting? We are talking about 679 schools where this facility will have been rolled out by the end of June. Why can we not also increase the number of hubs in local communities so people can work in them? People might only be only two or three miles away from a community facility they could drive to and work from.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	226	There is an openness to examining additional broadband connection points and hubs in general. Regarding earlier engagements and examples the Deputy raised, including that of Inishcarra, there has been action in this regard. The Deputy also said something that is key to this context and that is these facilities must be close to where people are living. A significant investment has been made in hubs outside of the NBP by the Department of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. This recognises that high-speed broadband is available in every village and town in Ireland from commercial operators and there has been significant growth in the number of hubs developed and receiving investment. In the context of the NBP, there is still an openness to taking an action if it can ensure a community can access high-speed broadband sooner.

I congratulate everybody involved in rolling out fast-tracked connections for schools. Now is the time to do the same for community hubs. Due to the impact of Covid-19 and of having to work from home, some people have been greatly frustrated and experienced many difficulties. Many people with young children now also want to work from home more so they have the associated flexibility. Therefore, I ask that this approach to fast-tracking connections be examined.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	228	If the secretariat could record that request as an action to be followed up by the Department, we can get the full list after this meeting. We will then respond specifically on this point, because it is one the Deputy has raised with us before.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	229	My second issue is also one I have raised before. I refer to the frustration in those areas which are borderline amber and blue. The blue areas are those where commercial entities are doing the connections. I have been told about several such situations in the last week alone. There is one area where the box that Eir has put in place is at the end of an avenue leading to a farm. That farmer is milking more than 350 cows. It is a major commercial operation. This farmer will not get connected because he is in the amber area. The likely connection date is the end of 2025. Likewise, a great many people have said similar things to me. One was a case where the pole where the box is based is halfway up an avenue to a farmyard, but because the farmyard itself is in the amber area it will not be connected, despite the pole sitting in the blue area. It does not make sense that there has not been engagement with the commercial companies in these instances where places are borderline. Can we do something to fast-track connections in those areas on the borderline between the amber and blue areas and where a premises might not be connected because it is on the wrong side of the road?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	230	In some instances, the Deputy is talking about a situation where a network simply ends. There will always be a next house where the network ends. If a commercial operator wishes to extend its operations, it can. If it does not, however, we cannot compel it to do so. The other instance, then, is one where a home is trapped within an area where there is a network. NBI has gone to and engaged with the market, and it is running a process that is due to conclude before the end of this year. It has asked commercial operators to come forward with proposed solutions for those infill premises in areas where there is existing infrastructure. Therefore, NBI is specifically actioning this aspect.

It has been stated it will be by the end of the year, but when can the process of implementing the connections then start? Are we talking about February and March, or later?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	232	We will have to wait for NBI to conclude that process and report on the proposals it received and the related practical usage in that regard. It will become clear before the end of this year where this process is going.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	233	The commercial operators' argument would be that NBI is getting so many thousands of euro per connection, whereas if those operators do the connections they will not. If those commercial operators have any additional costs, they will not get any more remuneration. I think this is their big argument for not doing these connections. It is extremely important that we try to expedite this process, especially because of the number of people now running their businesses from home. I ask that this endeavour be expedited and perhaps it might be possible for the representatives of the Department to come back to the committee by the end of February to let us know what progress has been made on this issue.

We have dealt with the schools issue. In the next month or two, can we get a breakdown of the numbers of premises connected? There is a difference between premises connected and the availability of services to those premises. Therefore, the committee needs to be provided with both those sets of figures. Perhaps sometimes people are not taking on offers, but we need to know the number of premises where the service is available and the number connected. We also need to see the number of people who have benefited, or an estimate, and a breakdown of the figures for farming and non-farming businesses. Can we get those figures as well? I ask because I think it is important that we get a breakdown of the connections in place. Can we also set out the targets for between now and January 2024? We had 34,000 premises connected in January 2022. Talking about January 2024, which will be two years on, what is the target for connections then? Perhaps it might be possible to get figures in this regard.

Relative to the picture when we were here last, however, the present situation is that 85,400 premises have been passed and 20,500 have been connected. We also have a target for the end of the year of 102,000, which will be the increase from the current 85,500. We also have a target for the end of 2023, which will be a cumulative 185,000 premises passed. As I said, the figure for premises connected is 20,500, and we are seeing connections now happening at 2,000 per month. Therefore, we can give the Deputy that information and we will aim to get to the statistics for the farm and non-farm businesses, etc.

To touch briefly on the REPowerEU plan, am I correct in saying that in response to Deputy Catherine Murphy it is essentially the evidence from the Department that no one here knows precisely why Ireland did not apply for this funding?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	244	Well, if we had taken the break now, I would have come back with an answer in ten minutes. I will, however, find out exactly what the position is.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	245	I assume Mr. Griffin will accept that this is concerning. The biomethane section of the REPowerEU budget alone has funding of €35 billion.

I just need to check it out and see what happened. If I cannot provide a coherent answer-----
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	247	I think Mr. Cleary might be able to answer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	248	I can give a bit of information and I am sure Mr. Griffin can provide more in ten minutes. Obviously, we in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have been involved with this project as well. It is not that we have lost out on anything here. The media piece that was referred to was correspondence the Department was seeking. There was no invitation to apply for funding on that. However, on 4 October, the Commission agreed that €20 billion worth of grants would be available for REPowerEU. Ireland’s allocation from that is expected to be around €89 million but that still needs to go to the Parliament and then to the Council, so the legislative proposal will not merge until next year and we will not have certainty on it until then. In the interim period, we will work with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to come up with funding proposals to meet that €89 million, and I would expect that biomethane will be part of that conversation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	252	Yes, it will be 0.45% or €89 million.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	253	The reports we have on the biomethane portion of REPowerEU suggest there was a budget of €35 billion and that Ireland had a potential funding stream of €800 million in capital funding. There is a discrepancy in that regard.

As I said-----

I appreciate we might get further information from Mr. Griffin later in the meeting. Was the Department aware of that proposal?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	256	This is not my area so I cannot say specifically, but my understanding is the April funding proposal was related to loanable funds as opposed to any grant funding, and often those loanable funds from the EU present little additionality in terms of their application in Ireland. As I said, my understanding is that what the Council agreed on 4 October is that there will be €20 billion worth of grants available, subject to the agreement of the Parliament and the Council, and Ireland's entitlement to that for grants will be 0.45%, or €89.6 million. We will then have to develop funding proposals-----

Pro rata, that would seem to be a much lower proportion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	260	It is because of the funding source of the €20 billion. The proposed funding source for the €20 billion is emissions trading system, ETS, revenues and these are going to be split so that 75% will come from the innovation fund and 25% from front-loading ETS allowances. With the innovation fund – bear in mind this is complex - a certain portion of ETS revenues, about 1% to 2%, are earmarked for innovation in what we might say are less developed EU member states. A chunk of the funding for this €20 billion is coming from a funding package that would previously have been available only to non-Ireland or other, mainly eastern European, member states. The entitlement to the €20 billion is not strictly pro rata with our population because of that funding source.

Perhaps that figure in respect of farms would give us a sense as to whether we are getting to the more peripheral areas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	270	That is not the way of working and, as Mr. Mulligan can attest, the way of working is defined more by deployment area, whereby we hit rural, suburban and semi-rural homes. It is dictated more by the roll-out from the Eir and the Enet hubs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	271	Yes. NBI is not doing a commercial roll-out, so it is not doing what another company would do whereby it would connect, say, 40,000 houses in one area and 4,000 houses in another area. Its build is dictated by where the local exchange is, and it is not addressing any villages. Everything it is doing is non-commercial, so there is no low-hanging fruit per se. As the Deputy knows, farms in all those areas outside villages are among all the other houses that are on the farm and around it, so it would be virtually impossible to identify an Eircode postcode for a farm and to bring fibre down the road specifically to connect that farm. It would make no sense to do that.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	272	I am not suggesting we would do that. The contract and the associated publicity clearly outlined a target of 54,000 farms, so I presume there is a way of measuring whether that is being done. I am not suggesting NBI is bypassing the neighbours of farms, but this would be useful information to have.

It is a high number.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	276	It is spread over the seven years of the build and, obviously, farms are in every county. It will be 2026 before some farms are connected but that figure of 7,000, as I recall, is around where it is at the moment. Ordnance Survey Ireland and its postcode database has the Eircode postcodes associated with farms, so every month, as farms are connected, we are able to know how many are connected.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	277	That information is available and it could be shared. An answer to my next question might also need to be included in the note from our guests. Mr. Griffin referred to rural, semi-rural and suburban premises. Of the premises that have been passed to date, is there a breakdown of the numbers within each of those three categories?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	278	I would not have it but we can try to get it from NBI.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	279	Yes. We do not internally report on this because the vast majority of those 25,000 connected premises are rural, so that is all the information we have. We can get back to the committee with some more information on their categorisation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	280	I think the figure that stands out in my head is that 80% of the premises connected under the national broadband plan are at least 1 km from the nearest village, whether that qualifies as rural, semi-rural or suburban.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	281	There are very few urban or suburban. The majority are absolutely rural and are well outside any village.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	283	The connectivity rate varies but what we are seeing is a 24% uptake, which is ahead of where we would have expected to be at this stage. On average, about 200 homes are being connected each month. The Deputy will be pleased to see his constituency is the highest in terms of take-up, with 35% in Cavan and 30% in Monaghan. Once people get it and are able to exit their existing contract, this is being taken up at a very considerable rate, which is really positive from our perspective. Overall, when we look at the numbers of premises nationally that are connected, the percentage take-up is 24%.

Has the Department or NBI carried out an assessment, whether through surveys or other methods, to identify why well over half of those premises that are being passed have not been connected?

What we are seeing on the ground is that some retailers are selling aggressively and customers do not automatically know that fibre is available. Sometimes, fibre is passing them on their roads but they are not aware that they can order or buy it even though there is a great deal of advertising.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	288	We are constantly working on what are called demand stimulation plans and determining what the best means of communicating the service are, for example, feet on the street, sending a van up a road to every house, door drops, local publicity in local newspapers, etc. All of these activities are under way in order to ensure that there is not a lack of awareness, but it still happens in a small number of cases, which means that people do not get connected until much later when they suddenly realise that they can get fibre. I was speaking on a pitch with a farmer in my local area where fibre had been available for three months. I told him that he could get fibre the next day if he wanted to. He had it the following week, but he had not known. There had been three or four door drops to his house. For whatever reason, people sometimes just do not realise it is available. As Mr. Griffin mentioned, people might be signed up for two-year contracts with Imagine, Eircom or another provider and have to wait until next year to get out of those contracts. If they move early, they will have to pay twice - once to NBI and once to the other operator. This causes a lag in getting from 30% to 60%, but there is an optimistic scenario of at least 80% to 85% of people in the areas in question being connected by 2026 or 2027. It is incremental. According to NBI, 25,000 will be connected by December. It expects at least another 25,000 connections by the end of next year. It is connecting 2,000 per month at the moment. That will soon increase to 3,000 per month. The connections are going well and the connection process for the end user is also going well. There have been no complaints about engineers doing a bad job, not arriving, walking away or anything like that. Someone gets an appointment and has 500 Mbps on the day the connection is made.

The original targets were 115,000 premises by January 2022 and 204,000 by January 2023. It has been confirmed that 85,000 premises should be passed by then. There were remedial targets. The targets were then changed and reduced to 60,000 by January 2022 but NBI had only passed 34,000 premises at that stage, which was 30% of the original target. NBI set the targets. If the targets are not to the satisfaction of the Department, it can raise that with NBI. What power has the Department to force NBI to revise its targets upwards if the Department is not happy with them? I ask the officials to keep their answers brief because I have a number of questions on this matter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	291	On the targets, it is not necessarily that NBI can independently set a target and whatever it is, it is. It set a target in 2019 of seven years to complete the build. The contract, as of 2019, is still in place. If NBI misses that target, it is sanctioned. That is an important point to make.

I am asking a very direct question.

However, Covid did not respect that because people who were contractors in vans got Covid and people were close contacts of those who got Covid. That had an absolutely unbelievable effect on the value chain. These were not only NBI people but all the people working for Eir on the make-ready who were all similar contractors, like KN Circet, Actavo, Gaeltec, TLI Group and all the contractors throughout the country. There are about 1,500 men and women working on this across every county. No county was left outside the Covid box.

It owns much of the ducting and poles. The original intervention area included 750,000 premises. The Minister and Government decided to pick about 220,000, as I recall.

I would call them lower-hanging fruit. I can identify blue areas on the map where the roll-out happened. That presents a significant difficulty. It mainly picked up the fringes of towns and villages and heavily-populated clusters of ribbon development on the outskirts of towns, maybe a mile up the road. Through this scheme, the taxpayer was going to have to pay for that and also for ducting. Mr. Mulligan confirmed at previous meetings that there are many problems with ducts being blocked. Many photographs have been taken and there are extensive dossiers of information about this. Eir essentially controls the speed at which this will be rolled out.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	315	There is no doubt about that. It has to remediate all the poles and ducting. Approximately 40,000 poles have been remediated by Eircom over the past two or three years under the national broadband plan. I would like to note an important point about the 300,000 that Eircom provided for, to its credit. The commitment agreement was signed in 2017, as the Chair said. The Minister gave Eircom a detailed plan over two years to get more than 300,000 homes connected to high-speed broadband. That happened before Covid. In the end, it passed 340,000 premises. There is no doubt in our minds that it would probably not have happened without the national broadband plan. Before Covid, more than 340,000 premises in predominantly rural areas, in every village in Ireland, had access to fibre to the home.

Why were those areas ever included in a broadband plan to be funded by the taxpayer when they could be serviced commercially? It is obvious from looking at the maps. The easiest way to do it is to look at an area one is familiar with. One can then identify exactly where a commercial operator could have done it. In Clonkeen in Portlaoise, for example, there were easy pickings, with rows of houses in a rural area to be picked up commercially.

We cannot undo that now. I have articulated some of that again today. It has been allowed to retrospectively reduce the original target from 8,000 to zero passed in January 2021. It missed its original targets, reaching half, at best, by the end of this year. It has negotiated remedial targets, which it has also missed. Mr. Mulligan says it will meet its negotiated remedial targets, but there is a question about that. It got the Department to review 39 performance indicators that were signed in 2019. We are less than three years into this, which is a short time. All the Department has done is impose a sanction of €134,000, which NBI might get back, in the context of a contract where the taxpayer will potentially stump up €2.7 billion. I am looking at this in the round. Mr. Mulligan confirmed that another €100,000 will be levied. I understand he cannot look into the future. When he looks at those five or six facts, it looks to me as if the taxpayer and State are being swung around.

The delays in the building have had a significant impact on its business because it does not get the subsidy from the State and because it is not connecting customers as quickly as it would like. Its investors are clearly worried about that and are putting significant pressure on the company to go faster. The company's primary concern would be that it is not building quickly enough, not that it is getting sanctioned. The sanction would be a secondary concern.

I am looking at an email from an assistant principal officer in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications who is responsible for gas networks. It is dated 1 April 2022. It is addressed to the competent authority for gas networks. The Department was notified about this programme on 8 March. The email was sent on 1 April, with a notification that a reply would be required by 5 April. It asked if there was a national plan to boost the deployment and connection to gas networks of biomethane. It goes on to specify that the extra volumes can be delivered by October 2022 or March 2023. This was to get a quick turnaround to replace gas that is no longer available from Russia because of the war. The email I am looking at dealt with that specifically. Mr. Cleary said in response that it would require legislation. The article in the Irish Examiner that dealt with this matter stated: "However, gas industry experts have told the Irish Examiner that no such legislation is required for either the biomethane or liquefied natural gas strands of REPowerEU." We know there are different funding proposals from the EU as well as our domestic funding proposal. Mr. Griffin referred to two funding programmes that are being put forward for REPowerEU. Does the €81 million or €89 million cover both of these? I am not quite sure of the amount. Is that separate?

I cannot recall precisely what the second project related to EU. I undertook, while the Deputy was still in the room, to come back with a comprehensive answer about where things are with this stream of funding, projects that have or have not been put forward and where we stand on the potential receipt of moneys from the EU to support projects such as the one the Deputy outlined. Biomethane is an important part of our climate action plan. It is referred to in the plan. We want to significantly increase the volume of biomethane being pumped into the national gas network. We want to increase the level of anaerobic digestion on farms. That was discussed when we were setting the sectoral emission ceilings at the end of July. This is an important issue.We will follow up and we will provide the Deputy with a very comprehensive response.

I have to say I still feel that this should have been on the Department's radar, given it has responded to news articles and there is a source from the Department. I will ask Mr. Griffin about the deferred surrender. Obviously if the Department spends something, it does not get value for money, but not spending money that has been allocated to something that absolutely requires to be done is just as big an issue with regard to value for money. It looks as though the Department failed to utilised €266 million or 40% of its voted expenditure in 2021. Does Mr. Griffin regard that as value for money, when reaching the far end of the year? When did he notice this money would not be spent? How is it tracked? Will he elaborate further on the areas where it was underspent and why?

We get many targets and then those targets are not met. It has almost become routine at this stage. Is there a paucity of ambition? Is there an impediment to the application process? What are the impediments?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	344	I saw no impediment with regard to the ambition within the organisation nor with regard to staffing over the past couple of years because we have increased it very significantly. I saw no impediment in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, because it has increased its ambition significantly. We have a clear line of sight on our spend out to 2030 and we know what the annual allocations will be. It is very difficult to manage the sort of stop-start situation that occurs when faced with Covid. Bear in mind that in some of the programmes, such as the warmer homes programme, one is dealing with a very vulnerable cohort, many of whom are elderly people. Even though it was halted from January to mid-April, it was probably some period after that before we could get back on track.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	346	I will ask Mr. Deegan to deal with the figures in a moment. During the course of 2021, which was a difficult year, we delivered approximately 15,500 units. We will deliver between 26,000 and 27,000 units during the course of 2022. The target for 2023 is 37,000 units. One is seeing a very significant increase. Bear in mind that the depth of the interventions that have been made over the past number of years have increased significantly. We are moving far more from shallow retrofit to deeper retrofit. I take the view that one is at risk of compromising value for money where one forces or seeks to force delivery at a point in time when one knows it will not represent value for money. We have seen, with regard to the retrofit programme, the ingredients of having a programme that will deliver much more with value for money, has been much improved in the latter half of 2021. We have the national development plan, NDP. We have the national retrofit plan which sets out how we will do our business. New scheme conditions were announced at the start of this year and we have the report of the expert group on future skills needs. All of that will play a very significant part in ensuring that, first, we can deliver and, second, we can deliver with a value-for-money focus.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	347	The total budget allocation for last year was €221.5 million and the expenditure was €101 million. As the Secretary General outlined, the primary driver of the underspend was the Covid-related restrictions, which was not only affected by the shut-down of the construction sector and not being able to go into people's houses, but the knock-on impact on the supply chain and getting the sector back up to speed. The good news is that since the publication of the retrofit plan and the NDP, things have really picked up this year. We are implementing the plan and it is making a difference. We are seeing very strong interest and demand. Figures for the end of August show that more than 30,000 applications for support were made, which is up 140% year on year; 13,400 home energy upgrades were completed, which is up 70% year on year; 4,250 of the completions were B2s; and 2,800 homes were completed under the warmer homes scheme. We are seeing real deliver now. The plan is in place, the money is behind it, the demand-generation campaigns are having effect and we are knocking down the blockers about which the Deputy spoke as much as possible. There will then be new initiatives. When we see new barriers coming up, we will introduce new initiatives for next year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	401	I understand from where the Chairman is coming and I will do my best to provide a comprehensive response. When NBI gets to the detailed design for an area, that is at a point when there would be greater clarity as to whether another operator is now in the area. What we have to ensure in that regard, however, is that nobody in the intervention area is left without a high-speed broadband service. A critical point is that where other operators build and encroach on the area, they have given no commitment in that regard, whereas in the case of the 300,000 premises that were taken off the map, the operators had to commit to passing and connecting all of those addresses.One could find infrastructure in an area where the majority of people - 100 out of 130 - in a hinterland could get access to it. NBI will still have to hit the remaining 30. What one has to look at there is whether NBI, in reaching the 30, will have to effectively get through where the other 100 are and incur that cost. If that is the case, the public interest is best served by them selling services to those 100 premises for which they will have to incur the cost of overbuild. Practical solutions can be arrived at. For example, in the University of Limerick, HEAnet has rolled out a high-speed broadband network. NBI will now not go in there spending taxpayers' money to duplicate a network when there is 100% certainty that the need is being met.

The orange area is the intervention area and the taxpayer or the State is putting up 90% of the cash. The point I am making is we find ourselves in a situation where another operator, which has a dominant position by virtue of the fact that it controls the highways - the main arteries out through the national broadband network - as one can see from the maps, has now got there first. We will not build there but yet in part of that area the liability will still wind up with 90% of it being on the taxpayer to pay.

The 537,000 premises, which is now 560,000 premises, is what NBI is contracted to deliver. What I am saying is that that map is dynamic. The contract allows for changes to that where the Department agrees to that. Clearly, we would only agree to that where it was in the public interest to do so.

I would make two quick points. First, NBI is not proposing to reduce the scale of its intervention on the basis of any encroachment that is seen but that is looked at on an deployment-area-by-deployment-area basis when one gets to the low-level design. Second, NBI has confirmed that where such encroachment has occurred, it does not intend to seek access to the €100 million pot that is there as part of the €2.7 billion. We are confidence that that €2.7 billion is effectively €2.6 billion because that €100 million will never be sought.

Somebody asked Mr. Griffin if work has been done to understand why people are not connecting. If I remember rightly, the Analysys Mason indicated there was an issue in relation to transparency to do with the metropolitan area networks, MANs, the first broadband initiative. That report was on the Minister's desk for a year. When it was published, my recollection is that there was a proposal to cut in half the price of broadband to the suppliers. That, in turn, makes it cheaper for people to take up broadband or to have the direct connection. Obviously, the cost of living is a big issue. I remember there being a review recommended within that. What work is happening in that regard? Does that extend beyond the MANs, in the context of transparency, for example, to NBI, to the suppliers below that and what their costs are and to the cost to the individual?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	419	I will ask Mr. Ó hÓbáin to come in on this. My recollection is that there was a review undertaken by Analysys Mason to look at pricing and a number of other issues in respect of the MANs, in particular how the pricing affected connected companies. That review was completed and 13 recommendations were made. The then Minister, Deputy Bruton, referred it to ComReg to review. ComReg got PwC to assist. The report was published. The 13 recommendations were implemented. As part of that, one of the issues that was found during the course of the review was it was hard to establish what a reasonable benchmark would be for the cost of dark fibre but in the heel of the hunt, Enet reduced the cost of dark fibre to €2.60 per metre. There was a substantial reduction in dark fibre. The cost of fibre under the national broadband plan in the intervention area and all the other commercial areas that are being upgraded at present is a matter for the market. One of the advantages, from the perspective of the national broadband plan, I think I am right in saying, is that they have bought forward in very substantial terms the stock of fibre to be rolled out on the network. I do not know if there is anything further on the MANs.

Will they be able to afford it? We understand that they will be charged the same to bring it to a certain point. If, however, it is only outside their door, for example, and there is a minimum charge of approximately €100 to connect, the reason they are not connecting may well be because it will add to the cost.

We have it at both - in terms of the connection but also in terms of the price being charged in rural areas relative to urban areas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	423	It was always envisaged from 2015, when the initial intervention strategy was published, that this rural intervention would ensure that there was parity of prices across the entire country. In Dublin, Cork and Donegal, the average broadband rental price is approximately €50. What we have seen on the NBP is that, with 45 retail providers, there is a lot of competition and the entry price is approximately €30 for broadband. Then, a year later, it might go up to €40 or €50. The entry price point is very affordable from that perspective and people are getting a great deal because there is lots of competition. The entry connection charge is €100. We have ensured that under the contract that is affordable regardless of the cost of connecting. Back to the cost of connecting, where there is remedial work of someone's duct in the garden or they need a new pole in the garden, that is funded through the connection subsidy regime under this contract. This ensures that when anyone else makes an order, he or she will definitely get connected. That is a challenge for the commercial sector because in the commercial sector sometimes the business case is not there to connect that home or business where there is a lot of remedial work to be done inside the wall of the house. The national broadband plan area is making sure it is affordable.

I received a reply to a parliamentary question on 25 May from the Minister with regard to this. To be honest, I was a bit taken aback by the reply. It outlined the number of homes that were upgraded. These figures were for the first four months. I asked for the figures for 2022. The reply outlined to me the figures for 2021 and also the figures for January to the end of April 2022, which was helpful. A couple of things stood out. The better energy warmer homes scheme had 2,126 done in all of 2021. In the first four months of this year, 1,133 homes were done. The better energy warmth and well-being scheme just had 69 done in the first four months of this year. The figure that really jumped out at me was for the deep retrofits. Ten deep retrofits were done in 2021. In the first four months of this year, there were absolutely none. It is the same with the community energy grants. I understand that these can be bigger and there may be reasons for that due to it being a bigger piece of work. The national home retrofit scheme one-stop shop, which is for the really deep retrofits, had 805 completed in 2021 with 188 completed in the first four months of this year. There were ten deep retrofits done in the whole of last year and none completed in the first four months of this year. Will Mr. Deegan respond to that please?

They are just closing out the existing applications that were carried over that were not able to be completed in previous years. That would apply to the warmth and well-being scheme, which was always a relatively small scheme.

The community energy grant scheme, which the Chairman mentioned, was quite low in the first four months of the year. That has gone up and we expect it to go up quite significantly towards the end of the year because of the way the application process and delivery process is. One applies at the start of the year and it delivers by the end of the calendar year. The one-stop shop scheme was launched in February so we are now starting to see the houses coming through at the other end of that. They are significant project projects that take a number of months to deliver.

On the shallow retrofits, I am looking at a table based on figures from 2010 up to the end of 2019, as supplied by the SEAI to my colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke. In 2011 there were 51,557 shallow retrofits done. The same corresponding figure decreases every year right the way down along to 2018 and 2019. In 2019 it went down to 7,562 for shallow retrofits. Cavity wall projects went from 41,000 in 2011 down to 636 last year. The 2021 figure is very concerning. In 2011 roof attic insulation went from 51,000 down to 4,700 in 2021. The very important cavity wall insulation went from 41,000 down to 3,726. What is happening behind those figures? I am looking across a decade when everyone was talking about retrofit and everyone saw the need to get this going to reduce energy consumption and meet our climate change targets. It was also to reduce energy bills and make homes more comfortable for people. What happened there? Why have we gone from 41,000 cavity wall insulation retrofits ten years ago to only doing 3,700 last year?

In February of this year these were enhanced. One can start seeing the impact of those enhanced grant rates for cavity and attic insulation in the activity so far. On both of those measures we are up 300% on what we were doing last year in actual delivery. We are seeing that the interventions we have made around the supports that are now available to homeowners-----

There are an awful lot of homes with single glazing. I am not clear on it but I looked at the grants quickly again on Monday. With the single glazing there are a number of homes still generally falling in this regard, and it seems to be older people, people who are on lower incomes, or maybe older people who are working but just cannot afford to take out the single-glazed windows. The heat and the energy is flying out through them. Which grant do they come under? Is it the 80% one? Can a person get double glazing under that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	451	If we were giving 80% grants for double glazing we would have a queue as long as the country. There are grants available for windows and doors under the one-stop shop scheme whereby it is part of an overall package. They are not supported under individual measures. On the most impact for those households the Chairman refers to, there is a reason cavity and attic insulation was chosen. These are the most impactful measures at very low cost in the context of cost effectiveness and value for money. These are the measures that people should be investing in. It is an average of 80% in some houses, but in smaller houses it is actually more on a percentage basis.

They were made available also under the "free", for want of a better word, scheme which is the warmer homes scheme. They were made available under that. Is that still the case? Could we advise constituents to apply for it under the warmer homes scheme if they still have single glazing? They do not have to have health problems or anything like that?

We have a long-term energy strategy that we have just published for public consultation that looks at gas and energy security of supply. That is out for public consultation to look at what we need to do on the gas and electricity fronts, having regard to the fact that we are an island nation and the UK is no longer a member of the EU. In fact, we did an energy White Paper in 2007 and another in 2015. Short-term, medium-term and long-term energy planning is, therefore, a constant issue for the Department and one we take very seriously.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	460	Over the last 12 years, it would appear that if we were doing it, we were not doing it very effectively because we finished up in a situation where demand has increased because population has increased. In addition, data centres, industry, employment increases, car charging and heat pumps in houses all place new demands on electricity. Mr. Griffin would have heard me talk about some of these issues five or six years ago. I was trying to figure out in my head, and I am still trying to figure out, where the dispatchable power comes from. He will recall me telling the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that if the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, that knocks out the solar panels and wind turbines, which I think are good. I still have concerns about dispatchable power, however. The only way that I can see we can work with dispatchable power is through gas, which many people are not in favour of as a transition fuel, and biomass, which they were not in favour of up until recently, although they seem to be changing their minds. Biomass was completely ruled out but people are now in favour of it and can apparently talk about it for half an hour. This is all welcome. However, where is the dispatchable power over the next decade? Are there opportunities to drill for more gas in Corrib or other locations?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	461	The way the system operates is that EirGrid produces a generation capacity statement every year that looks out ten years and sets out the expectation in terms of the demand ask and the expectation in terms of supply if, for example, some plant goes off the system or a new plant comes on through the auction process. It will identify a gap. Those studies are in the public domain. For dispatchable generation, there is a capacity remuneration mechanism that provides for auctions to be undertaken and companies to bid in, whether they are State sector companies like ESB or Bord na Móna or private sector companies like Energia, SSE Airtricity or EPUK Investments. They will bid in. That mechanism is, therefore, in place. Clearly, over the last couple of years we have seen the supply-demand gap not being reconciled for a variety of reasons. The Government has made it clear - a policy statement was produced last September, although I could have gotten the month wrong, which makes it crystal clear - that there is a need for 2,000 MW of dispatchable generation between now and 2030.

A constituent raised this issue with me and it is also going around inside my head. Where are we going to get that from? That is what I want to know, in short. I know it is the burden of policy but it can be very difficult for us to get answers to these questions. We are given something like one minute on the floor of the Dáil. I am trying to get information from Mr. Griffin, as Secretary General of the Department, because he is obviously in the know on this. My concern, in the first instance, is that the lights do not go out and there will be power for homes, industries, hospitals, schools and everything else over the coming few years. Where will it come from? Is there potential to use more gas? Mr. Griffin knows my line with regard to biogas. We have an agricultural waste problem. We are playing catch-up with this. We should have been doing it ten years ago. I was told up to a few years ago that it was too expensive. Now, it can be produced more cheaply. Obviously, because electricity has gone up in price, it can be produced cost-effectively, which would solve our agricultural waste problem and also generate money for farmers. In short, can Mr. Griffin tell me where this extra demand will come from?

The regulator and EirGrid manage that process. The issues raised by the Chairman regarding biomethane and hydrogen will all form part of the mix. The key part from our perspective is that the gas generation that will be brought onto the system over the next number of years should, ideally, be methane and hydrogen-ready so that when we get the biomethane on the system, it will be more economic. The Chairman is right about the costs of this. When we look at biomethane in terms of the climate action plan, and when we consider the way the price of natural gas, which is very expensive, has gone over the last year or two and what the expectations are for the future, we see that it has become far more economic. Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy raised anaerobic digestion as potentially a big-income generator for the farming community. Producing biomethane that can be injected into the national gas network needs to be part of the mix.

I saw a figure in the briefing notes where it is projected that the availability of wood biomass will increase by 100% by 2030.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	467	We need to look at biomass, on which there are different views. The EU directive on indirect land use change requires certain conditionality to be met in terms of the source of the biomass. It is potentially part of the solution, however. The Chairman is right that the canvas here is very complex and we find it moving every day, particularly over the course of the last year. I am quite happy to come back with a detailed note in an annex to our response to the committee subsequent to this meeting.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	468	Up to last year, we could not use construction wood waste in this State. We could be shipping some over the Border, however. It is allowed to be used in that jurisdiction. I ask the Department to look at that area. It does not make sense that we cannot use material from another jurisdiction, particularly when there is a large construction sector here at the moment. That should be used in terms of a supply of biomass. It does not make sense. Industry representatives - people who are trying to increase the use of biomass - have raised that issue with me. I will make a point about Bord na Móna and the ESB. We are lucky to have them. I know people have a big issue with the profit made by the ESB in the first six months of the year. It is not going to disappear. It is there because we owned it. The profit will be reinvested or there will be a big dividend. That is for the Minister as it is a matter of policy on Government clawback, etc. That is in place. Bord na Móna is trying to get into, and is
in, the process. It has gone from a company on which the gate was nearly closed to what it is today. It had to pay a dividend. Taxpayers need to hear that it paid a small dividend to the State last year. It has the potential to do an awful lot of this heavy lifting for us. All I will say - again, it will be a policy matter - is that from an official point of view, the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Public Expenditure and Reform, etc., should give Bord na Móna a wide berth. It took out a one-page advertisement for jobs recently in the local press in the midlands. That is some change from where it was a couple of years ago when the gate was nearly locked. I want to acknowledge that. I know that perhaps the Department's officials sometimes did not get credit for the work they did. We criticise them sometimes but I want to acknowledge that. That took a lot of work. Many pieces had to be moved around.

The work that has been done by the company over the last few years with the support of the local politicians, and by the Government, is phenomenal. The shift from brown to green, and Bord na Móna's ambition around renewable energy and how it is delivering on the renewable energy front, is extraordinary. It is great to see.

I just want to highlight that.It is a question of policy but from an official point of view we should do anything that can be done to accelerate that. We will see jobs and power coming over the next few years as that starts to work itself out. We need to drive that on with gusto; do not mind the ideology or anything like that. Bord na Móna and the ESB can increase their share of it. I have made the same comment to the people in government as well. Whoever is in government needs to do that.  We require some information from the witnesses. We have covered wide areas such as the SEAI grants and broadband. These are the two biggest spending areas and they are going to increase. It is evident why there is intense interest from committee members in it. I thank the witnesses from the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Public Expenditure and Reform for attending today, and the committee's staff for preparing for the meeting. I also thank Mr. McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and Ms Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, for attending, and also their staff for their background information and briefing notes. Is it agreed that the clerk to the committee can seek any follow-up information and carry out the agreed action? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefing provided for today's meeting? Agreed.

The first item is minutes from the meeting dated 6 October 2022, which have been circulated. Do members wish to raise any matter regarding the minutes? Are the minutes agreed to? Agreed. As usual, they will be published on the committee's web page. Five sets of accounts were laid before the House between 3 and 7 October. I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address them before opening the discussion to the floor.

I issued a clear audit opinion. The second set of accounts are the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA's, for 2021. I issued a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal control where attention had been drawn to the results of a European Commission audit that identified significant shortcomings in the weighing and reporting of pelagic fish landings and the lack of controls and-or enforcement over catches of bluefish and tuna. The working out of the implications of this is still in progress and there is an interim arrangement in place, by agreement with the Commission, up to the end of this year. The third set of accounts are the Marine Institute's for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. The fourth set of accounts are the Office of the Ombudsman for Children's for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. The fifth set of accounts are the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board's for 2021. The accounts received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with procurement rules.

It would be worthwhile if we wrote to the Department on this matter. It is the kind of situation that could result in fines if not addressed. Things tend to happen at the 11th hour, but there is a bit of time to do something about it now. I assume that this also affects conservation matters. Could we write to the Department? It might set out the problematic issues for us and tell us how it intends to ensure that this situation is addressed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	482	We are following it up. Many of the organisations in respect of which we have drawn attention to non-compliance are taking steps. It can be difficult to sort out in 12 months something that may be long entrenched. Some initiatives are being taken centrally by ETBs together.All in all, it is something we will keep an eye on. If the matter persists and the non-compliant procurement in the following year is over €500,000 I will draw attention to it again.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	483	The ETBs have advised us in the past that there is a problem, particularly for smaller ones, in that they may not have dedicated staff to deal solely with procurement, just because of scale. That tends to be a problem.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	484	It does but an ETB is quite a sizeable organisation. We only have 16 of them now as opposed to the VECs, which would have been on smaller budgets. Given the scale of procurement in these organisations, you would expect a professional procurement officer to be in place. As they work together and develop systems together through ETBI, I would expect them to be taking initiatives generally to deal with these problems.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	485	Okay. We will note the listing of financial statements. Is that agreed? Agreed. As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of the minutes. We will move on to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee on correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s web page. The first category is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings. No. 1487B is correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, the cathaoirleach of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 30 September 2022. It is a quarterly update requested by the committee regarding Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street, Dublin 2. In 2017, the OPW entered into a 25-year lease at Miesian Plaza, which houses the Department of Health and staff of some other Departments. The OPW’s mismeasurement of the floor space for the building gave rise to a forecasted overpayment of about €10 million during the lifetime of the lease. In October 2018, the OPW stated that it was negotiating with the owner of the premises in an attempt to have the floor space measurements upon which the lease is based recalibrated. The issue was highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2017 report on the accounts of the public services and examined by the previous Committee of Public Accounts in October 2018. This committee also reported on the matter in May 2021. This correspondence details an agreement in principle between the landlord and the OPW that will go some way towards limiting taxpayers’ exposure to the loss of about €10 million. The chairman states, "it has been agreed between the parties to extend the lease on Miesian Plaza by a period of 9 months at a nominal rent of €10 per annum". The lease was entered into at a contracted rate of €10 million per annum, subject to review every five years. The agreement would potentially claw back about €7.5 million of the expected overpayment. While that is welcome, it appears that the taxpayer will still be out of pocket by €2 million or thereabouts. It would be interesting to know if the rent review took place before the agreement and, if so, what the current rate is. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? As agreed last week, we intend to schedule a meeting with the OPW before the end of the year. Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item for discussion.

There was an error in how the floor space was calculated and that is how this issue arose. Am I right in understanding that there is some degree of retrospection on this? I would have thought that would have been part of it. This just went on and on. Has there been any retrospection or is this just from now on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	487	As I understand it, it has been agreed that at the end of the lease, there will be a period where no rent or a peppercorn rent will be paid. That, effectively, is the offset for the overmeasurement. The OPW will continue to pay under the existing lease terms and at the end of that it can stay on longer in the building at a peppercorn rent for a period.

That lease was for 25 years. It was a very long lease.

It is a legal agreement. It is very hard to change leases or legal agreements when they are in place. People are dependent, to a certain degree, on negotiations and goodwill. It is an improvement on the way things were but it does not go the whole way.

The Comptroller and Auditor General should be commended on highlighting this issue, as well as the members of the previous committee and this current committee, who have been dogged in pursuing the issue. At the end of the day, there will still be €3 million lost because somebody miscalculated the floor space of the building. It was a simple mistake that was not corrected. My difficulty with all of this is that, as per usual, it does not appear anybody is going to be held to account. In our correspondence with the OPW in advance of it coming before us, we should ask what mechanisms it is employing to identify the source of this debacle and what internal actions are being taken to ensure something like this can never happen again. Whatever way you look at it, this has been an absolute mess that does no service whatsoever to the OPW or its reputation.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	491	We can ask the OPW that. It is an issue we have teased out with it at previous meetings and the previous committee would have dealt with it as well. We have raised this. The Deputy is correct that any improvement is welcome. What is important to ask now is what steps have been taken at this point. We have addressed with the OPW previously the need to put measures in place to make sure the quantity surveyors are getting the figures right for properties that are being bought or leased by the State. I suggest that we write to Mr. Buckley and ask him what specific measures have been taken to minimise the risk of this happening again. Would that satisfy the Deputies?

Tthe OPW ended up having to pay the interest at way above the bank interest rate for the full six years when it finally found it had a binding contract to comply with.

The sale did not close and it dragged on for six years. Eventually the OPW agreed it should proceed with the purchase of the premises and ended up paying six years of interest. The question raised then was who made the decision not to proceed six years earlier. It was the taxpayers who picked up the interest and the interest rate on the contract was way above the normal bank interest rate, so the State got caught twice, with double the amount in real terms. Again there is a question there about accountability. The important thing is that we are writing to the OPW now. We need to be reassured that there are checks and balances there to make sure something like this does not arise again.

The OPW is due to come before us in the very near future. If the Deputy wants, he can hold onto that issue until that day and ask-----

We will ask about the reasons for this and what steps are being taken to avoid that sort of situation arising again. We will also ask about the quantity surveying work on properties the office is leasing and renting. We will have a reply before our next meeting with the OPW, which may be helpful to the Deputy. Is that okay?

Okay. The next item of correspondence is from Mr. Kevin McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. It is dated 27 September 2022 and provides information requested by the committee regarding international protection accommodation. Members might recall that certain functions transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in October 2020. Contracts related to the provision of accommodation for international protection applicants were adjudged by the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice to have undergone a competitive procurement process. However, the Accounting Officer of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth took the view that, while they were competitive, they did “not comply with national and EU procurement directives and guidelines, irrespective of whether the procurement was ‘competitive’ in the everyday understanding of the term". The contracts, with a combined value of over €91 million, were therefore included in the Department’s Circular 40 of 2002 return, which details procurement that, for exceptional reasons, did not to involve a competitive tender. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will come before us in two weeks' time, on 27 October. Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this for discussion.

We all know there is a housing crisis. At the same time, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to cease direct provision or to work towards its cessation. This response tells us that 11 contracts involving 1,295 additional beds have been secured through this process so, in actual fact, we are going the other direction. I know there are extra burdens with regard to finding accommodation because of the war in Ukraine. Has the strategy to accommodate people been informed by the expert advisory group appointed by the Minister on foot of the White Paper on direct provision? I would like to see where we are on this. There are people in direct provision who now have status but who cannot move out because there is no accommodation for them to move into. There is a strategy but it is going in the reverse of the direction that was in the White Paper. It is important that we understand whether this has been discussed by the external advisory group.

There were then people in direct provision who had been through the process and this commitment was made even at that point so it is not the case that it was unknown.

#JamesOConnor	unknown-#JamesOConnor-party	unknown-#JamesOConnor-dob	unknown-#JamesOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	510	Gabh mo leithscéal. To add to the Deputy's points, there are a lot of outstanding questions in this area but, with regard to the analysis of the approximately 1,300 additional beds, I would like to get a better sense from the Department of how the contracts were awarded to different operators. We have seen substantial growth in the acquisition of hotels that have now been turned into de facto direct provision accommodation. The lack of information on the awarding of those contracts is quite worrying. There has not really been any proper in-depth analysis of this within the Oireachtas. There is a very significant amount of public money involved and it is important that we delve into this. It is so lucrative that hotels and former nursing homes are being purchased by private operators that are making exceptionally high profits. The Committee of Public Accounts needs to have a look at this and some analysis from the Department is needed to get further information. The demand is increasing as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and changes to the rules for obtaining refugee status in the United Kingdom and the additional investment and budget for the acquisition of properties under State-funded contracts for emergency accommodation to provide for people coming into the country under the existing mechanism is going unchecked. There is an urgent need for the Committee of Public Accounts to look at this issue. It would be very beneficial to put it on the work programme.

We have had a few discussions on this. It is on the work programme for two weeks from today. We will actually have that Department in. The very reason we are bringing it in is because of the issues the Deputy has raised including the volume of work being done with the Department and the number of people in emergency accommodation, including people from Ukraine and people seeking international protection. Deputy O'Connor is right; a very significant number of contracts to provide this accommodation are being negotiated and signed. I hope that, on that day, we can get a good insight into what is going on. If there are particular areas or questions the Deputy would like to raise with the Department, he should send them to the clerk of the committee because we can then give the Department advance notice so it can have detailed information for him on them.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	513	Deputy Catherine Murphy had a specific proposal.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	514	Yes. The nub of the question is whether the external advisory group was informed. On the point Deputy O'Connor has made, which I support, we should not just ask about the provision of space and premises, but about the operators brought in to run the services. There are two aspects to the matter.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	515	We will ask the secretariat to include in the invite we send that we wish to discuss the entities that are providing accommodation and those providing services to people within that accommodation. I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for that. That is agreed so we will move on to category C, correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence. There is only one item, No. 1488C, which is from an individual and dated 3 October 2022. It alleges that, during 2021 and before, unspecified section 38 and 39 organisations were insolvent. Section 38 and 39 organisations provide services for the HSE. Approximately €5.7 billion in health funding goes to these organisations, of which there are approximately 2,500. The correspondent says certain of these organisations were reported by the Department of Health to be “technically trading recklessly”. The correspondent offers copies of related reports. I will open the floor to members to see how we might proceed.The correspondence does not give us a sense of which organisation is being talked about or any specific information. I believe that if the correspondent has information then we should request that information from that person because I am certainly interested in seeing it. Deputy Murphy is first because she flagged this item for discussion. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	516	Most of the section 38 and 39 organisations are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General so that responsibility lies with the HSE. The correspondence is very general and I agree with the Chairman that without specifics it is difficult to know the magnitude of what is being talked about and whether it is solid information. Each one of these organisations is audited and the HSE has a responsibility. Therefore, it is important that the committee writes to the HSE seeking assurances about the HSE's internal controls, how an audit proceeds and whether this matter would show up in an audit. We need to get those assurances in the first instance.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	517	We should and the Deputy is correct. I hope that where €5.7 billion goes to 2,500 organisations that the part of the HSE which deals with this requests audited accounts every year before divvying out money for the coming year.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	518	I support the proposal that the committee write to the HSE. The correspondent makes what I would consider to be very serious allegations that we, as a committee, must take seriously. The person states that it was known to the Department of Health that some section 38 and 39 organisations were insolvent. In the first instance, it is important that we get whatever evidence for that is available or learn on what basis that statement can be made. The correspondent went on to say that of greater concern was that some of these organisations were reported, in writing, to be “technically trading recklessly”. If those reports are available then they should be shared with this committee. We can only take things from there on that basis. I agree with Deputy Murphy's proposal that we write to the HSE because the HSE has the ultimate obligation to ensure that when it spends public money that it is done in a way that allows for full accountability, and ensures that the money is not going to an organisation that is insolvent or "trading recklessly". We can deal with the further information when it comes in and perhaps if we get a response from the HSE but there is not much else we can do at this point.

I presume there is a timeframe for accounts to be produced and that one cannot produce them on 31 December. It might be important that we seek clarification on the following. What is the time period, from the end of the financial year, for the accounts to be provided by an auditor? Let us say an auditor signs off accounts. Is there a timeframe or what is it? Does the timeframe vary for different organisations?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	520	That is important and we can request that. The Comptroller and Auditor General audits a small number of section 38 organisations.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	521	That is correct, Chair. It is just five of the section 38s. It is a really a question of how the section 38s evolved. Some of them evolved and were assigned to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. Many of them would have come out of charitable organisations or religious organisations so they would have been voluntary bodies, not part of the part of the public service, and they would traditionally have arranged their own auditors.

The correspondent claims that these issues are not being reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General. If the Comptroller and Auditor General finds something while conducting an audit what does he do?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	523	There is an obligation on any auditor of financial statements to consider the going concern basis upon which the accounts are put together. So every auditor has to consider whether there is any question, or any uncertainty, about the trading basis. Certainly, if there was a question of insolvency, the auditor would be obliged to report that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	524	Do the auditors of the almost 2,500 organisation have an equal obligation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	525	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	529	If it was something that the auditor should have seen, or should have reported, and they did not then their licence to continue as an auditor would be removed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	531	Broadly, yes. The voluntary hospitals would be section 38s.

There are about eight hospices that are section 39 organisations and it is proposed to change them to section 38 organisations. Would the hospices be in a more secure position as section 38 organisations?.

Over the years some organisations have found it difficult to hire auditors due to a lack of availability. I do not know if that is still the case but it certainly was a few years ago. I presume a sample audit is done of the organisations. The likes of the HSE would not be able to conduct an internal audit on all of the 2,500 organisations.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	549	We can ask the HSE that question.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	550	We can ask the HSE how it chooses. Like ourselves, if we see an instance of non-compliance with procurement then that tends to act as a red flag but if there is a clear audit opinion then one tends to be less concerned. One is more concerned about the organisations that do not get a clear audit. It would be useful for us to understand the HSE's strategy and how it deploys its internal audit and whether that is mixed around smaller organisations and some of the bigger ones.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-13 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	551	Just from my knowledge of it, there is a very sizeable internal audit organisation within the HSE. It is very proactive. Many of its reports would be published unless there were very particular sensitivities, say a criminal prosecution maybe arising from some of the findings. Certainly, if matters are brought to the attention of the HSE of a suspected fraud in an organisation then the HSE's own internal audit would go in there. For larger section 38s and section 39s, one would expect them, as a matter of good governance, to have their own internal audit systems to examine any issues where there were concerns or, on a cyclical basis, to look at the controls that are in operation in the organisation and report to the relevant board in that case.

One, we must write to the correspondent with a request that information is provided regarding the allegations being made in terms of the section 38 and 39 organisations and we see what is produced. Second, we must write to the HSE with the questions on auditing in terms of when audit accounts are requested, what period they have and the response.We will also ask it about the percentage of section 38 and 39 organisations that are audited and how that is done.

Moving on to the work programme, we agreed at last week's meeting to proceed with a schedule of engagements up to Christmas. The secretariat is working to make the necessary arrangements. Next week, we will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The following week, we will engage with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Are there other matters that members wish to raise concerning the work programme? They have it in front of them. Do they want to change or flag anything about it? I take it that they are okay with it. That concludes our business.

Like myself and others, I am sure that the Chair will have been surprised to read in this morning's Irish Independent about the latest fiasco in which An Bord Pleanála has found itself. Ironically, delays in strategic housing development, SHD, applications are leading to fines being imposed on An Bord Pleanála. We are told that they are now in the region of €1 million.

In previous engagements, we have spoken about the amount of money that has been lost by An Bord Pleanála in terms of judicial reviews and other legal actions. Now we find that a further €1 million is being expended because of its failure to deal with SHD applications in the way it was obliged to.

The disclosure that 105 payments of €10,000 each have been made to, as I understand it from reading today's newspaper, approximately 84 developers is shameful. It is indicative of the state in which the organisation is. The impact that An Bord Pleanála is having on future development is disgraceful. It is holding back a great deal of development, be it housing or key infrastructure that the State has a critical need for, given our growing population. I am hearing about this from every quarter. In light of Deputy Carthy's comments, it is urgent that An Bord Pleanála appears before us sooner than planned. Is there any space available? If it is possible for us to discuss bringing An Bord Pleanála in at a closer date, it needs to be done quickly. It is becoming clear that the organisation is in total disarray. This situation needs to be dealt with urgently if we as an Oireachtas are serious about wanting to improve it. It needs to be investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts.

In light of the latest revelations, which I learned of from a different news outlet, I suggest that we schedule An Bord Pleanála next in line, which would be the first meeting of the new year.

We will put that on our work programme as our first meeting in January. If that concludes any other business, we will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. next Thursday when we will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Even though we are only a week out from that meeting, if there are specific issues that members wish to raise, they should flag them with the clerk over the next day or two so that he can alert the Department to them.
