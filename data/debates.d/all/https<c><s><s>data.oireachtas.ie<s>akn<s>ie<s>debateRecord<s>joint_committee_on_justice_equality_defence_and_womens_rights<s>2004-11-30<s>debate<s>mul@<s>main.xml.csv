#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his officials to the meeting, the purpose of which is to consider a motion referred by both Houses to this committee. It reads:That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 (No. 29 of 1996) shall continue in operation for the period ending on 31st December 2006.Analogous wording has been used for the Seanad motion. Members have been circulated with a copy of the sixth report by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the operation of sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 covering the period 23 November 2002 to 11 November 2004, inclusive, pursuant to section 11(3) of the Act. Some additional details were received from the Department on amendments to section 8 concerning the number of persons detained under section 2 of the Act. The version circulated is the new section under paragraph 8.I invite the Minister to make a brief presentation on the operation of the Act.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The resolution before the committee seeks approval for the retention of those sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 which relate to the detention of suspected drug traffickers. As members will be aware, section 11 of the Act requires the Minister to prepare a report on the operation of the provisions in question in conjunction with the moving of a resolution to provide for their renewal. The necessary report covering the period 23 November 2002 to 11 November 2004 has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.Our primary focus this afternoon is on the renewal of the detention provisions in the Act and I am pleased to be here to discuss the matter with members of the committee. However, before elaborating on the various sections of the Act at issue, it would be useful to place our discussions in the context of the overall drugs problem and the Government's response to it. My Department's role in drug policy is primarily, although not exclusively, in the area of drug supply control, just one of the elements of the Government's overall holistic approach to tackling the drugs issue.We are all aware of the ongoing challenge which drug misuse, including the very nature of addiction, presents for all societies in the modern world. In recent decades drug misuse has increasingly become an integral part of societal culture in virtually every country in the developed world. Ireland is no exception to this global phenomenon. The Government remains very conscious that drug misuse continues to be one of the most pressing social problems being experienced in our communities today. The harm and misery brought about as a consequence of drug abuse at the level of the individual, family and society demand our ongoing attention and firm resolve to tackle the problem head on. For this reason, addressing drug misuse continues to be a major priority for the Government as reflected in the programme for Government. The Government knows a focused, integrated and co-ordinated approach to this multi-faceted and difficult problem is required. It is precisely for this reason the national drugs strategy has been put in place. As members will be aware, it sets out a policy framework for dealing with the drugs issue for the period 2001-08 and contains 100 individual actions to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. The seven-year strategy is ongoing work. Departments and agencies involved in its implementation have made welcome progress to date in delivering or progressing many of the actions.The strategy is being delivered across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Central to the approach is the bringing together of the work of the key Departments and agencies in a co-ordinated manner, working with the communities most affected by the drug problem. This latter dimension is a key element in our approach. The experience and expertise of people dealing with the issue at ground level within local communities must continue to be recognised and utilised in real ways in a collective effort. The encouraging progress made in recent years via real partnership approaches between the State agencies, the community and the voluntary sector in tackling the drugs problem, through for example the work programme and projects of the local drug task force and the work of the national drug strategy team and the national advisory committee on drugs, all with cross-sectoral representation, must be built upon to ensure significant and real improvements.Over 500 community-based projects have been established in local areas, through which a range of different drug-related responses are in place. The number of heroin abusers seems to have stabilised. The number of places in treatment services has increased considerably, as has the availability of methodone treatment. The Department of Education and Science implemented a drugs misuse prevention programme in all schools in the local drug task force areas during the academic year 2001-02. Guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drug policy have also been developed and were issued to primary and post-primary schools in May 2000. The national advisory committee on drugs continues to implement the very important research mandate given to it by the Government. That mandate has recently been renewed for a further period to coincide with the second half of the national drugs strategy.In terms of resources, it is worthwhile pointing out that approximately €80 million has been allocated to date to assist in the region of 500 projects under the two rounds of the plan of the local drug task force. Approximately €12.8 million has been allocated under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation of community-based drug projects, the majority of which are in the task force areas, and approximately €75 million has been provided for in the region of 450 facilities and services under the young persons' facilities and services fund. That is in addition to the ongoing funding for agencies which deal with drug issues as part of their ordinary business.The Government knows it cannot be complacent in relation to the work it still faces in tackling the drug problem. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating the strategy, announced that a significant increase in funding will be provided for drug programmes next year. Overall a total of €31.5 million is being provided in next year's Estimates for the various drug initiatives under the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. That represents an 18% increase over the 2004 figure. The increased funding will be used to support and resource important new drug initiatives which the task forces will develop as their action plans come on stream next year. The Government is also committed to building on the progress made by the young people's facilities and services fund. I supplied material in my script in relation to that.The second round of funding of more than €13 million which the Government announced for the fund last year will enable a number of new dedicated youth and community centres to be built in such places as Darndale, Knockmitten in Clondalkin, Brookfield in Tallaght, Ballywaltrim in Bray and Knocknaheany in Cork city. Funding will also be made available towards the staffing and operational costs of a number of centres built under the first round of the fund. The 33% increase in funding for the RAPID programme, in addition to the €6 million increase in the community and voluntary local development services funding for 2005 which will fund 15 new development projects in disadvantaged areas, will further assist in tackling the drug problem in the areas where it is most felt. All this is evidence of the Government's continued commitment to addressing the drug problem in a targeted way.My Department's submission to the review indicated that our focus over the next four years of the strategy will be aimed at ensuring that a robust legislative response remains in place to tackle the drug problem, continued policy development in the area of drug arrest referral schemes and the drugs court, the development of community policing fora on a statutory basis in the context of the Garda Síochána Bill which is currently before the Seanad that will build on the success of the drug task force originated fora which already exist, the building of inter-agency collaboration and collaboration with the community and voluntary treatment sectors.I now turn to the question of supply reduction. The proposal to renew detention provision under this Act for a further two years is particularly relevant in that context. Members of the committee will be aware of the concerted action of the law enforcement agencies to tackle the drug problem. The Garda Síochána enforcement response to reducing the supply of drugs centres around a number of key principles, one of which is conducting intelligence driven operations at an international, national and local level against the criminal networks involved in the trade. Such major operations continue to result in many significant drug seizures being made in this country and in the disruption of supply networks. In addition, more locally focused operations targeted at street dealers and dealers operating in licensed premises continue to yield positive results.The ongoing success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in implementing the Government strategy to pursue and recover the proceeds of crime, including assets accrued through drug trafficking, is also to be applauded. Obviously we are very pleased every time there is a successful drugs operation, but we are not naive enough to imagine that the organised drug traffickers would just give up when their assets are seized or their supply is interdicted. As well as ensuring that our law enforcement agencies get the ongoing resources that they need to tackle drug trafficking, it is crucial that our legislative response at all times provides the necessary platform from which our agencies can effectively operate.That brings me to the business of today. Section 11 of the Act provides that each of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will cease to be in operation 12 months after the date of the commencement unless they are extended in the manner provided under the Act. On a number of occasions they have been extended. Resolutions were most recently passed in December 2002 and they bring the life of the sections up to 31 December 2004. It is now proposed to renew them for a further two-year period to 2006. I reiterate my comment on the last occasion I brought this matter before the committee when I said that Members of the Oireachtas get the opportunity to examine at appropriate intervals strong legislative provisions such as these in order to determine the need to retain them. I think the drugs problem is such now that the notion that this is temporary legislation is beginning to diminish. I think it will have to be a permanent aspect of our law. That is not to say that I resent in any way coming in and having to report on it, but I do not think the life of these provisions should depend on continual renewal. We should face up to the fact that the provisions set out in my statement are permanent features of the response to drugs for the foreseeable future. Obviously it is a question of balance as to how these powers are used. The report before the committee shows that they are not used on an indiscriminate basis, but they have to be used in an effective way. While drug supply controls are only one element of the Government's overall drug response, the passing of this resolution allows us to demonstrate that we are determined as a Parliament to deal with drug traffickers and sends the right message to the law enforcement agencies to get on with the task.As Minister, I propose to introduce in the near future prison rules which will introduce mandatory drug testing in prisons. I hope those rules will be ready in the coming weeks. It is very important that when we find people who are both drug addicts and drug suppliers and commit them to prison, they should not be left in an environment where drug availability is condoned or regarded as inevitable. That is in my view a counsel of despair. If we believe in rehabilitation, we have to follow through on the logic of that to stop prisons being places where drugs are easily available to people sent there for punishment and rehabilitation.

Do I take it that the only report we have is here in front of us, this rather brief three pages? It is not really a report. There are a couple of statistics at the end. We were critical of the extent of the report two years ago.There is need for a proper breakdown. The Minister says 1,228 people were detained under section 2 in the two-year period. Does he have any idea of what the offences were? There is no information to show whether the numbers have been declining or increasing since 1996. They are lumped together as one single lot of figures, without any indication of the nature of the offences or the number in each month or year. We need a much more precise statistical breakdown, which would be very valuable. We have no idea what happened to these people, other than that some were convicted. We do not know how many were convicted or subject to the mandatory ten-year sentence for drug possession and trafficking. We would like to know what happened there. The Minister has been critical of judges not imposing that sentence. Only a handful of sentences have been executed in a mandatory fashion. We would appreciate a breakdown of what has been happening in that respect.The figures indicate that the seven day detention was never used in the period, zilch from 120 hours to 168 hours. The vast majority — 580 — were in the first six hours. The second largest number — 489 — was in the six to 24 hours. There were 147 up to 48 hours, two days. The second last category was 12. There were none from 120 hours to 168 hours. Is there any explanation for the extra period if it is not being used? I am not sure if it was used at all. We need information as to the nature of the offences for which the detention periods were short or long. It is important.I have no problem in giving substantial powers to deal with drug trafficking. We have already given it to the Criminal Assets Bureau. We certainly need to deal with this huge issue in Irish society but we also need to get the best information available so that we can detect how things are going. We do not even know the extent to which cocaine has displaced heroin. The Minister states in the report that there seems to be a stabilisation of heroin. If so, the reason is that people have moved to cocaine. There is no reference to that.Similarly there is no reference to the fact that hard drugs are being supplied in country areas. There was no trafficking of drugs out of Dublin until about 1996. A problem now exists nationwide. We saw the figures from the health authorities outside Dublin which showed that in the five-year period up to 2003 there was a trebling of the number of people who presented with drug addiction. That clearly indicates the nature of the problem. You do not present with drug addiction unless you have a problem. Drug networks are being established throughout the country.We saw the "Prime Time" programme last night in which it was categorically stated by very respectable figures in Limerick, elected representatives and the State solicitor, that what was going on there was a cancer in our society, and that it was a combination of drugs and guns. It was said that it was widespread and fast moving towards a stage where they would come together and establish a Mafia-type operation. Drugs are pushing this. It was clearly stated that drugs are the engine of this activity in Limerick and that people are fighting for their drug patches. The guns come in with the drugs. They are part and parcel of the criminal activity that is widespread there. The same thing is true in west Dublin where there was an assassination last week. It is not good enough for the Minister to say it is the dying sting of a wasp. We cannot live in denial. There is a serious problem of hard drug use and abuse throughout the country and it is not being dealt with.The Minister in his introduction spoke about the mid-term review and the national drug strategy. The strategy has been a failure and virtually all the submissions which have been made by people dealing with it, from the local task forces down, have made a similar type of criticism, that the resources were not put in place, assistance was not given, budgets were not put in place, they could not plan, facilities were not there, the RAPID money was withdrawn. They were left in limbo. There has been no national drug strategy for four years. There has been only lip service. As a result, hard drugs have spread throughout the country. There was no policy to target a new hard drug coming on stream. Cocaine is now becoming the drug of choice rather than heroin. That is not being properly tackled.We have a serious problem and we are dealing only with a couple of aspects. This is the crime prevention aspect, the detection, detention and sentencing. We need a lot more information about what is happening, the changing character of drug use and misuse, not the bare statistical detail without a useful breakdown. It is not much use to say that mandatory drug testing will be introduced in prisons sometime in the future. The Minister is in an ongoing row with the governor of Mountjoy on that issue. The prison will explode because drugs are widely available in Mountjoy. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has ever been prosecuted or convicted for use or possession of drugs in that prison, although there have been seizures of drugs there. People are put into the prison because they are in possession of drugs, perhaps given a mandatory ten-year sentence, but drugs are widely used in the prison. Nothing is ever done about it. If there is mandatory drug testing, the majority of prisoners will fail the test. What does the Minister propose to do with them? He has not thought out anything in relation to these policies.There is no coherent approach to dealing with criminality. There is no point in the Minister saying on radio or television that there is such an approach when it is not the reality. We who are on the ground know this. I know the level of drug pushing outside my office in Seán McDermott Street, in Sheriff Street, and the level of frustration among the community in the area that the problem has reached a level which did not exist a number of years ago. It was terrible in the 1980s and part of the 1990s and then it came almost to an end. Now it is getting out of hand again and it is being done with relative impunity. We want more than a nice words; we want a decent report. We want to be of assistance to the Minister on the issue because the last thing any of us wants to see is drug trafficking in our communities because of the damage it causes and the fact that people's lives are ruined by it. I will not oppose the continuation of the powers outlined but to give the Minister a mandate to continue them, we need a much fuller report rather than the bare statistical information before us.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	My party will not oppose any provision that would assist the law enforcement agencies in tackling the drug trafficking problem but, as Deputy Costello said, we are not winning the war. At this stage we are not even winning the battle because drugs are freely available in communities countrywide, not just in Dublin. While we will support whatever provisions are necessary, we need more resources for the agencies tackling the drugs problem which is causing great hardship and destroying communities. Community spirit is gone. As a consequence, people are fearful in their own communities as a result of drug trafficking and abuse.I am not sure these provisions are sufficient. The Minister has said they are in place on a temporary basis but, in fact, they are permanent. Will he bring forward further legislation or permanent laws to tackle drug trafficking? Will he put more resources into communities? He said in his report that he had allocated more resources for drug abuse prevention measures. The €60 million seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau from drug traffickers and criminals should be used to provide additional funding for those communities which have suffered from drug trafficking.I do not know what the position is on mandatory sentences. What can we do to ensure there are more mandatory sentences and that judges enforce the laws already in place? We can only make laws. I do not know how we can make the Judiciary enforce them. While the Minister will have our support in retaining these provisions, more action must be taken and more resources must be made available because the drugs problem affects the entire country and destroys communities.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Like Deputy Costello, I find the information contained in the report is minimal. The statistics have not been worked out and it is not clear why we should extend the legislation for a further two years. Even with the laws in place prior to this legislation, 87% of those referred to in the report — the 1,228 people arrested and held — could have been held and questioned for 24 hours. By extending the period allowed, a further 12% could have been so held. It is clear from the figures, therefore, that only 12 people were covered by the new extended holding period allowed for in the legislation, while nobody qualified to be held for a period of 120 to 168 hours.We are not told holding certain people for more than 48 hours resulted in additional gain. Did holding them for that period lead to certain charges or were they already subject to those charges when arrested? Did holding them lead to conviction or drug seizures? Figures are presented without explanation. With regard to those convicted, the report does not state how many were charged with possessing small or large amounts of drugs, or what they were charged with. They could have been charged with entirely different offences. The same holds for those whose cases are pending.It would be good to have such information because at the end of the report the Minister says these regulations made a substantial contribution to the fight against drugs. If they did, they are to be welcomed but the information before us does not offer proof of the supposed contribution. All it proves is quite a number have been arrested. It does not indicate of what they were convicted. The Minister might provide more specific details, although not necessarily on a case by case basis.I do not have my notes on the previous discussion on the issue but as far as I recall, section 4 had not been used in the period under discussion. We are now four years into the operation of the legislation. If the section is not being used because this is emergency or temporary legislation, it should be allowed to lapse. If the Minister intends to make it permanent, we need to see the necessary legislation as soon as possible in order that we can discuss it with the issue raised by other Deputies, namely, that we are not winning the fight against drugs.The geographical spread is increasing and despite what the Minister said, he has not faced up to the scale of the drugs problem. Deputy Costello is correct in saying the scale of the heroin problem may have been stabilised but as a society, we have not faced up to the cocaine problem. We need to tackle this scourge head on before it reaches the scale of the heroin problem before we tackled it.Those are my main concerns, although I will not oppose the motion. However, the report on the legislation has arrived so late that we are at the wire. If the motion is not passed by tomorrow, the Government will be in breach of its own regulations. We all knew it was coming. I made the point two years ago that we needed to deal with this issue as quickly as possible when the report was published rather than wait until the last minute when we would face time constraints.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Like other speakers, I welcome the extension of these powers. The question is whether they are sufficient to counter what is a serious drugs problem. I, too, saw the relevant programme on television last night. Other programmes have also considered the associated problems, as have newspaper articles. I am sure we all share the Minister's concerns about crime, much of which is drugs related. It is not a new or an Irish phenomenon but an international issue. In this regard, I wonder if there could be a stronger EU focus and initiative as we have been dealing with the issue for at least three or four decades. The problem is increasing all over the world. Quite violent criminals are becoming involved in that scene. A friend of mine makes the argument that there was much criminal activity in the US during the prohibition period until alcohol was legalised again. I am not sure if that is the answer in the case of drugs, but my friend would argue strenuously that it is. While I dismissed his argument, I believe we need to look at the matter in a more open-minded way than in the past. Policing is not containing the issue.In July I was in Shanghai and met a person from Carlow who had been living there for a number of years. He left Shanghai about three years ago but had to go back because he had a strong attachment to the quality of life and security there. There is no tolerance of serious crime there and capital punishment is used. Nobody here would advocate that, but we should recognise that the degree of civil liberties built into the current legislation in the criminal area should perhaps be reviewed. Nobody wants a police state, with abuses on the other side. On the other hand, we cannot countenance a continuation of the growth in violent crime on our streets and across Europe and elsewhere. We must achieve a position between the extremes.We see on television programmes criminals involved in murder and violent crime who are known to the Garda and the community, yet they are free to walk the streets. It raises the question of what needs to be done in rebalancing where we stand. I hope the people around this table will be supportive of the Minister in any initiative he takes. In other fora I have heard people argue that legislation is oppressive and takes away civil liberties. Many reasonable people would sacrifice some civil liberties to live in a safer environment.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I am a firm believer that the effectiveness of the Garda is largely reliant on the intelligence available from the local community. We should not underestimate the knowledge of people in the community who recognise the movement of people who are involved in drug trafficking. There is clearly a difficulty for people with that knowledge. Many of them are young people who are terrified of reporting because of what may happen if it becomes known that they went to the Garda. I have previously raised the possibility of advertising in public media to encourage people to assist the Garda by reporting that kind of information. The Garda can only be as effective as the people who assist them. That means all of us within our own communities.We are renewing the provisions in the legislation before us but we have not mentioned alcohol. I do not wish to take from the seriousness of what we have been discussing, but we know there is illegal trafficking of alcohol from off-licences by irresponsible adults or licence-holders to young people who are under age. This is another example of drug trafficking which is not addressed in this legislation. Nevertheless it is very serious. Alcohol is still the most widely abused drug. Where other drugs are used, alcohol is never too far away. Lethal concoctions are made when people are involved in both.Greater powers should be given to the Garda. We support the Minister in this provision but I believe we will be back sooner rather than later to consider giving powers to the Garda in other areas. Many gardaí are doing a great job, even with limited resources, and often they do not get credit. I hope that with the deployment of the extra 2,000 gardaí the small towns and villages where drug trafficking is going on at a steady pace, as well as the cities, will be looked after.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	A number of points have been made. We are here to consider whether these powers should be extended. That is the net issue. The statute requires that before I move that the powers should be extended I should account for how they have been used. I am not required to set before the House a White Paper on drug abuse, but simply a report of whether these powers are or are not being abused or used at all. It is very clear from the figures set out in the report I have tabled that the powers are not being used excessively and that nobody could claim that.Reference was made to section 4, which contains a prohibition on re-arrest of people, except where a warrant is issued by a judge for re-arrest and questioning under the terms of the Act. It is not a matter of section 4 being redundant if it is not used. It is a civil liberty section providing that people cannot be repeatedly arrested and questioned and detained under the Act without judicial intervention. The number of times it may have been used is not in any sense a measure of the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of section 4. The purpose is to prevent repeated detention of people for lengthy periods unless there is judicial intervention in aid of arresting members of the Garda Síochána.Research was conducted by the national advisory committee on drugs in 2003 which found that there were 14,500 opiate users in Ireland, of whom 12,300 resided in the Dublin area and 2,200 outside that area. The great majority of the 2,200 are in what is now the greater Dublin area — Wicklow, Kildare and adjoining counties. This was based on statistics provided by three data sources, the central drug treatment list, the national Garda study on drugs and crime and related criminal activities, and the hospital inpatient inquiry database. That was the best estimate of the national advisory committee. The number of drug users they found in Dublin had decreased marginally since a previous comparable study in 1996. That was a drop of approximately 1,000. That looked at the situation in Dublin only. In areas outside the ERHA there was a fourfold increase not in the numbers of abusers but in the number of people receiving treatment in the period 1998-2002. There are now 7,100 people on methodone, which compares with 5,000 receiving such treatment at the end of 2,000. In the context of the overall number of heroin users, we have a high methodone treatment rate by European standards.I wish to give the committee some figures relating to cocaine. I share the views of the committee that this is a worrying area and we discussed it at Government today. Figures from the general population drug survey which were conducted by the NDAC in 2003 showed that 3.1% of the population have at some time used cocaine, a very high figure, that 1.1% used it in the previous 12 months and that three in a thousand people had used it in the past month. Lifetime prevalence was highest among 15 to 24 years olds. Compared with other similar comprehensive surveys conducted in European countries, cocaine use in Ireland is average and, therefore, we have nothing to be happy about in this regard. While the numbers presenting for treatment for cocaine use remain low and they represent a small percentage of the number in drug treatment, the Government has become aware of an increase in the use of the drug. Blood samples analysed by the medical bureau of road safety show an alarming presence of cocaine. This coincides with a general increase in availability and use of cocaine in Europe generally as a result of increased production, particularly in Colombia, which has resulted in a consequential drop in the street price. The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs recently approved additional funding of €400,000 to support a series of pilot projects targeted at cocaine abuse.Deputy Ó Snodaigh will not be pleased with my comments. His party sent a group of people to interact with FARC, a communist terrorist organisation in Colombia, which funds its entire campaign by exporting cocaine from the regions it controls. I hope in future they will be more careful about whom they talk to because the cocaine problem in Ireland is driven largely by two groups in Colombia — the right wing death squads and the cartels they operate and the Marxist FARC group, which meets its needs by exporting cocaine to the rest of the world.The Garda authorities reported that in the period since the introduction of this provision a total of 229 persons have been prosecuted, of whom 22 received a sentence of more than ten years. When this issue was debated recently, I noticed a change in the pattern of sentencing among the Judiciary. It is important that all political parties send a message to the Judiciary that they are supportive of the minimum sentence. I was interrogated about this on television recently as if it were wrong to have it in place and it was counterproductive. The great majority of people support the minimum mandatory sentence. The Judiciary is frequently urged by barristers defending their clients to the best of their ability that their clients are small cogs in a big machine. They are a small and deliberate cog in almost every case in a machine of death. It is about as realistic to refer to small cogs in a machine in the context of the holocaust as to refer to small cogs in a machine in the distribution of drugs in Ireland. People who deal in drugs deal in death because they make death the inevitable consequence for many addicts. They also use killing to enforce their patches and to collect their debts. There is a strong correlation between the use of firearms and killing in the drugs business.The Garda has broken up many activities of criminal gangs in Dublin. Some of the more recent events that have been witnessed are consequences of the break up and collapse of the gangs and the seizure of their arsenals. Let us not fool ourselves. I agree with Deputy Costello and other members that a serious effort is being made by a number of criminals to dominate the drugs business and they will stop at nothing to enforce their dominance. The Garda is taking the matter seriously. The Criminal Assets Bureau is doing its bit to confiscate the assets of drug dealers but the majority of assets recovered are connected to tax evasion, smuggling and so on, and not to drugs.I acknowledge the comments about the spread of drugs beyond Dublin and that soft drugs are available in most provincial towns and villages, which is a serious development. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to come to the Department to explain the strategic thinking and activities of the force in regard to the supply of drugs. If we are serious about this problem, we must be strategic in our response to it. The Garda, using modern management techniques, is addressing the issue in a way that is more strategic than reactive because that is the only way to crack this problem.I refer to the prisons issue. I do not have rows with governors. I am implementing the Government's policy, which is that prisons should be drugs free. Anybody who cannot live with that policy has a simple choice. There is no question of tolerating drugs in prisons and I intend to ensure mandatory testing of prisoners for drugs is introduced because that is part of the programme for Government. I also intend to ensure all the steps that are being taken to minimise the supply of drugs in prisons such as nets over exercise yards in urban locations and so on are intensified and screened visits become the order of the day. A number of prisons are relatively drug free but if a prison is a harbour of considerable drug abuse, it is failing in its role in society because criminal offences are being committed in the prison, the system is corrupted, prisoners' lives are at risk both in terms of health and the dangers posed to other prisoners, there is no rehabilitation for prisoners who take intravenous drugs and when they are released they will have accumulated debt to others and developed a florid habit of drug abuse, which can be satisfied only through continued criminal activity or prostitution.It is a duty of Government to make our prisons drug free and those who seek sterilising fluid and needle exchanges in prisons are arguing for the abdication of a primary duty of government.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I thank the committee for inviting us to discuss the Bill and the concerns of insurers. We made a written submission to the committee some time ago to which I will refer. The purpose of the submission was to give a context to our concerns about the Bill. The IIF represents life assurance companies operating in Ireland. Our members write the vast majority of life assurance business.Part 4 of the Bill concerns us most. It deals with access by insurers to genetic test results and the medical history information of families. In describing our concerns we need to put the provisions in context and explain how life assurance works. Members will be familiar with the general principles. Insurance is about the pooling of risks. All insured persons contribute to the pool which enables us to keep the cost affordable. One of the principles of pooling is that people who have below average health and, therefore, a higher chance of claiming from the pool pay more for their insurance. One of the basic principles of insurance is that everyone pays his or her fair share and, therefore, some pay more than others.The submission outlines the main types of cover because there is a difference in the impact of the legislative proposals depending on the level of cover. Life cover policies pay an amount on death and critical or serious illness policies pay out if someone is diagnosed with an illness covered by the policy. Long-term disability insurance policies which provide an income if people are unable to work are also available. These types of cover will be affected by the legislation.When somebody applies for insurance, he or she goes through a process to determine whether he or she should pay the average premium because he or she is an average risk or pay an above average premium because he or she is an above average risk. The submission outlines the procedures people go through. They fill in an application form in respect of which the insurer may ask them to take a medical and seek a report from their GP. The intention is to get a picture of the individual's state of health and then, by using statistics relating to people who have a similar condition, to determine what premium he or she should pay. Insurance companies try to examine every case on an individual basis. There is not a standard industry practice. It is competitive and practices will vary.We estimate 95% of people get life cover at the average premium, 4% at a higher than average premium while 1% are declined. Therefore, the vast majority who seek life assurance from insurance companies get cover at the average premium. The right of insurers to treat categories of people differently is enshrined in the Equal Status Act. Insurers can treat people differently if they rely on reliable actuarial and statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors.Underwriting is only done when the person takes out the policy. People may seek a policy that will last 20 or 30 years. The only relevant issue is their state of health when they apply for insurance. If their health changes subsequently, the insurance company cannot revise the contract. It is a long-term business and we must take a long-term view because we are often tied into premium rates which are set on day one. Insurance contracts have particular features. There is a legal obligation on those who apply for insurance to be up front about their health and disclose everything to the insurance company that may impact on their health.Concerns have been expressed about genetic information to which insurance companies have responded. We introduced a voluntary code of practice in 2001 which provides that somebody seeking life assurance in conjunction with a mortgage, for example, can obtain cover up to €381,000 without having to disclose test results. Given that the average housing loan is approximately €170,000, most people can get a reasonable amount of cover without having to worry about the disclosure of test results. This was done in response to the concerns of many about genetic information.I refer to the provisions of the Bill. Our main concern is that somebody applying for insurance may know more than the insurance company when he or she applies. If he or she knows something that is not required to be disclosed, he or she may seek more cover than he or she would otherwise obtain or seek cover where he or she otherwise would not seek it. He or she would be charged a lower premium than he or she would be entitled to, in theory, based on his or her state of health.Section 40 proposes a ban on access to genetic test results. We have a voluntary code that goes some way towards this. Therefore, we do not necessarily have a concern about the ban limiting access but we are concerned that insurance companies need to be protected regarding large amounts of cover, as provided for under the voluntary code. Similarly, section 41 proposes restrictions on access to information on family history. Such restrictions may impact on our ability to write certain forms of cover, in particular, critical illness insurance.The Bill's provisions should be open to review much sooner than 2014. This a rapidly changing scientific field and we want it kept under regular review to assess what is its impact in the marketplace. We also have concerns about the definition of "genetic testing" which goes further than predictive tests and may, unintentionally, stray into other areas. We have made suggestions to the Department in this regard.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I welcome the delegation. Most of us were taken aback when the IIF sought a hearing before the committee because we did not understand it had concerns. How many people qualified for long-term illness benefit under an insurance policy in the past four years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Many people have taken out this cover. Successful claims under these policies amounted to approximately €30 million in 2003.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Restrictions on this cover have become so severe that it is virtually impossible to take out a policy. One would have to lose half one's faculties before making a successful claim. I am not certain why insurers are nervous in this regard, given the restrictions in place.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	34	There are two types of cover. Critical illness policies will generally pay out a lump sum. Therefore, it is a once-off payment. The long-term illness policy relates to permanent health insurance. As the claims experience of insurers in this area has been negative, everybody may not obtain such insurance. If people have jobs with a strong manual element or if they have a history of a condition that may keep them out of work, they may have difficulty obtaining cover. Critical illness cover is not as restrictive and few would fail to get it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Typically less than 1% cannot get life assurance while less than 5% cannot get permanent health insurance. It is similar for critical illness cover. I am unclear about the question. Is the Deputy asking about access to cover or about claims?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Access to cover is as liberal as ever but the payment of claims has become restrictive. If one reads the small print, when one thinks one may have a claim on a policy, one finds it impossible to make the claim. I do not speak from personal experience but I am aware of a number of people who had difficulties in this regard in recent years.I refer to genetic testing. Insurance is a no risk industry. It is supposed to cover me for any risk I take but insurance companies ensure there is no risk. The assessment of risk is so refined that there is virtually no risk to the insurer. I worry about insurance companies having access to genetic test results or being permitted to insist on people taking a genetic test. For example, a person whose family has a history of cystic fibrosis may not want to know whether he or she is carrying the gene. However, granting insurance companies access to genetic test results ensures the limited risk run by them will be limited even further. If they had access, would they consider women over 40 years who became pregnant to be too much of a risk to take on? They could have children who suffer from Down's syndrome. Would insurance companies insist they take a genetic test to establish whether they were a risk? Generally people do not take out massive amounts of cover. They take out enough to cover their outstanding liabilities.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	37	There is no question of insurance companies asking people to take genetic tests. The issue is whether somebody who may have had a genetic test result is required to disclose it to an insurance company. We have no intention, irrespective of what is contained in the legislation, of sending people for genetic tests. Tests are taken by people on their own initiative. If somebody takes out insurance and subsequently has a genetic test, that will not have an impact. I am not sure if that directly answers the question but I hope it addresses some of the concerns.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Yes.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I welcome the Irish Insurance Federation to the committee and thank them for their submission. This is very important legislation. Your submission refers to concerns about Part 4 of the Disability Bill which states that access to genetic test results and family medical history information raises significant issues for life assurance companies. Can you give me an example of the types of issues?My second question relates to dealing with the provisions of the Disability Bill. The submission states that the concerns of the insurers in relation to the Bill stem from the potential for ante-selection and that this raises the possibility of higher than anticipated claims and significantly increased costs for all policy holders. Perhaps you could develop this point, particularly the costs for all policy holders.It is also stated that technical amendments are required to the definition of genetic testing to ensure that only predictive tests are covered. Do you intend to submit amendments and can you give me an example? Is it fair to say that some of your views as expressed in your submission could be interpreted as an infringement on civil liberties or the right to privacy? Is that an accurate view or is it an exaggeration?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	40	An example of some of the concerns we would have is where somebody has had a genetic test for a condition and it is positive. They therefore know the chances are that they may have a shorter than average life expectancy. They are not required to disclose it when they apply for insurance and, because of the way the legislation operates, that person would be treated as though they did not have a lower than average life expectancy. That would mean that they would be charged an unduly favourable premium and effectively would mean that they were subsidised by other policy holders who were paying the correct premium. It is that kind of inequality that arises.A person who knows something about his or her health which they are not required to disclose may look for insurance cover which they might not otherwise have been concerned about or take out more cover than they normally would. That latter tendency is what we call ante-selection. If that happens across a population, the impact can be significant. It is not necessarily easy to quantify.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Our experience would be that people do not always tell us the health information that they should tell us.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Would you know from your experience if it would be 10% or 20%?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	44	It varies. At a younger age it is a lower percentage because typically people have fewer health conditions which would require to be disclosed. It can be in the low single digit percentages, perhaps 3% or 4%. When a person is over the age of 50 when typically there will be more medical history, it could be as many as one in ten people who would not tell us about something that would be a factor.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Over 51, about 10%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It can be significant. The argument very often put forward about why insurance companies should not have access to test results is that people who are considering taking a genetic test should not be put off by the possible insurance consequences. I am sure that argument has been made already in the context of this Bill. The definition of genetic testing as we understand it goes further than just predictive tests. Where someone has not symptoms yet, a predictive test will identify the chances of their developing a condition at some point in the future. The current definition in the Bill would appear to include tests where people actually show symptoms of a condition. When somebody already has the condition, the argument does not stand that he or she will be put off having the test because they do not know whether or not they will develop the condition. There is a distinction between predictive and diagnostic.The final question related to privacy. As an industry we need health information about people in order to assess the risk. If we do not get the information, we cannot assess the risk. Depending on the type of cover, we will have to ask very detailed questions about an individual's health, including their family history. Insurers will not ask for information unless they feel it is necessary to the assessment of the risk and they will also have in place within the companies confidentiality rules to ensure that this information is treated with the respect it deserves. We are conscious of the fact that we are privileged that people give us this information, which is necessary in terms of what we do. We take our responsibilities seriously.

You are both very welcome. Last week the committee heard the views of the Human Rights Commission and today we are most interested to hear the presentation by your organisation. You are both aware that you do not enjoy privilege in respect of any remarks you make.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee on the Disability Bill and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill. We have circulated notes which I will not go through but simply raise the core issues.There is a considerable overlap between the Disability Bill and the equality legislation. Our starting point is that our functions to promote equality of opportunity and to eliminate discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and services extends to some of the areas covered by the Disability Bill. That is particularly relevant in terms of access to and use of public services for people with disabilities and employment of people with disabilities in the public sector.The submission has been circulated to members of the committee. We sought to establish what impact the Bills might have on the operation of the equality legislation and, in particular, whether they build on and add to the provisions already made in the equality legislation, whether they diminish or reduce the existing provisions, or whether they cause confusion as to what precisely the responsibility of public bodies is in providing access to and employing people with disabilities.A number of key provisions in the equality legislation are relevant to this discussion and we have set them out in the notes. They relate to the prohibition on discrimination by public service providers, provisions concerning indirect discrimination by public service providers, the positive duty on public service providers as regards the reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities in the provision of goods and services, and reasonable accommodation in the employment of people with disabilities.The Acts also include provisions regarding positive action in the areas of service provision and employment. Both Acts include a very broad definition of disability, which includes people with physical, intellectual, learning, cognitive or emotional disabilities, and a range of medical conditions. The provisions of the equality legislation are also enforceable through the Equality Tribunal. It is important to note that the Equal Status Acts exempt the taking of any action that will be required under the Disability Bill and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill.In looking at the Disability Bill 2004 from the perspective of the equality legislation, a starting point would be to welcome the idea of new administrative systems that form part of the disability strategy, such as sectoral plans, multi-annual investment programmes, needs assessment and advocacy services. The development of such systems is the key to a service provision that responds better to the needs of people with disabilities.The two Bills that have been published as part of this disability strategy should underpin and guarantee these new administrative systems. However, our analysis suggests that this is not the case, given the issues of scope that arise and given the tensions that are evident between the new legislation and existing equality legislation.In effect the new administrative systems would be better guaranteed and underpinned had the legislation imposed a positive duty on all public bodies to promote equality. That has been the approach in other jurisdictions, particularly in Northern Ireland and Britain. In Northern Ireland there is a duty on specified public authorities to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in carrying out their functions. That involves a range of named grounds, including the disability ground. These public authorities are required to prepare equality schemes and to conduct equality impact assessments in accordance with guidelines established by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Such an approach here would have the added benefit of covering the whole public sector, rather than just the six Departments named in the disability strategy which have to produce sectoral plans.The issues of scope relate to the definition in the Bills of people with disabilities, in addition to the way in which resource issues are addressed in the Bills and to the way the need for advocacy services is assessed.The issues we are raising suggest that the Bills do not add to or build upon the existing provisions. In the first instance, the definition of people with disabilities in the Bills marks a move away from the inclusive and non-hierarchical definition used in the equality legislation. The provisions of the Bills will apply to a far smaller group of people with disabilities. The narrow definition used in the Bills will create a hierarchy of people with disabilities, which is not allowed under equality legislation. Under the equality legislation the majority of people with disabilities have enforceable rights concerning employment and access to services, subject to exemptions. In contrast, the provisions of the new Bills as regards public sector employment and access to public sector buildings and services apply to a far smaller group of people with disabilities and are not enforceable. Our recommendation is that a more inclusive definition of people with disabilities should be used.Section 5 of the Disability Bill would appear to impose a serious restriction on the allocation of resources to the services envisaged by the Bill. At best, it would appear to limit services envisaged by the Bill to a residual situation where funding is made available only after all other responsibilities are met. At worst, it would appear there is no obligation to allocate resources to these services. Our recommendation is that section 5 should ring-fence the resources necessary for the implementation of the Disability Bill and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill.The third scope issue relates to the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill where the entitlement to a personal advocate depends on a range of matters, including the director's opinion that there is a risk of harm to the applicant's health, welfare or safety if they are not provided with social services. That represents a significant limitation on access to advocacy services and our recommendation is that it should be deleted. We have also suggested the need for a broader definition of advocacy services to include community advocacy and community visitor programmes.The final area of focus is the issue of tensions with the equality legislation. The core tension is the move away from the inclusive, non-hierarchical, rights-based model that exists in equality legislation. There are particular issues relating to resources, reasonable accommodation and enforcement. These issues suggest that the Bills could reduce and diminish existing provisions and be a source of confusion for the public sector.The provisions of the Equal Status Acts are subordinate to the taking of an action required by another statute. As such, any action required by the Disability Bill will be used as a defence to any claim under the Equal Status Acts. Public service providers are obliged not to discriminate, directly or indirectly, on the disability ground. They are obliged to provide reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities, unless it costs more than a nominal sum. These obligations may, inevitably, require the allocation of resources. Section 5 of the Bill means that public service providers will be able to argue that they are obliged in certain circumstances not to allocate resources to services envisaged by the Bill.Section 5, therefore, may provide a defence to claims of discrimination, particularly in determining what is justifiable as regards indirect discrimination, and regarding reasonable accommodation. The Bill should state that nothing in the Bill diminishes, in any way, legal obligations with respect to people with disabilities that are imposed under the equality legislation.Regarding reasonable accommodation, the provisions in the Disability Bill on access to buildings and services would appear to fall short of those which are already provided for under equality legislation. They apply to a far smaller group of people and they are dependent on resources having been allocated pursuant to section 5. Buildings must only be accessible "as far as practicable" by 2015. The provisions for services are limited to ensuring that access is integrated. These provisions would appear to fall short of requirements under the Equal Status Acts concerning reasonable accommodation. We recommend that a more effective approach would be to make reasonable accommodation for public service users with disabilities, subject to a disproportionate burden on the service provider. That would be an advance on the current exemption where it is subject to a nominal cost on the service provider. In this way the Disability Bill would enhance and build on the equality legislation and would reflect developments that have already taken place on the employment of people with disabilities under the Employment Equality Acts.As regards the reasonable accommodation provisions, it is important to note that jurisprudence of the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court suggests that making reasonable accommodation requires an assessment of need of the person with disabilities. As such, the assessment of need provided for under the Disability Bill should be broad enough to constitute an assessment of the full spectrum of needs for the purposes of making reasonable accommodation with regard to all services provided by health boards and other public bodies and regarding education. This should happen alongside the assessment of their need for disability-specific services.The compliance mechanisms surrounding the provisions in the Bills are bureaucratic, complex and resource-intensive. They fail to build on the model of enforceable and accessible low-cost remedies through the Equality Tribunal under equality legislation. Our recommendation is that the compliance mechanism should make use of the existing equality infrastructure.Our view is that the Bills introduce valuable new administrative systems but fail to build on and add to the provisions of the equality legislation, and they could actually diminish and reduce existing provisions. They will be a source of confusion in the public sector regarding obligations concerning people with disabilities.We have made a number of recommendations for change, which are set out in more detail in our submission that has been circulated to members of the committee. I have flagged a number of the key ones as I have gone through these speaking notes. I would flag, in particular, the importance of the recommendation where we seek to draw from the experience of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act 2004, to ensure that existing equality legislation and the protection it affords are not diminished in any way under the new Bills.Part 1, section 3 of that Canadian Act provides, "Nothing in this Act, or in the regulations, diminishes in any way the legal obligations of the Government of Ontario or of any person or organisation with respect to persons with disabilities that are imposed under any Act or otherwise imposed by law." An amendment to that effect would protect the equality legislation and the existing provisions therein.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I thank Mr. Crowley for his interesting presentation. Does he think the Equality Act should have been amended with particular reference to disabilities rather than bring forward a Disability Bill?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Significant advances would have been made by amendments to the equality legislation, in particular, by the introduction of a positive duty to promote equality which would have covered and ensured many of the administrative systems suggested in the disability strategy. The reasonable accommodation provisions are very powerful and could easily have been further developed, particularly in the area of service provision. That would have marked a significant step forward for people with disabilities.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Does Mr. Crowley think this undermines the equality legislation which has been so carefully built up in recent years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	55	As it stands, there are contradictions, particularly in regard to the availability of resources and the fact that section 5 of the Disability Bill could be used as a defence in claims made under equality legislation. It would, in effect, therefore, diminish current provisions. That is why we would have focussed on the way the issue was resolved in Ontario by way of specific provisions to ensure existing legislation could not be undermined by this new Bill.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I am sure there is no intention to diminish the legislation in place in any way.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Although Mr. Crowley's submission was short, it contained much. I thank him for being brief and to the point. I will probably need to study it in detail because he said a lot in a short period.Was the Equality Authority consulted in drafting the Disability Bill? Mr. Crowley was critical of the definition contained in the Bill. Does he have an alternative, or does he think the definitions contained in the other Acts would suffice?The Chairman has asked whether this Bill marks a regression on equality legislation. Mr. Crowley's answer seems to suggest that if it is brought forward, that could be the case. Could it be amended to make it acceptable or bring it up to the standard the Equality Authority would like?The Bill is quite complex. Section 5 is very difficult to understand. Some barristers have told me they find it difficult to follow, not to mention lay people. Given that parents and others must read this Bill, I cannot understand why those who drafted it could not have written it in language which would be easier to understand. If barristers find it difficult to understand, how can the ordinary citizen whom we purport to serve understand it? I challenge anybody to read the section to see if they can make sense of it because it is gobbledegook. However, that is another issue.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Is that a question?
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It is.Mr. Crowley has said it appears that under section 5 there is no obligation to allocate resources to the services in question. Am I right that the section could be interpreted as suggesting that when all the other obligations of the health boards have been met what is left over can go to people with disabilities? That would be fine if there were huge funds over an indefinite period. We hope to see multi-annual funding programmes and a large tranche of funding in tomorrow's budget. After the five years have elapsed——
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	60	It is a rolling multi-annual funding programme.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	61	"Rolling" is a new word.Mr. Crowley has said the provisions of the Equal Status Act are subordinate to the taking of an action required by another statute. This seems to indicate the Disability Bill will take precedence over the Equal Status Act. Therefore, instead of having an enhanced service, people with disabilities could end up in a worse position. Is that what Mr. Crowley is saying?It has been argued by others that there is no right to an assessment as such in the Bill, that it could be argued it depends on the availability of resources. In other words, if somebody looks for an assessment and the health board or authority has no money left, it could use this as a defence not to provide for an assessment. If people cannot have an assessment made, they have no hope of accessing services.Mr. Crowley has reinforced my worries about the Bill. He maintains that some of its provisions could cost a lot in terms of bureaucracy. If that is the case, resources could end up being spent on bureaucracy rather than on services. He used two terms, "equality of opportunity" and "equality". I am aware there is a difference between the two. Perhaps he might explain the difference because it has come up as an issue in the debate. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform keeps talking about equality of opportunity, in other words, equality. I would be interested in hearing Mr. Crowley's views on the matter.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I welcome Mr. Crowley and Ms Barry and commend the Equality Authority on its excellent work, particularly on the issues of equality and discrimination. It is particularly relevant that it has come before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights because at times it undertakes many difficult jobs and takes unpopular stances in dealing with discrimination. I commend and thank it for its work which I know at times can be very difficult. There are people who can be hostile towards it.Mr. Crowley has said the definition of "people with disabilities" moves away from the inclusive definition used in equality legislation. Does he see this as a major flaw in the Bill? Section 5 appears to impose a serious restriction on the allocation of resources. Mr. Crowley has said that, at worst, it appears there is no obligation to allocate resources to disability services. From his experience in working with people with disabilities, is the issue of resources and finance for services always a major one when people with disabilities seek to assert their rights as citizens?Mr. Crowley spoke about the tensions between the Bill and equality legislation. On access to buildings and services, he has said it appears to fall short of what is provided under equality legislation. It is up to us, as legislators, to get it right. From his experience in dealing with people with disabilities, could planners, builders and society at large be more creative in resolving these issues?I refer to employment, particularly in the public sector. Public sector employers must take appropriate measures to provide access to employment, training and so on. There is a 3% quota and examples of good practice. I believe Dublin City Council has exceeded the quota and that people with disabilities make up 4.3% of its staff. Are there examples of good practice in the wider community which public and private bodies could follow? What are Mr. Crowley's experiences in this regard in recent years?
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I also welcome Mr. Crowley and Ms Barry to the hearings this afternoon. My question relates to the definition of "disability". Mr. Crowley said he envisaged the services being available to a far smaller group of people with disabilities should the proposed definition be used eventually. Can he tell me more about the larger group who would not benefit if the proposed definition was used? Can he give practical examples?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I thank members of the committee for their welcome and kind words.The issue of the definition has been raised by everyone. It is a major issue. The proposed definition is far narrower than the one used in equality legislation and very restrictive in terms of the benefits that could flow from the Bill to people with disabilities. We have not brought forward an alternative. The definition we use is the one we would prefer but we need to discuss how the issue should be approached. The proposed definition could be used to exclude whole groups of people with disabilities who should have their needs assessed and need access to public sector buildings and services. We need to focus on this issue. While we would prefer to see a common definition — our own — used throughout equality legislation, it is clear the proposed definition would be hugely restrictive.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Will Mr. Crowley give examples of where people with disabilities will not be covered?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	66	They could include people with mild learning difficulties. There are two elements to the definition. There is a substantial restriction of the capacity of a person to carry on a profession, business or occupation, or to participate in the social or cultural life of the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment. The definition is further elaborated on in Part 2 where "substantial" is construed as meaning a restriction which is permanent or likely to be permanent which results in significant difficulty in communication, learning or mobility and gives rise to a need for services to be provided to the person continually. Immediately people with a mild learning disability would be focused on. Depending on how the definitioin is interpreted in terms of significant difficulty in communication, learning or mobility, people with a visual impairment and mental health issues, currently covered by the legislation, could fall into this category.On whether the Bill represents a regression from equality legislation, this is the possibility we are bringing forward. We have raised a number of issues in this regard in terms of how resources are dealt with and how the Bill could be used as a defence in dealing with claims under equality legislation, how the issue of reasonable accommodation is approached and how enforcement mechanisms are not being used.We have made practical suggestions on how the position could be improved. The key suggestion is that provision could be made in the Bill to ensure it would not diminish existing rights or protections. To be more proactive, the Bill could examine the existing reasonable accommodation provisions under the Equal Status Act. There is currently a requirement to ensure reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities, subject to a nominal cost exemption. In regard to public sector services provision could be made to remove this nominal cost exemption and provide for an exemption in terms of a disproportionate burden. This would substantially improve the level of access for people with disabilities and reflect existing provisions in regard to their employment. It would be a significant development in equality legislation and improve the position of people with disabilities.We also recommend the positive duty approach to ensure public sector bodies would have due regard to the issue of equality in carrying out their functions. This approach was developed recently in Britain and is well established in Northern Ireland. It is considered a significant and effective way forward in ensuring administrative systems are put in place to take account of the fact that there are people with disabilities among the employees and those who seek to provide services. There is a challenge to target the specific needs of people with disabilities.Another key section for amendment is section 5. While it is a complex matter, it could be interpreted in the ways we have suggested whereby services to people with disabilities would become residual in nature or there would be instances where there would be no obligation to provide such services. That is the intention of equality legislation but it could be amended to ensure a ringfencing of resources to implement the provisions of the Bill. Like the proposed definition, section 5 requires significant attention and could be developed in useful ways.On the question of equality legislation being subordinate to this legislation, this relates to an exemption provided for in the Equal Status Act whereby anything required under another statute is effectively exempt from proceedings. This creates a huge space for the public sector to avoid obligations under equality legislation. It is important the new legislation should not create further barriers for people with disabilities. This is why we suggested nothing in it should diminish existing protections.On the question of whether there is a right to an assessment of need, our analysis suggests that under section 5 it is resource dependent. There are also broader issues to the extent that the statement of service could be viewed as just another document and might not relate to an assessment of need. This involves significant resource issues. In terms of bureaucracy, we suggest that this would probably be costly and that a more economic approach would be to use existing equality infrastructure such as the Equality Tribunal to resolve issues. This would mean claims could be investigated and mediation services would be available in resolving issues. I will come back to the issue of equality of opportunity.Deputy McGrath raised the issue of the definition which we have covered in terms of its potential to restrict groups of people with disabilities. Section 5 and the matter of resource are major issues. They could do with clarification and further development to ensure the legislation will mark a meaningful step forward for people with disabilities. The issue of resources is a dominant one and probably lies at the heart of many of the problems being experienced. The extent to which it can be advanced and how the legislation will underpin the multi-annual budgeting programme approach will be crucial.We have set out the tensions regarding the requirement reasonably to accommodate access to buildings and services as opposed to the more limited approach in the Act. It is limited because it is a smaller group of people, because of the phrase "as far as practicable", because there are timelines up to 2015 and because access to services is about access to integration rather than to services per se. This area comes to us constantly, in terms of casework under the legislation. Planners and builders could be more creative, but above all they could be more conscious of design for a diversity of people.We are astounded by the level of inflexibility both in employment settings and in service provision settings in relation to making reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities. That is why we see this as such a powerful tool in improving the situation of people with disabilities. A further enhancement of that provision in our equality legislation through the disability legislation would mark a dramatic step forward.We did some research on employers, more than 3% of whose employees have a disability and on employers who are below the 3% level. We found the major difference was in the way people counted employees with disabilities, not in what they did or did not do. We have quite some way to go before employers, in the public or private sector, develop adequate approaches to the employment of people with disabilities and to the reasonable accommodation of those employees.We can point to some areas of good practice where more planned and systematic approaches to reasonable accommodation have come into play and where there is a commitment to recruiting people with disabilities and a capacity to dialogue with people with disabilities in relation to their needs and how best to meet them; in other words, where there is an assessment of need and a response to that need. That is why we have focused some attention on the assessment of need in the disability Bills and the importance of that becoming broader to include an assessment of need in relation to the reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities across the whole health provision and education sectors.Deputy Hoctor also raised the issue of definitions, which I hope I have answered. We have probably used the terms "equality" and "equality of opportunity" interchangeably in the submission. "Equality of opportunity" is the wording used in the legislation. It is not actually defined in the legislation and we have sought to bring forward an understanding of equality which includes non-discrimination, accommodating diversity and taking steps to take people's diversity into account. It must also include positive action and the promotion of full equality in practice. "Full equality in practice" is an interesting set of words which has only recently come into the equality legislation on foot of the EU directives. Positive action is now allowed in the employment equality Acts in relation to achieving full equality in practice. It is a useful goal to have established in legislation.

Does any organisation, semi-State or private, jump out at Mr. Crowley as a good example of employment of people with disabilities? Is there an example at EU or international level? Has any company reached a level of 5% employment of people with disabilities?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	68	That would also involve methods of counting, defining people with disabilities and who decides whether one is a person with a disability or not. We look at the systems, practices, procedures and policies which are in place. I do not say there is no example. There are examples. Our research of employment in the public sector tried to identify good practice. We used the figures provided to see who was doing well and who was not. The only difference we found was in the ways people counted. That is not to say there are not individual examples of good practice. There are, in both the public and private sectors, and we need to learn from those.In most instances, there is a failure to be planned and systematic in the approach to employing people with disabilities and to making reasonable accommodation for them. That is reflected in very high unemployment levels among people with disabilities.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I find it very hard to accept that our companies, whether public or private, have not delivered in employing people with disabilities. Recently, I was in a school of 350 boys where I was told there was no child in the school with a disability. That does not represent a cross-section of Irish society. There is something radically wrong with the structures of our system when a school of that size has no child with a disability.I say the same with regard to the private sector. Last year, a television company told this committee it employed one young woman with Down's syndrome. The company was making a big deal of that. We are way behind and we have much work to do.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am not saying companies have not delivered in the private and public sectors. Significant numbers of people with disabilities are employed, particularly in the public sector but also in the private sector. I am saying we could do much better, particularly when we look at the very high unemployment levels among people with disabilities.Part of doing better involves developing new and more effective practices in this area. A key measure is to ask whether or not a classroom or an employment setting reflects the community in which we live. The answer in many instances is that it does not do so adequately and sometimes not at all.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	71	It is interesting that Deputy McGrath raised that matter. I have had experience in the past of disabled people going into schools. To a very great extent their being accepted depends on the ethos established by the school principal. Some schools are great in that respect. Others are very reluctant. Perhaps there should be some way places of education are included as well as places of employment.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Several groups representing people with disabilities have mentioned to the joint committee that all is not well, even where the 3% target is achieved or attempted. Many people with disabilities remain on the bottom rung of the ladder in local authorities or other places of employment. They miss out on advertisements for promotion. More work remains to be done in this area.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	73	That is the core challenge. Presence in the work force means presence at all levels. There are significant gaps there. Recent research in the Civil Service shows that there has been some level of progression, which is encouraging.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	74	A lot done, more to do.We have received a huge number of submissions from a large number of different groups. They have all been very helpful. Your submission, Mr. Crowley, has been very helpful indeed. The joint committee is very grateful to you for coming here and giving your time today. You might frame certain proposed amendments for the benefit of members who might wish to put them. I am sure you will be in touch with us in time.The joint committee went into private session at 3.50 p.m. and adjourned at 3.54 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 December 2004.
