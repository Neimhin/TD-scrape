Will the Minister clarify if this figure is correct and make a statement on the matter?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	4	I share the view expressed by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and take seriously the comments he made concerning the commencement of business. As Deputy O'Callaghan will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda Síochána, including training. As Minister, I do not have a direct role in the matter. It is important to note, however, that members of An Garda Síochána undertake a wide variety of roles that require different sets of skills from time to time and different types of training, including, for example, in respect of child protection, crime scene examination and cybercrime. It is not necessary for every member of An Garda Síochána to have specialist knowledge of every area of policing. The system does not work in that way. In the case of advanced driving skills, not all members are required to drive on a daily basis or to have the capacity to respond to emergency response calls in a high-speed vehicle. Responsibility for training lies with the Garda College and the divisional continuing professional development schools under the overall responsibility of the executive director for human resources and people development. I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a review of its driver training programmes in 2009, An Garda Síochána introduced a five level suite of competency based driving, CBD, courses, with each level specifically catering for the required knowledge base, skill set and operational requirements of members undergoing the relevant training. The review was informed by the Garda Inspectorate’s report into roads policing. I understand that CBD level 2 is a three-week course which enabling those members who successfully complete the course to drive the majority of patrol cars and public order vans available to the Garda. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that since 2009, in the region of 2,700 members have successfully completed this level of training course. This figure does not include those who completed driver training prior to the introduction of the new competency based driving programme. 
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	5	While I am fully aware that the Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for Garda training, the Minister has political responsibility for An Garda Síochána. As such, I cannot directly question the Garda Commissioner but I can directly question the Minister on behalf of members of the public, which is what I am doing. It is important to note concerns raised by the Garda Representative Association that more than half of all front-line gardaí are not qualified to drive with flashing blue lights and cannot respond to emergency call-outs. The fact that no training course is provided for pursuit driving, other than the training provided in the emergency response unit, was highlighted in October 2014 when a woman died tragically after being struck by a vehicle being pursued by members of An Garda Síochána. The lack of training was also highlighted by the Regency Hotel shootings in 2016 when it emerged that the driver of one of the first patrol cars to respond was not qualified to drive either at speed or with his siren or blue lights on. This is a matter of a concern. The Minister stated that 2,700 gardaí have completed the CBD level 2 course since 2009. However, he did not answer my question as to what percentage of members of An Garda Síochána had received CBD level 2 training to enable them to drive at high speed during pursuits.

I understand consultations have taken place with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other police services to identify international best practice with regard to models of training. Pending the outcome of the review, I am advised that places on driving courses will continue to be allocated on a scheduled basis with priority being given where there is an immediate operational demand for drivers in a division or unit. In this regard, I point to the availability of a range of Garda driver training courses to meet the operational demands of the Garda. Two training centres are in operation at the Garda College and Garda headquarters, respectively. There are currently 31 Garda members - five sergeants and 26 gardaí - assigned to driver training duties. This will feed into the review. I am keen to ensure the best skills are available to An Garda Síochána.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	7	While I appreciate the Minister's response, he has not answered my simple question. Is the statement by the Garda Representative Association that up to 50% of members of An Garda Síochána do not have the training qualification that would enable them to engage in high-speed chases correct? I and other Deputies have asked this question of the Department numerous times but for some reason it will not give an answer, other than to provide the partial answer given previously, namely, that 2,700 gardaí have completed CBD level 2 training since 2009. We need to know the reason for the withholding of this information. While this is a serious matter, I cannot understand that it would be a matter of such sensitivity that the detail could not be placed in the public domain. Members of the public are entitled to be confident that members of An Garda Síochána are sufficiently trained and qualified to engage in high-speed chases. The Minister is correct and I accept that not every member of An Garda Síochána needs to be involved in high-speed chases or to engage in driving duties. However, we must ensure a sufficient percentage of members of the force are qualified to do so. As we know from experience, issues arise immediately for An Garda Síochána that require urgent involvement of a Garda car. 
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	8	I provided figures and I will repeat that the number of gardaí who have been trained to CBD level 2 currently stands at 2,700. This figure does not include gardaí who were trained to an equivalent level prior to the introduction of the competency based framework. I take issue with the attempt to draw a distinction between gardaí on the front line and other gardaí. It is indicative of a fundamental misunderstanding of what amounts to the nature of modern policing. A member of An Garda Síochána whose duties focus, for example, on liaising with victims of crime or the forensic examination of crime scenes is very much on the front line of policing. It is not necessary for all gardaí to be equipped with specialist driving skills, whether they are in cars or otherwise.

One of the key points raised in the discussion was a review of recommendations made in a 2012 report dealing with the approach of An Garda Síochána to child sexual abuse cases. The review found that only half the actions the Garda Inspectorate required the Garda to implement to properly protect children had been taken. Given the seriousness and nature of this type of crime, this is a matter of serious concern given the time that has elapsed since the report was produced.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	10	As Deputy Ó Laoghaire will be aware, decisions regarding the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including updating of information and communications technology, ICT, systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. As Minister, I do not have a direct role in the matter. However, the unprecedented investment which is being made by the Government in Garda ICT should be noted.Some €342 million, including €217 million in additional funding under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda information and communications technology infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. This will enable An Garda Síochána to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime. In addition, this significant investment will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on crime investigation, as mentioned by the Deputy. I am informed by Garda authorities that, for operational reasons and to safeguard the ability and capacity of An Garda Síochána to investigate online child abuse and exploitation offences, it is not possible to identify the particular information technology systems and tools in use. However, I can tell the House and Deputy Ó Laoghaire that the Garda authorities assure me they are currently satisfied with the IT tools available to investigate online child abuse and child exploitation offences. They will continue to monitor, develop and further invest in what can be described as international best practice. This includes investment in emerging technologies in this regard and working in partnership with other policing services. More generally, it might be of interest to the House to note that Part 2 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a range of offences related to the sexual exploitation of children.
#DonnchadhOLaoghaire	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-party	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-dob	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	11	I am keen to identify some of the issues highlighted in the review. Six items have not been not implemented at all, six have been partially implemented and four have not been satisfactorily addressed. The Garda Inspectorate has said this is disappointing and has had a negative impact on the services currently delivered to victims. A total of 66% of all sex crimes reported to the Garda involve child victims. This is a significant and serious category. The inspectorate found that victims were being dealt with by untrained gardaí; gardaí assigned to specialist child protection units had not received any child protection safety training; convicted offenders were not being properly supervised upon release; and there were communication failures between the Garda and Tusla. Of most particular concern is the fact that technology is available to the Garda to provide real-time intelligence on those accessing child abuse material. However, this technology is not being activated because of the additional demands it would produce and the difficulty in allocating time to assess it. Does the Minister agree that is clearly not a satisfactory state of affairs and needs to be addressed urgently?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	12	I wish to acknowledge the ongoing and evolving situation regarding technological advances. I am keen to ensure, as is the Garda Síochána, that Garda equipment and investigative capacity is in a position to keep abreast of these changes. I acknowledge the reforming nature of our legislation and in particular the recently enacted Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act. The Act significantly strengthens existing criminal law in combating child exploitation. I also acknowledge the success of Operation Ketch being carried out by An Garda Síochána. The operation specifically targets those in the business of possessing and distributing child exploitation material. I wish to highlight the ongoing training and the Commissioner's five-year modernisation and renewal programme. The programme involves training for gardaí to ensure they are fully up to speed and can deliver a police service that, in the circumstances, is proper and adequate.

However, addressing this also involves resources of time and ability. Again, I make the point that technology is available but it is not being activated because the resources do not exist. Mr. Toland appeared before the committee this morning. He welcomed the protected services bureau developments. However, he expressed the view that he was concerned because the numbers involved would be too few and the bureau would develop too slowly.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	14	I acknowledge the manner in which the Garda Síochána is adapting to deal with emerging issues. I understand the matter was adverted to at the committee. The Deputy should note the significant reform programme. It is well under way in line with the Government five-year reform programme. The key driver of the reform is the Commissioner's five-year renewal programme from 2016-21. That takes on board the recommendations of the report of the Garda Inspectorate, Changing Policing in Ireland. The report included an extensive review of the culture within An Garda Síochána and identified significant scope for change. I wish to assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring that an adequate level of resources is available. We have unprecedented Garda resources in this year's budget amounting to a sum of €1.6 billion. The implementation of the reform plan will continue to be overseen by the Policing Authority. It is clear that the progress reports submitted to date highlight the critical importance of this role. I wish to assure the House that every effort will be made by Government to ensure adequate resourcing of An Garda Síochána.

I want to raise the question of the number of children and adults who have been given anti-social behaviour orders in 2016 and 2017 and the number of anti-social behaviour orders sought in the same period by children and adults. Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	16	I have circulated a reply to the Deputy with figures in tabular form. I hope he has a copy of it. They are the most readily available figures from An Garda Síochána on anti-social behaviour warnings. The figures are broken down by Garda region. I hope the Deputy finds the information useful. I can assure Deputy Lahart that An Garda Síochána remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by continuing to work with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality-of-life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses, especially in the matter of the night-time economy, and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. In setting up the ASBO regime in 2007, these interventions, including warnings, good behaviour contracts and referrals to the juvenile diversion programme, were intended to address the problem behaviour. The rationale was that if they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order. It was only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that a court order would then be applied for. It is widely acknowledged the use of anti-social behaviour orders is only suitable in certain limited circumstances. Indeed, it is only one crime prevention option open to An Garda Síochána in tackling this type of crime. As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda Síochána already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. These measures are underpinned by a comprehensive legal framework. Of course, addressing local community concerns on public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda Síochána's national community policing model. A range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda Síochána in numerous legislative instruments recently enacted in the House.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	17	I have got the figures. The metropolitan regions that concern me include Dublin southern and Dublin western. No anti-social behaviour orders were given out in those regions in 2017 or 2018. When the Minister was the Opposition spokesperson for justice, he criticised the ASBO system as being too cumbersome to be effective. At the time, he commented on how the system had spectacularly underperformed. What has the Minister done to address this? I have only received the figures in the past minute. In some of the regions the level of ASBO warnings has been spectacularly declining. Does the Minister believe the anti-social behaviour order mechanism has been a failure?I am aware from my own constituency that community gardaí are the key to addressing anti-social behaviour. In 2010, there were almost 1,200 community gardaí in the State. Last year, there were 691. Given that the Garda Síochána and Deputy Flanagan, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have, as he stated, unprecedented resources to allocate to the force this year, can he make a statement to reassure people in different constituencies that every effort will be made in respect of the anti-social behaviour order, which is a significant mechanism available to the Garda Síochána at community level, to significantly improve the quality of life of law-abiding citizens, who account for 99% of the people and whose lives are seriously discomfited by anti-social behaviour?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	18	I acknowledge Deputy Lahart's interest in this issue and, indeed, his expertise as a Dublin Deputy working in the community. In response to his question about community policing, it plays a significant part in tackling anti-social behaviour. It plays a vital role in deterring all forms of crime. The unprecedented level of resources that this Government has made available to An Garda Síochána will ensure that the Garda Commissioner, in the matter of decision-making, will have that level of resources to deploy in a way that was not the case in the past. From my perspective, community policing is at the heart of An Garda Síochána. It provides a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations. I welcome the strong emphasis in the modernisation and renewal programme on developing and supporting the ethos of community policing across the State and, indeed, in urban areas such as Deputy Lahart's constituency.

I will give him some examples. In my constituency there are multiple low-grade examples of menacing anti-social behaviour. Both people living in local authority estates and people living in some private estates in my constituency want to leave because of the anti-social behaviour of neighbours or other teenagers and young people living in the constituency whose activities are simply not addressed by the Garda. Local authority tenants simply cannot bear to continue living where they are living because of anti-social behaviour and cars set on fire are making public parks unusable by the vast majority of residents who live in that area. A few weeks ago, a serious incident took place at a DART station in Clongriffin where up to 20 young people, allegedly wearing balaclavas and armed with knives and lumps of wood, blocked the doors of a train at approximately 10.30 p.m. Other examples of anti-social behaviour in Killinarden in relation to buses caused Dublin Bus to withdraw some of the fleet for particular periods. There is a significant amount of low grade, and some high grade, menacing anti-social behaviour that is making residents' lives incredibly difficult. Will the Minister address specifically what he intends to do with regard to anti-social behaviour orders, whether they are working and whether the system is in need of overhaul?

That type of activity has no place in a modern civilised society. However, I do not agree with the Deputy if he is asserting that the anti-social behaviour legislation has been a failure.

There is the Criminal Damage Act 1991, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which was amended in 2003, and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, to name but a few. All these legislative provisions are constantly under review. I assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána is proactively targeting public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities. It is up to me to provide the resources for that and to ensure that the legislative provisions are in a position to act as a vital tool for An Garda Síochána in order that crime be detected, investigated and successfully prosecuted.

The allegations were upheld in an investigation conducted by the acting Garda Commissioner, Dónall Ó Cualáin, and yet, over four years on, nobody has been charged and nobody has been arrested. What is the Minister doing in respect of this matter? Is he satisfied with the way it is being dealt with? When can we see action being taken?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	24	Deputy Clare Daly will be aware from previous questions on this issue that the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 was enacted to allow employees to bring alleged wrongdoing to the attention of the appropriate authorities. The Act also affords important protections to persons making protected disclosures and specifically included the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, as a designated body for receipt of protected disclosures. The protections afforded under the Act include protection from dismissal and other forms of penalisation and for the protection of the identity of persons making disclosures. The protected disclosure that the Deputy refers to was not made to me, as Minister. As I understand it, the protected disclosure was made directly to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission by the member named by the Deputy. This House will be well aware of the independence of GSOC and I need not labour the issue, except to state that GSOC's statutory independence prevents me from interfering in any matter that that body is currently investigating. That is the guarantee of the independence of GSOC and the guarantee to persons making complaints that their complaints will be considered independently and free from outside interference and particularly free from any form intervention in this House. I have full confidence in the role that GSOC plays in investigating complaints of wrongdoing in the Garda, including protected disclosures from members. I urge Deputy Clare Daly to allow GSOC the time and space necessary to carry out its investigations. Often what may seem like a simple enough issue to the member in question conceals a large degree and layer of complex legal issues involved. The Deputy should bear in mind that GSOC has a responsibility to persons making complaints, as well as to those against whom allegations are made and I want to see a full, complete and impartial investigation in order to allow the independent body arrive at the truth.

He will not escape behind this and this will haunt him unless he starts dealing with it properly. The Minister states GSOC needs time. It is the fifth year since this complaint was made. It involves gardaí involved in the heroin trade in the Minister's constituency. One young man has died - possibly two - as a result of that heroin supply. A garda remains suspended at present for colluding with criminals but nobody has been charged or arrested. There was an internal Garda investigation, as the Minister will be aware. Subsequently, GSOC was given the file, which was delayed and disrupted by the Garda for five months. The Minister knows GSOC has concluded that investigation but it cannot publish its findings because the Garda states it has not finished its investigation. I am seriously wondering is this biding for time a tactic to allow the clock to be wound down until the garda at the centre of this or the chief superintendent behind him reaches retirement age, which is coming up in the next year and a half. We are all in favour of impartial investigations but a process which does not deliver in its fifth year is disgraceful, considering the very serious allegations at the heart of this.

If I have not done so before, I say to her now that she has a responsibility to act accordingly in respect of any information which she has or which comes across her desk in respect of the alleged commission of a crime. I trust that she has done so. I want to again emphasise that I have no authority to direct the Garda Commissioner in matters concerning the control or operation and direction of An Garda Síochána, nor can I, as Minister for Justice and Equality or a Member of the House, interfere in any investigation undertaken or being undertaken by the force. This may be difficult for Deputy Clare Daly to accept, but she and others know that they would be very quick to point out to me the flaws in any system which would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to interfere in any way with the role of the Garda Commissioner or to seek to direct the Garda Commissioner or exercise any undue influence over him or her as to the manner in which he or she might handle a workplace issue or investigation.

It was pointed out to the Minister more than a year ago that the investigations have concluded. The Minister for Justice and Equality calls these organisations to account. It is a fact that An Garda Síochána breached existing protocols with GSOC and refused to hand over files for five months. It is a fact that An Garda Síochána refused GSOC's request to sit in on the disciplinary hearings on behalf of four gardaí who were found guilty of wrongdoing. The only thing that has happened since the investigation concluded is that nobody has been penalised except the poor eejit who made the protected disclosure in the first instance and who has been out of work, sick, bullied and harassed. People who undermined him in the workplace have been promoted since then. The Minister sent us a letter last December referring to a discussion we had last July - almost a year ago. At that time, he gave the same answer as that which he has just provided. Does the Minister think it is acceptable that these organisations sit on reports for years on end and nothing happens? That is the type of justice we have in Ireland in this day and age.

I want to remind the House yet again that I am awaiting the outcome of any investigation which An Garda Síochána or GSOC is engaged in. I want to remind Deputy Clare Daly that term of reference [p] of the disclosures tribunal covers complaints by members of the Garda who made protected disclosures prior to 16 February 2016 or who were, as a result, in any way discredited or targeted with the knowledge or acquiescence of senior members of An Garda Síochána.

There are also 17 Garda reservists and 32 civilians attached to the division. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the armed support unit, the Garda national economic crime bureau and the Garda national drugs and organised crime bureau. As I have stated in the House previously, the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda strength of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. Real and tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. Funding is in place to ensure that the 2021 vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 remains very much on track. This year, a further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College - 400 have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year. The Deputy will be aware of the current recruitment campaign which was recently inaugurated by An Garda Síochána. I am keen that every part of the country, including the south-east region, will benefit from increased Garda numbers.

I raised the issue of under-resourcing in the context of sergeants and inspectors in County Wexford in order to convince the Government of the need to provide additional resources. I commend sergeants, inspectors and superintendents who are doing their duty across the country, including those officers in County Wexford who are working with insufficient resources. Garda representative organisations have consistently pointed out that a lack of resources is hampering their ability to tackle criminal gangs that are targeting rural areas. Fianna Fáil secured a commitment in the confidence and supply agreement to bring Garda numbers up to at least 15,000. Wexford Garda stations need more sergeants and inspectors to help bolster their positive policing abilities. The problem is particularly acute in north Wexford, where Gorey district was downgraded during the term of office of the previous Government. It lost its superintendent and now has only one covering Enniscorthy and Gorey. An extra 50,000 people visit Gorey during the summer period. This means that Garda resources are being spread thinly across the area and that is having a serious impact.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	32	On Garda strength in the Wexford division, the Deputy will be aware that there are now more gardaí than has been the case since before 2009. I am sure he is very keen that the numbers continue to increase. He mentioned Gorey Garda station. I recently had the opportunity to visit it and acknowledged the ongoing very positive and constructive work in which gardaí in the Gorey region are engaged. Next week, I will visit Wexford town and will have the opportunity to see the state-of-the-art Garda station there at first hand. I recently performed the official opening of the state-of-the-art courthouse, which is a multi-million euro development in Wexford town. I acknowledge what Deputy Browne said in respect of vacancies in the supervisory ranks of sergeant and inspector. While acknowledging that these are issue for the Garda Commissioner, I understand that competition for promotion to the ranks of sergeant and inspector are currently in train and that should be of assistance.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	33	Gardaí in Gorey recently reacted very quickly and arrested two men in a field near the town. When the Minister visited Gorey Garda station he probably noticed that the superintendent had to travel from Enniscorthy because that is where he is based. It is a very large area, encompassing Bunclody in the west of Enniscorthy to Blackwater, south to New Ross and all the way up to the border with Wicklow. If the superintendent is not reinstated, the supervisory roles need to be expanded, particularly in the Gorey area. A major issue in Wexford is the fact that the drugs unit was effectively disbanded because of a lack of resources. That has become a significant problem. Drugs are being brought in through Rosslare Europort. In fairness, gardaí and customs officers are doing the best they can, but supervisory roles are hampering Garda procedures in County Wexford and it is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	34	It is important that we ensure members of the Garda are doing the job for which they are trained, that is, both availability and visibility. I acknowledge the point Deputy Browne raised in respect of the supervisory ranks. I am advised by the acting Garda Commissioner that competitions for the positions of sergeant and inspector are currently in train. In that regard the requirements of each Garda division, including that of Wexford, will be considered by the acting Garda Commissioner when assigning the successful candidates from the competitions. I assure the Deputy that my priority is to ensure that An Garda Síochána is adequately resourced. Budget 2018 has provided for the recruitment of 800 more gardaí this year, many of whom will be fully trained, ambitious, energetic and stationed to posts in the Wexford region.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	35	The Minister said his priority is to make sure the Garda is adequately resourced. Gorey was downgraded, which was madness as it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country. The Minister also said the Minister for Justice and Equality should not interfere with the Commissioner but if the Commissioner is not responsible to the Minister who in God's name is he or she accountable to? Who is carrying out the disciplinary investigation into those investigations? Somebody is doing it but the Garda Síochána will not tell us. Could the Minister find out for us? It has been more than four years yet nobody has been arrested in connection with heroin. At least one person has died since because of heroin. Local gardaí were involved and investigations were carried out yet nothing has been done about them. How can no one be arrested for four years? Who is doing the investigation now into the disciplinary side of it?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	36	I assure Deputy Wallace, as I assured Deputy Browne, that every consideration will be given by the Commissioner to areas where specific needs are highlighted. I am happy to convey to the acting Garda Commissioner the views of Deputy Browne. The competitions for promotion in respect of inspectors and sergeants are in the course of completion. I expect that in the coming months consideration will be given by the acting Garda Commissioner to ensuring that if there are vacant posts that have been outstanding for some time, arrangements will be made to fill them at the earliest opportunity. I want to see gardaí on the streets and I want to see sergeants in a position to carry out their duties and to help and assist with probationer gardaí who are coming out from the Garda College in Templemore in a very positive stream. I am sure they will be stationed to some Garda stations in Wexford and will need the assistance, goodwill and mentoring of the station sergeants in the area.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	37	I am very interested in hearing an update from the Minister on the Government's plans for referendums in October which were announced in September 2017. There were plans for a referendum on the removal of Article 40.6.1° on blasphemy. What work has been done in that regard? I presume the Department has a key role to play in preparing for that referendum. I am keen to get an update on the Government's plans for the process.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	38	In September 2017 the Government decided on an indicative timetable for a number of referendums to be held in 2018 and 2019. Under this timetable, and subject to passage of the necessary Bills by the Houses of the Oireachtas and formal confirmation of the polling date, it is proposed to hold referendums in October 2018 on the offence of blasphemy - Article 40.6.1°.i - and on a woman's life within the home - Article 41.2. These referendums were the subject of recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention and are included in A Programme for a Partnership Government. I am fully committed to ensuring that we adhere to the timetable agreed by Government. The necessary preparatory work within my Department in conjunction with colleagues in other Departments and the Office of the Attorney General is now drawing to a close. Deputy Eamon Ryan specifically mentioned blasphemy. I wish to inform him that work on such a referendum has involved consideration of the legal issues which exist in respect of the nature of the question which should be put to the people. The issue of the provision on a woman's life within the home is being examined by my Department in collaboration with other relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General with a view to determining the best legal approach as regards the question to be put to the people. More generally, funding arrangements have been put in place within my Department and contact has been maintained both with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Office of the Ombudsman, both of which will have key roles to play in relation to the referendum process. It is my intention to seek Government approval in the near future on the approaches to be followed in respect of both referendum proposals. Securing such approval will facilitate the publication of the relevant amendment Bills before the start of the summer recess. This will ensure that a referendum commission can be established in a timely manner and will ensure that the commission will have adequate time within which to begin its preparatory work.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	39	I had not realised the Minister's Department would also take the lead role on the provision relating to the role of women in the home and I would welcome any further information he can provide in that regard. The recommendations contained in the report of the Constitutional Convention provided for a variety of different options. In terms of blasphemy it was fairly split on whether there should be any sort of statutory prohibition and there was support for a new provision against the incitement to religious hatred. The Minister said he has concluded consideration of the issue but we have to wait for a decision on the referendum before he publishes any Bill or sets out what is in the provision. If we do not proceed with a presidential election - no one knows yet what will happen in that regard - is there a risk that the referendum will be put off? The Minister said he has to go to Government with the specific proposals. Is the Minister clear that the Government will agree to hold a series of referendums in October and possibly plebiscites no matter what happens in regard to a presidential election?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	40	Yes, it is the intention of the Government to hold these two referendums in the autumn. If we do have a presidential election, which is not certain at this stage, that would seem to me to be the most obvious opportunity to ask the people of the country to cast their views on the referendums. In any event, the question to be put before the people has not yet been fully determined by the Government. Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the Constitutional Convention of which I was a member. The convention very much informed the preliminary thinking as to what the question might be that will be the subject matter of the referendum. The context is that there is need for a referendum on the specific issue of blasphemy because unless the constitutional reference is removed, the offence will be maintained on the Statute Book. In the past, the existence of this offence has been misconstrued and used to justify the maintenance of blasphemy regimes in other jurisdictions where freedom of expression is not accorded the same respect as is the case here.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	41	I asked the Minister whether his Department is the lead Department with regard to the framing of any proposed legislation on a referendum question relating to the role of women in the home. Both of the issues I raised and the question of a plebiscite on a mayor are complex issues. I seek a change in the constitutional provision on the role of women in the home but in so doing, there is a whole variety of options that we could seek to frame. I put it to the Minister that the timeline is very tight. It is now almost the end of May and we have two complex issues to consider. The first one is probably less complex than the second but they are both worthy of consideration. Is the Minister not concerned about the tightness of the timeline? When does he think the Government will make a final call on it?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	42	I am very conscious of the timeframe, and given that the Dáil intends to conclude its work on the legislative programme, and otherwise, by the end of July, it is intended to hold the referendums in conjunction with and on the same day as a presidential election. That would require an early decision by Government. While I am not in a position to advise the House on the nature of the question to be put, I would expect to bring a proposal to the Government within the next few weeks. Following that, I would be very keen to come forward with the appropriate and necessary legislation within the timeframe, as referenced by Deputy Ryan, so we would have the legislation at an advanced stage by the end of July for the referendum commission to be established and the statutory timeframe to be met, and to have an appropriate lead-in time for the autumn.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	43	The Minister will be aware that burglary and aggravated burglary are two of the most serious offences on our Statute Book. The figures also realise that when a burglary is committed and an individual is convicted of the offence, there is high likelihood that the same individual will come back again and commit further burglary offences. The recidivism rate for burglary is much higher than any other criminal act. What are the Government's proposals to deal with this issue from a policy perspective?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	44	My Department recognises that, in order to protect the public and reduce reoffending behaviour, a joined up approach to the management of offenders is crucial and essential. There are a number of ongoing joint initiatives and policies that my Department leads across the criminal justice agencies aimed at preventing crime, increasing detection of crime, rehabilitation and supporting desistance from crime by persistent offenders. The first joint strategy on the management of offenders was developed in 2016 between my Department, An Garda Síochána, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service and is being implemented on an ongoing basis. I acknowledge the importance of initiatives such as the successful joint agency response to crime, J-ARC, which involves these four bodies. This is a strategic response to the management of prioritised prolific offenders. The evidence-based, intelligence-led objectives of J-ARC target the 25% of recidivists responsible for 75% of crime; manage identified prolific offenders in order to reduce crime; and enhance public safety by strengthening the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research. In 2017, the Irish Prison Service in conjunction with the Probation Service and An Garda Síochána extended J-ARC to three new locations in Dundalk, the Kilkenny side of Waterford city and in Limerick city. A further development in this area is the youth joint agency response to crime initiative, YJ-ARC, launched in 2017. This targets young people aged 16 to 21 who are the most prolific in their offending and provides a structured co-ordination between the Probation Service, An Garda Síochána, the Irish Prison Service, the Irish Youth Justice Service, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government remains fully committed to tackling all forms of criminality and this is evidenced by the increased allocations of resources provided by the Government, with particular reference to these specific streams of funding provided by the Government.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	45	I thank the Minister. I am glad that the Minister mentioned the Irish Prison Service. Data from the Irish Prison Service shows that recidivism rates in respect of burglary and related offences is at 79.5%. This is the highest rate for any offence and it is considerably above the overall rate for recidivism of 62%. I also raise this question in the context of the recent comments by Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll when he referred to the large number of prolific burglars for whom the convictions and sentences imposed on them are not having any effect, be it a deterrent effect or otherwise. Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll has said that when the Garda drew up a list last autumn of burglary gangs it wanted to target during the winter phase of Operation Thor, the sheer extent of some of their criminal records stood out. We need to recognise that this issue causes great concern to the public. Although burglary and aggravated burglary is referred to as a property offence, it is in fact much more serious because there is a huge impact on the persons affected. I welcome the proposals the Minister spoke of with regard to his Department's policy developments but we need to do something else by way of a deterrent. Does the Minister have any proposals around deterrents?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	46	The Deputy has brought up the role of the Irish Prison Service and I acknowledge its importance. In recent years, prison services have placed a much greater emphasis on support services to prevent re-offending, and offering support towards desistance of criminal activity. The Deputy is aware there is a wide range of rehabilitative programmes including education and vocational training; healthcare; psychiatric services; psychological services; counselling; welfare; and spiritual services. Access to these services remains a critical feature for offenders in addressing their offending behaviour. A greater emphasis is now being placed on pre-release planning, on putting supports in place and on making links to services in the community for offenders who leave custody. On a recent visit to a joint agency response to crime centre, J-ARC, outside Waterford city, we saw the manner in which the service is keyed in through other services in the community, for example, in the sponsoring of employment initiatives. There is no doubt, and I invite Deputy O'Callaghan to agree with me, that the best possible course of action for young offenders of a persistent nature, once they have discharged their debt to society and are released from prison, is the provision of a job. That is a key plank of Government policy.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	47	I agree with the Minister on that point. He is correct that if any person coming out of prison can get a job, it can reduce enormously the prospect that he or she will become involved with criminality again. Unfortunately, however, the statistics reveal something more serious. The Irish Prison Service data reveals a huge high rate of recidivism of individuals who are committing burglaries. We must put forward some form of deterrent approach to the issue, as well as the admirable solutions the Minister has identified. We need to see whether we change the sentencing process. If an individual is involved in a series of burglaries that have been committed over a period of time, and where it looks as though there will be no change in that individual's behaviour, we need to look at whether stronger sentencing is required for that person. We also need to recognise that the primary purpose of burglary is to try to increase the wealth of the burglar. We need to think about imposing fines and sanctions that can be properly levied on individuals who have been convicted of these offences. There is more to this than simply trying to remedy the individual and in trying to put him or her back on the path to a proper life. Unfortunately, there are some cases where we cannot do this and we need to have stronger sanctions for them.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	48	The prison recidivism statistics study to which the Deputy refers is a detailed examination of those who were released from custodial prison sentences in 2010 and whether they were subsequently convicted of a further offence up to the end of 2013. The study findings indicate that the recidivism and re-offending rate was 45.1% for the cohort of offenders released in 2010. When compared to the equivalent cohort for the previous year, there is a fall in recidivism, albeit modest, of 2.4%. This follows a 3.5% decrease that was seen for the 2009 cohort from the previous report. I acknowledge that these are modest figures but we are moving in a positive direction. Last year saw the continued successful implementation of the joint Irish Prison Service and Probation Service community return programme and the community support scheme. These are structured, temporary release schemes that provide for supervised community service. I assure Deputy O'Callaghan and the House that I am very conscious of the issues raised and I want to ensure that every effort is made through legislation and otherwise to move towards the reduction of crime, especially in the cohort referred to by the Deputy.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	50	The distribution of Garda personnel, including the allocation of newly attested gardaí, is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that, as of 30 April 2018, the most recent date for which figures are available, the strength of the Donegal division was 394. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units, namely, the national bureau of criminal investigation, the armed support unit, the national economic crime bureau and the national drugs and organised crime bureau. I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College at Templemore and imposed a moratorium. The measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing. When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilised the public finances in September 2014, the then Government reopened the college. Since then, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána and are performing mainstream duties nationwide. A total of 32 of these officers have been assigned to the Donegal division. I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall complement of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	51	I have no doubt about the Minister's commitment to ensuring that Donegal would receive a fair and equitable share of gardaí. In 2009, Donegal had 488 gardaí. The Minister gives the most recent figure as 294, down approximately 20% since 2009. I know there have been difficulties over the years but the Minister hopes to have a total of 21,000 gardaí by 2021. There have been 1,800 recruits attested since 2014 and this year, 800 will attest. We have received only an insignificant number of those. While it may not be the Minister's responsibility, he has a duty to at least speak with the Garda authorities and tell them that I and many others have raised this matter in the Dáil. We are seeking additional gardaí for a county that has a few kilometres of border with the South, while, in the context of the North, we will have to deal with Brexit. In addition, there is our Atlantic coastline and the fact that we fear it might be used to bring drugs into the country. Donegal is different from the rest of the country. I would like the Minister to speak to the acting Commissioner or the relevant assistant or deputy commissioner and ask them to give specific consideration to Donegal.

The Deputy will be aware that only last week the acting Commissioner introduced a recruitment plan which closes on 6 June. The focus on and investment in personnel are critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation, providing the acting Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of gardaí. The ongoing nature of the recruitment will undoubtedly support Garda activities across all regions, with enhanced visibility within communities, and will enable the acting Commissioner to provide additional resources to parts of the country such Deputy Gallagher's constituency in Donegal. This can happen as the new Garda recruits come on stream.

That looks very good but I doubt whether it is the case. I presume the Minister has given us the gross number. The refurbishment of the Garda station in Donegal town is absolutely necessary. I am pleased that progress will be made. Donegal town also has a problem with numbers. The Glenties station has been there all my life. To access the two divisional headquarters one has to go right around the whole Wild Atlantic Way, the N56 from Ballyshannon. The deputy commissioner with responsibility for policing and security should examine this closely with a view to reopening the Glenties station which served the Gaeltacht areas for many years.

I can however confirm that the Garda building and refurbishment programme includes the full upgrade and refurbishment of the Garda station in Donegal town. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works, OPW, has advised that the tender documents are being prepared and it is expected that this project will be tendered in autumn of this year.

In Tubbercurry, a Garda station was built for a sergeant and two gardaí but there are now two sergeants, eight gardaí and two bean gardaí, which is totally unsuitable. There is a building next door to the Garda station that is up for sale. It was used by the national Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais, CLÁR, office which employed 110 people and housed them in two buildings. It is an ideal building. The OPW intends purchasing land to renovate the Garda station to make it more suitable for the staff there. This is an ideal opportunity. The building is being sold by the bank and could be bought at an opportune price to accommodate the badly-needed new Garda station.

One of the consequences is the need for increased facilities, one of which is the Garda stations, bricks and mortar. I would be happy to engage with the Deputy on an update on Tubbercurry Garda station, particulars of which I do not have to hand. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, will carry out a detailed review of the dispersal and use of resources in delivering policing services to the communities. What might be required for a large urban area, such as Dublin or Galway, may well be different for Deputy Gallagher in Donegal or Deputy Scanlon in Sligo but I will be happy to communicate with an update on the issue of Tubbercurry Garda station and to keep the House fully informed on the ongoing developments in the review between the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.

It is relentless. They need to know action is being taken to support families and to protect children. What action is the Government taking to support people who are being bullied online?

Together with my colleagues, the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Education and Skills, Deputies Zappone, Denis Naughten and Bruton, I appeared before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs as part of its examination of cybersecurity for children and young adults. In March, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment hosted an open policy debate with a wide range of stakeholders to consider future actions in this area. On foot of this, all relevant Departments with responsibility in this area are working together to develop a whole-of-Government approach in the form of an integrated action plan. This work is being taken forward under the auspices of the relevant Cabinet committee. It is important to remember that many forms of harmful online content and behaviours, including cyberbullying, are not necessarily criminal in nature. There is a general consensus that the appropriate response to addressing such online issues is one that encompasses educational and awareness-raising campaigns, as well as effective actions and policies on the part of Internet companies. A number of initiatives are under way across Government to promote Internet safety, particularly where children are concerned. My Department, for example, operates the Office for Internet Safety, which provides information and guidance on various aspects of Internet safety, principally in the form of online material on subjects such as filtering, using social media and the vexed question of cyberbullying. Similarly, Webwise, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, develops guidance on internet safety for use in the education sector. As Minister for Justice and Equality, my primary responsibilities in this area relate to the development of effective responses under the criminal law. An important consideration is that the criminal law targets behaviour that is illegal, whether online or offline.

Those recommendations include: the establishment of a digital safety commissioner; and the updating of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include the specific offences of harassment and stalking. What action has been taken to implement the recommendations? These are clear and measurable actions that can be taken by the Government. The Minister referred briefly to a new action plan for Internet safety which is due to be launched in June. Is that on target? If it is not, why is that the case? We need to see greater urgency in respect of this matter. Many of these issues have been highlighted previously, some as long ago as 2014.

The Deputy will appreciate that the best means by which this issue is addressed is through a whole-of-Government approach. That is why my colleagues, the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Education and Skills share responsibility in this area. From my perspective, the Department of Justice and Equality has been working to bring forward additional legislation on foot of the report of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on harmful communications and digital safety published in September 2016. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am committed to working with colleagues across politics to ensure that we make the rapid progress that Deputy Aindrias Moynihan feels is essential. I agree with him that progress is essential and I would be happy to hear from all and any Deputies who are in a position to work with me on this. I recently accepted a Labour Party Private Member's Bill along broadly similar lines to the legislation that was in the course of being drafted in my Department. This Bill has now progressed through Second Stage in the Dáil and I look forward to working on its further development as part of the overall integrated approach we are putting in place across Government to tackle these important issues.

What action has been taken by the Department on updating the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act? The specific offence of stalking must be provided for in legislation and this was highlighted in 2016. The Minister did not refer to a digital safety commissioner at all in his reply. The recommendation in that regard is that a digital safety commissioner would implement existing safety measures, support parents with information and education and inform the Minister in respect of policy. What action has been taken on the recommendation regarding a digital safety commissioner? The setting up of such an office is one step that could happen quite quickly while we wait for the aforementioned legislative measures.

She spoke of the impact of her daughter's suicide on herself and on her 14 year old son who found his sister hanging from a dog lead in the hallway of their house. She called for a review of and an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, as referred to by Deputy Andrias Moynihan. The bullying had been known about for a long time and gardaí had been involved but they felt powerless to act. I was really taken by that lady's presentation yesterday and I ask the Minister to consider meeting her. That would add a sense of urgency to where we go with this issue.

I would say to both Deputies that what we are seeing here is a whole-of-Government approach to this issue. A senior officials' group, convened by the Department of the Taoiseach, is working on the development of an appropriate action plan and feedback from the recent open policy seminar has informed the development of that plan. This work is being taken forward under the auspices of an appropriate Cabinet committee. I assure the Deputies that I am very mindful of the need to urgently review the body of relevant legislation. I refer Deputies to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which amended the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and significantly strengthened the criminal law in the matter of combating child exploitation. We are working on a whole-of-Government response. My responsibility, in the context of criminal law, is to feed into the legislative process and I hope to bring forward amending legislation shortly along the lines recommended in the LRC's report, with the assistance of Bills already drafted by other Members of this House.

I want to find out the level of resources that have been allocated to the Garda's cybercrime bureau. As the Minister knows, the bureau was set up in September 2016 and it plays a vital role in ensuring that cybercrime is properly investigated. I await the Minister's response with regard to the resources for same.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	65	I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. That said, I am informed by the acting Commissioner, on foot of a review of the computer crime investigation unit under the modernisation programme, that An Garda Síochána has the capacity and capability to deal with cybercrime and cybersecurity threats. The cybercrime bureau is under the direction of the assistant commissioner, special crime operations and is part of the Garda national economic crime bureau headed by a detective chief superintendent. The bureau has responsibility for the forensic examination of all seized computer media, international liaison regarding cyber matters and the investigation of cybercrime. Cases examined include all crime types including banking and financial crime matters in particular, as well as the examination of equipment and media to assess images in the context of offences relating to child pornography and exploitation.I am informed that as of 30 April, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the number of personnel attached to the bureau was 33, including one detective superintendent, one detective inspector, six detective sergeants, 21 detective gardaí, one higher executive officer, one executive officer and two clerical officers. Approximately 120 replacement and additional personnel have been assigned to the specialist units that have formed the special crime operation since 2017. The bureau has benefited from some of these additional resources. I understand that this has allowed some backlogs of cases to be progressed and for many outstanding cases to be completed. This is tangible evidence of the Government's focus on rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of gardaí and civilian staff across the country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	67	As the referendum campaign draws to a close, it is important to put on the record that this has largely been a very respectful debate with many people having genuinely held positions on the proposition before the people. For my own part, I can genuinely say that on the doorsteps and in meeting with people in the streets people have been very courteous and very fair irrespective of the positions they hold. It is also true to say that many people out there are still conflicted. Many people have had, and are having, difficulties making up their minds on this particular issue. They have articulated this openly to us when we have met them. That is not surprising given the issue involved, which is complex, sensitive and deeply personal for many people. Our cross-party Oireachtas joint committee dealt with the issue thoroughly following on from the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly. The recommendations of the committee have now been largely reflected by the Minister in the proposed heads of a Bill which he has published. It is important to state some key facts unequivocally in respect of that legislation. Before I do, it is important to say that if one reads all of the evidence given to the committee, all of the obstetricians who spoke to it were adamant and very clear that where a baby in the womb was viable, they would always the deliver the baby safely, no matter what the circumstances. That is reflected in heads 4 and 11 of the proposed legislation published by the Minister. In addition, it is very clear that the proposed legislation will not allow termination on the grounds of disability, which has been claimed at times. The Taoiseach can also confirm that late-term abortions are prohibited in the proposed legislation, with some exceptions in respect of fatal foetal abnormality and care in a genuine medical emergency. The fundamental point I am making is that the proposed legislation which would come before this House if there was a "Yes" vote in no way represents abortion on demand nor is it comparable to the legislative regime in the UK. That needs to be said. More than 125,000 people, or approximately that figure, have registered on the supplementary register. Many of them are young people. When I was on Charlemont Bridge with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan last week, they cycled past us in their droves. What is interesting is that many were from all over Ireland and, in many cases, will need to get back to vote on Friday. There may be challenges in doing that and I ask the Taoiseach to join with me in asking employers to be flexible in facilitating people to get out earlier to vote. It is good for our democracy.

When this debate around the referendum started some months ago, I expressed my hope that the debate would be respectful and would never be personalised. With a few exceptions the debate has been broadly respectful of opinions on both sides. In almost all cases, it has not been personalised and that has been welcome. It is very different from the experience people would have had in previous referendums. People who have been in this House longer than me have told me stories of the kind of abuse that public representatives were subject to in the 1990s and 1980s during referendum campaigns on this issue. I am glad that, in the main, that has not been the case on this occasion. I thank Deputies Micheál Martin, Mary Lou McDonald, Brendan Howlin and the other party leaders for their support for this referendum proposition.

I confirm what Deputy Martin said. Head 4 in the general scheme refers specifically to viability. It says that terminations will not occur on the grounds of health or risk to the life of the mother if the child can survive outside of the womb. In such cases, doctors will perform an early delivery and give that child all the neonatal support our paediatricians can offer. Once the baby in the womb reaches the point of viability, that is what will be done. Late-term abortions are prohibited and are only permitted in two very rare circumstances. One is in the case of a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality as a result of which the child will not survive for long outside of the womb. The second refers to those very rare emergency situations in which doctors have to act and act quickly. Written into that emergency provision in head 5 is a double immediacy test. The doctor needs to be able to act immediately and a termination must be immediately necessary. Those are very rare circumstances and something similar is indeed already provided for in the 2013 legislation.

I hope there will be a big turnout. In the referendum in 1983, only 55% of people voted. I hope more people will take part in the upcoming referendum, an important exercise in democracy. I very much appeal to employers to allow their staff to make it to the polling stations on Friday. Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. This is in order to maximise participation by people. I was knocking on doors in Clonsilla in my constituency last night and met somebody from Westmeath who will be going home to vote. It does not take a long time to get from Blanchardstown to Westmeath but there are people who will be travelling to west Cork, Donegal and other places. These are very long journeys and I hope employers will offer some flexibility to people in that regard, no matter how they decide to vote.

The Department of Health estimates that every day three women and girls consume these abortion pills. It is a story that has featured but has not been openly expressed in the public domain in the course of this campaign, not least because the consumption of the pills carries with it a potential criminal sanction of 14 years' imprisonment. This morning I had the pleasure of meeting Ms Elaine Bedford, who is from Killester in Dublin. She has now stepped into the public light to tell her story and that of her daughter, Kate. Kate was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of seven. As she got older, she suffered from polycystic ovaries and was prone to infection. From the age of 11, when she hit puberty, she was always warned against unplanned pregnancy because of her diabetes. In late 2016, Kate became very ill. Her mother tells me that she spent three days and nights in intensive care at Beaumont Hospital. She recovered from that. The following year, she fell pregnant. It was not a planned pregnancy. At that stage, Kate was 25 years of age. She was frightened. She felt cornered and snookered and believed she had very few, if any, options. She decided on abortion pills. Elaine recounted today, in the most graphic detail, the experience of her daughter consuming these pills at home alone. She said Kate took the tablets at home, was in agony and was bleeding. Kate seemed to move in and out of consciousness and Elaine could not lift the telephone to tell the doctor because Kate was terrified of that. Elaine said this hell continued for three days, with pain and bleeding. Kate's boyfriend and her mother took shifts to look after her. Elaine told me she will never forget the fear and panic in her daughter's eyes. She said that no mother should ever have to see that fear in her child's face. Kate is not alone, as we all know. Women take these pills alone, scared and in silence. They do so knowing that the eighth amendment prevents them from gaining access to the medical care they need. The result is women bleeding in their beds unable to seek help, daughters pleading with their mothers not to call the doctor out of fear, and loved ones watching on wondering how bad the situation might get. Nobody should ever be left in that position. I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me. I hope everybody in the Dáil agrees with me on this point. I ask the Taoiseach to speak to Elaine, Kate and the women and girls who will consume abortion pills today.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	95	We estimate that three women today will order abortion pills online. Three women today will receive them in the post and three women today will take them. No matter what the result is on Friday, or rather, on Saturday when we count the votes, that will continue. Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is correct that these pills did not exist in 1983 but they are around for a number of years now, or are more readily available because of the Internet. Certainly, if people did not know about them they certainly do now after the debate we have had for the past few weeks. The number of women who decide to end their pregnancies by taking an abortion pill will certainly rise in the years ahead. That is inevitable, no matter what the result on Friday. Therefore, it is my view and I believe the view of most people in this House, that it would be better if it were done safely. What we are proposing in the draft scheme of the legislation and what will become possible if the eighth amendment is removed from our Constitution is the putting in place of a doctor-led system whereby women can obtain the pills from their doctor, not from a website. They would be able to go to their doctor and the doctor could talk to them about other options, which a website does not do. Options could be continuing the pregnancy or adoption. The doctor could offer the woman counselling and, of course, there would be a 72-hour period during which women could reflect on their decision. If they decide to go ahead, it can be done safely. It is dangerous to take the pills if one is too far along but one needs a doctor to check how far along one is. It is dangerous to take the pills if the pregnancy is ectopic because they will not work. It is dangerous to take these pills if one has a bleeding disorder. How does a woman know if she does not go to see her doctor? What we want to do is put in place a new system that is much safer than the one we have now, that allows people to discuss alternatives and that is compassionate. In addition to the availability of the abortion pill, there has been another change since 1983. Pregnancies are now increasingly complex. Women are becoming pregnant much older than in the past. Owing to IVF, pregnancies are much more complex. Women with diabetes, severe epilepsy and neurological disorders must be borne in mind in this regard, and women with cystic fibrosis, for example, who might not have lived to reach the point where they could have children now can have children because of the improvements in healthcare. Therefore, there are much more complex pregnancies than in the past. Professor Mary Higgins speaks about this so well. Currently, the eighth amendment ties the hands of doctors. Doctors can intervene to end a pregnancy only if there is a risk to the life of the mother, not a risk to health. To me, a risk to life is a very low bar when it comes to what we offer Irish women facing complex pregnancies. If we have a "Yes" vote on Friday, we can change from a risk to life to a serious risk to the health of the mother. That will allow doctors to sit down with the patient, weigh up the options and offer a termination if there is a serious risk to her health. Some mothers might decide to take that risk but others might not.

Her mammy says she is a good girl. She is still a girl at 27. She is on her honeymoon but she will be home to vote. She is going to vote "Yes". There is a fundamental question for all of us as citizens, but particularly for all of us as legislators, on this matter. It boils down to this: are we prepared to look the other way as Kate and hundreds and thousands of other women take abortion pills in circumstances that we know are unsafe?Are we prepared to do that as the legislators for this jurisdiction and as people who have responsibility to shape thoughtful, responsive, inclusive public policy? I am not. I am not prepared to look the other way. Elaine, Kate's mother, is not prepared to look the other way. That is the challenge for people as they, in good conscience, arrive at their decision on Friday. Do we look the other way? Do we create this jeopardy, this threat, to the health and potentially to the lives of our women and girls?

I also know, however, that many people have been influenced by hearing some of those individual stories such as Kate and Elaine's or stories about young couples who were forced to travel to Liverpool for a compassionate early delivery, something we cannot offer in our hospitals. If there are people who are undecided, and I know many people are still undecided at this point in time, I would ask them to set aside an hour or so this evening or tomorrow evening and think about some of those individual cases because, ultimately, laws are just written in black and white. They are text on a piece of paper but what has to be behind all those laws is individuals - people and families - and how those laws will affect them in practice. I would encourage people to consider some of those real lived experiences before they vote on Friday.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	102	When the Taoiseach is thanking the parties that support the referendum he might mention parties like Solidarity-People Before Profit and others in this Dáil that brought repeal Bills here, whose members have not voted down repeal Bills and whose members are not out campaigning against repeal. In 48 hours, people will have begun voting in the referendum on the eighth amendment. Will he agree with me that this is one of the most important votes in decades in this country? It is obviously about abortion but it also about the status of women and the type of society we want. In the past two months, we have got a glimpse of what the "No" campaign think of women. They are spreading lies and half truths and whipping up fear. In fact, spreading out and out misogyny is their stock-in-trade. They meet each morning in the "No" campaign headquarters, rub their chins and wonder if there is anything to be said to put on another misogynistic poster. How about one suggesting that women will flock to have abortions once it is made legal? How about another suggesting that women will go through a physically painful procedure as their regular form of contraception? Even though we know late abortions happen in rare and tragic circumstances, let us suggest that women will hang on for six months of pregnancy, which is obviously a cakewalk, then suddenly decide they want an abortion on demand. The message behind these type of posters is thinly veiled misogyny. Instead of acknowledging that women are intelligent and equal beings who are highly responsible, as well as being the nurturers and carers of children, sick people and old people, they want to demonise women and present us as a threat. Does the Taoiseach agree that the question needs to be posed to voters about the type of Ireland they want? Do they want one advocated by the "Yes" side where women are listened to and not silenced and forced abroad or should the nation be reminded of what a "No" vote would mean? As well as saying "No" to the right of a woman to have a choice, the leaders of the "No" campaign have said "No" to contraception. They have said "No" to sex education. They said "No" to same-sex marriage three years ago. They have said "No" to divorce, to equal employment, to married women being in the public service, to working mothers, to LGBT+ rights and to gender recognition. I do not have time to go on. Does anyone think that if they somehow snatch a victory against the tide on Friday, they would not seek to impose a ban on the right to travel, a ban on the right to information and to maintain the 14-year jail sentence faced by five people using abortion pills each day? I am hopeful the "Yes" vote will be delivered by a youth and gender quake on Friday, by the thousands I see campaigning on the ground and by the 120,000 mainly young people who registered to vote, which is twice the marriage equality referendum rate, and by the women and men on the doors who have reflected back their lived experience of the reality of life now.

As regards my constituency colleague, Deputy Coppinger, I want to particularly recognise her early role in putting this matter on the political agenda and raising it in this House, perhaps at a time when many of us would have preferred not to deal with it. It is only right, now that this question is being put to the people, to acknowledge the early role of Deputy Coppinger, Deputy Clare Daly and others in that regard. In terms of the women of Ireland today, there are approximately 60,000 births here every year, which means that at this moment in time there must be about 40,000 women in Ireland who are pregnant. I absolutely agree with the Deputy. I do not believe for a second that one of the 40,000 women who are pregnant today is walking around waiting to decide on whether she will continue that pregnancy based on the decision we make on Friday or Saturday. I cannot imagine any of those 40,000 women saying that if there is a "Yes" vote she will have an abortion and if there is a "No" vote she will not. That is not how it works. Women who feel they need to end their pregnancies will do so anyway but they do so in a dangerous way, whether it is by importing the abortion pill online or, not in a dangerous way but in a higher-risk way, travelling overseas to end their pregnancies, often much later in their pregnancies than they would if they were able to access those services here in Ireland. In terms of the type of Ireland we want, I believe a "Yes" vote says that we want to have a more compassionate and caring Ireland and one that helps women in particular in a time of crisis. I believe it says that we accept the reality of abortion that already exists in Ireland and that we will manage it and regulate it here. However, I want the people who are worried about this decision, and there are many people who are worried about it and who will vote "No" in clear conscience, to know that if there is a "Yes" vote this weekend, Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate.

There are some people in this Dáil who claim to love both but they were not showing too much love in several debates in this Dáil. For example, one of the Deputies in a debate in 2010 on social welfare talked about the elephant in the room, the considerable number of young women "many of whom are still teenagers, who consider single parenthood a choice which can be financially rewarding" and about people having babies outside of committed relationships and how that must end - it was Deputy McGrath - and the idea of people having children as an escape from poverty.

I will finish by mentioning one inaccuracy that needs to be corrected and it concerns the abortion pill. Based on two of the websites, Women on Web and Women Help Women, five people a day in Ireland are estimated to use these pills. We should be accurate and not scare people about the pills. The pills are very safe. There is medical supervision in that there is a doctor-led service. It should be acknowledged that they are doctors who stepped in when doctors in Ireland would not. The real danger, however, is the fact that the law prevents people from seeking any help in the 3% of cases where they may need follow-up care. I am proud to have promoted abortion pills with ROSA and others.They are described as safe by the World Health Organization and I think we should be accurate about that.

Obviously, there are legal consequences as well. I think we all agree that it would be safer if they were legal and available here in Ireland. There are two aspects to this conversation that perhaps have not got the recognition or notice they deserve. First, abortion rates in Ireland are falling. The number of women who travel overseas to end their pregnancies giving an Irish address has actually been falling in the past number of years. That is a good thing. It is something to be welcomed. Teenage pregnancies in Ireland are at their lowest since the 1950s. We do need to ask ourselves why that is. It is because of funding provided to groups like the Rape Crisis Centres and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. It is because of sex education in our schools, the wider availability of contraception and the availability of the morning-after pill. These are changes and reforms that have happened in the past ten or 20 years that have reduced the number of crisis pregnancies, abortions and teenage pregnancies. There is a certain irony in the fact that those who are most opposed to the change we are proposing - those who are so convinced that a "No" vote is the right thing to do - are very often the same people who opposed the morning-after pill, contraception and sex education - all the things that have actually made abortion less common in the past number of years. One thing I do want to say to people because I think it is one thing on which everyone agrees regardless of whether they are on the "Yes" or "No" side is that we should continue in our efforts to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place regardless of the result at the weekend. This will mean delivering on our commitment and implementing the recommendations made by the all-party committee to make contraception more available and to improve sex education in our schools so that we can continue to see a fall in the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	108	I am also voting "Yes" and calling for a "Yes" vote on Friday but I want to raise another health matter of public importance. The Taoiseach set up the National Rare Diseases Office when he was Minister for Health in 2015. By definition, rare diseases are rare but the office estimates that something like 300,000 Irish people will develop a rare disease at some stage in their lives. Recurrent complaints to us concern the lack of clinical supports and the tortuously slow process for the approval of orphan drugs for these diseases. A case in point is the failure since 2009 to approve the drug Kuvan, or sapropterin dihydrochloride, under the process for national pricing and reimbursement. Kuvan was developed to assist citizens with the rare metabolic condition phenylketonuria, PKU, where patients have difficulty processing the amino acid phenylalanine and must live on very restricted low-protein diets. Kuvan helps many of those affected to live more normal lives. PKU was first identified in the 1930s, although the widespread heel prick test screening did not start until 1960s. Failure to give treatment to a child after the first 48 hours results in serious cognitive impairment and often severe brain damage. In 2009, the European Medicines Agency and 20 countries approved the use of Kuvan. The Minister for Health told me that at that time, insufficient evidence was submitted by Merck Serono, the manufacturers. It passed on the market authorisation to BioMarin in 2016. BioMarin submitted a new health technology assessment for sapropterin to the HSE. Nine months ago, I asked the Minister for the results of the assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. My constituents and I were very disappointed to find that Kuvan was not recommended for reimbursement last September. It was said to be not cost-effective, although even a 100% uptake has been estimated to cost only around €2.5 million per year. The figure for the per capita cost, the Taoiseach may note from his past work, is relatively small. In several Dáil replies, the Minister has told me that the assessment process is ongoing and that the rare diseases medical products technology review committee is engaged with prescribers, specialist centres and the patient representative group to try to bring forward clear reimbursement guidelines that would be expected to target sapropterin to the patient cohort for which it may be a cost-effective intervention. I appreciate the Minister's diligent responses relating to Kuvan over the past two years but after nearly ten years of assessment and as one of the countries most affected by this condition, is it not time to approve it? As the Taoiseach may be aware, one in 4,500 babies is born with PKU in Ireland. This is double the European average. I think only Italy and Turkey are somewhere near us. It is said to result from one of our Celtic genes. In 2015, the Minister told me that there were something like 350 or so referrals and 20 new PKU patients per year in the metabolic disorders unit at Children's University Hospital, Temple Street. It is estimated that around 750 patients with PKU are receiving hospital treatment. Representatives from the PKU Association of Ireland, the European association and other patients and relatives have been in regular contact so there is a very strong request that this drug would be approved.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	109	The Deputy will be aware that we have a rare disease strategy. I think it was published by the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, a few years ago. One of the recommendations in that was to establish the National Rare Diseases Office, which I had the pleasure of opening during my time as Minister for Health. If one takes rare diseases on their own, they are rare but when one adds them up together, quite a lot of people have one. They include diseases like PKU, which the Deputy mentioned, haemophilia, cystic fibrosis and others. When one adds up all of the people who have a rare disease, it comes up to a couple of hundred thousand people. It does not seem so rare when one does that. In terms of any new medicine, including Kuvan, a couple of things must be assessed. First, its effectiveness must be assessed. Does it actually do what the manufacturers say it does in terms of modifying disease and improving quality of life and life expectancy? Second, is the price being put forward by the manufacturer fair because even the richest countries are budget-limited and if we pay too much for something, there is an opportunity cost relating to the other things we cannot do as a result? Another factor is whether alternative treatments are available that might be as effective or most cost-effective. I do not think there is in this case. I believe it is an orphan drug. The assessment is done by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics in St. James's Hospital. It carries out a detailed assessment of the medicine and makes a recommendation to the HSE's national drugs committee, which makes the final decision. It is not and should not be a decision that is made by politicians for lots of reasons we all understand. It is always the case that if the manufacturer has new information and data, it can submit that and it will be examined again. I understand that when it comes to Kuvan, that is currently being done and that the application is currently being reassessed. I know the Minister has met with the parents of children who have the disease and he will, of course, provide the Deputy with an update as soon as possible.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	110	Kuvan is actually a synthetic copy of the BH4 deficiency, which causes PKU. There are many heart-rending accounts of the daily struggles of families with children with PKU to stay within their low-protein allowance, particularly given that there are few low-protein foods available in Ireland. As I said, it is ten years since the European Medicines Agency approved it for market authorisation. The health systems in most of our EU colleague countries have supported it. The Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, of which the Taoiseach will be aware, published the complete European guidelines on PKU diagnosis and treatment last year. The journal says that diet plus medicine is the best control of the condition. On the wider issue of orphan drugs, including Kuvan, does the Government foresee making any changes to the quality of adjusted life measurements in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics assessments? I have put that question to the Minister several times because it seems to be the key point when one starts talking about cost-effectiveness. Are officials in the Department of Health and the HSE working on a fairer way to assess the efficiency of treatments for rare diseases? The Taoiseach mentioned the national rare disease plan from 2014 to 2018. Are we preparing a new plan from 2019 onwards? I know that when the Minister set up the National Rare Diseases Office, it started with five part-time staff. I know the Government did not provide any additional funding in 2017 so are further funding and resources being provided for that? Above all, it is now time, as the Minister for Health will probably agree, to make sure Kuvan is approved.

As a broader issue, the Government acknowledges we have a problem here in that the process by which we approve drugs generally may be inappropriate for orphan drugs because it is the only one available; that is the nature of an orphan drug. However, the pharmaceutical industry takes advantage of the situation. When a number of medicines are available for a particular condition, pharmaceutical companies cannot overcharge for them. However, a sole producer of the only medicine can charge whatever it likes. That is an enormous problem that we and other countries are facing. The process we have for assessing new medicines is robust and good. It is scientific and independent. However, I am concerned when I see medicines available in Britain that are not available here. The NHS is not renowned for approving new medicines quickly - for example, it has not approved Orkambi for patients with cystic fibrosis. I am concerned when I see medicines available in Britain but not available here. I find it very hard to justify. The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I are in conversation with the Minister for Finance as to how we might improve that in the near future.

Given today's reports about the retirement cliff in the Civil Service there are genuine concerns over the skill mix and the expertise that will be lost in coming years. The Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants has published some staggering statistics. Some 40% of those in management positions are aged 55 and over and therefore within ten years of retirement, 33% of assistant principal officers are in the same age bracket and a further 32% of the higher executive officers. That has the potential to cause very serious imbalance. Does the Government have any plan to deal with the issues of the impact the retirement cliff will have on the quality of public services?

I was not in attendance for the briefing because I was in the Chamber, but it was very well attended. Those in attendance heard Jackie make one request. She asked that the law be updated to ensure the Garda would be able to prosecute those who cause harm or self-harm through online bullying. Specifically she called on Oireachtas Members to amend section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include the crime of digital harassment. This proposal was a key recommendation from an Oireachtas committee report on cybersafety for children and young adults published in March this year.

Obviously, as much preparation as possible needs to be put in place. When will a new constituency commission be established so that we can have the shape of it? I ask that the commission be established in advance of the June Council so that it is in a position to receive submissions once we know the shape of the new boundaries, allowing for as much time in advance for people to prepare for what might be a redrawing of constituencies.

In the Joint Committee on Health this morning and as reported on the front of The Times, Ireland edition the president of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine has said that cost was the main reason the testing of cervical smears was outsourced to American labs. It gives an insight into how the Government was not only trying to provide services on the cheap, but also how the services here had been run down and nobbled in their attempt to tender for the contracts. She said the Irish labs as part of the cost of their tender had to include pension costs on top of service costs, for example. It was said at the committee that the American labs, being aware of discussions in 2008 to outsource, had offered prices as a loss leader, basically to win the contract and put themselves in the driving seat. Will the Government commit to providing funding for the development and growth of Irish labs to hire and train properly qualified staff so that these services can be brought inhouse and not outsourced to the lowest bidder?

I think I had only been a Member of the Dáil for one year at that stage and was not in government. The Minister, Deputy Harris, was not even a Member of the Dáil. The people who were making decisions at the time have told me it was not down to cost; it was down to capacity and the fact that Irish labs were not accredited. Obviously that is something that the Scally inquiry will examine. It is important that the Scally inquiry examines all those issues because there is a genuine concern that overseas labs are used for these tests. An opportunity arises, as we introduce the new primary HPV test, to bring these screening tests back to Ireland. Some 50% have already been brought back to Ireland and in principle the Government would like to bring them all back to Ireland. However, that cannot be done overnight. It would have to be done over a phased period. The opportunity arises to do that now. We need to allow Dr. Scally to do his work in this regard. Patients who seek the best cancer care in the world go to places like Sloan Kettering, the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins in America. Doctors seeking the best training in the world go to American hospitals. They use American labs. We should not just assume somehow that American labs are inferior to Irish ones unless we have data to show that. While I do not know about any contracts back in 2008, when it comes to the current contract, the American lab that is being used currently is not cheaper than the Irish labs.

I am currently dealing with a constituent who receives monthly family income supplement, which means, in other words, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection recognises the family needs a supplementary payment in order to meet a minimum standard of living. The same family applied for a SUSI grant for their eldest child, who is hopefully going to third level in September, and they were refused on income grounds. It is appropriate that the Ministers, Deputies Regina Doherty and Bruton, are both in the Chamber. If an anomaly exists where one Department of the State sees the situation merits giving a payment to reach a minimum standard of living, and another Department of the State does not see it as appropriate that this family should receive a grant to educate their child, there must be something radically wrong. I ask that this be addressed.

The SUSI grants are being reviewed at present and I am aware of the problem to which the Deputy refers. As things stand, there is no solution but we are reviewing the grants scheme.

In a beautiful area of west Cork, Castlefreke, near Rosscarbery, there is a vibrant community that has promoted tourism for many years. As the Taoiseach is probably aware, the community has been a top award winner in the national Tidy Towns competition and it promotes the area in many ways, including by providing stunning walkways through local Coillte lands. Now, however, the community has become aware that these lands may be offered for sale to a private individual, which would put public access to these walks at risk. I might add that the area has attracted walkers from all over the globe. It may also affect access to a local graveyard where locals have been buried for hundreds of years. Fáilte Ireland, Cork County Council, Leader and the EPA have funded grants for these walks down through the years. Tomorrow night the public of Castlefreke, Clonakilty, Rosscarbery and surrounding areas will hold a public meeting to save these walks. I call on the Taoiseach to request that Coillte keeps Castlefreke woods in public ownership.

I have raised this issue since I came into this House over two years ago. All that people are getting when they reach 80 or 85 years of age is five hours a week. Is this fair? There are 168 hours in the week and to be given just five hours a week is miserly. They get no home help on Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays. I do not think the Taoiseach is listening to us at all when we raise this issue. It is not fair. People can get into nursing homes but that is not where elderly people want to finish up. They would like to stay as long as possible in their homes. I ask the Government to make more funding available to the home help service and to provide more staff.

Because of lack of investment by the Government, not only is there not an adequate service on the five days during the week, but it is non-existent on Saturdays and Sundays. Many families are completely unable to provide that level of help at weekends and they need assistance. It is not the fault of the people giving the home help that the resources are not being given to them. I call on the Taoiseach to honour the promise and commitment in the programme for Government, which clearly states that adequate home help, where it is needed, will be provided. That is not happening at present. It is disgraceful to deal with our elderly people in this way. The cheapest place to keep an older person is in his or her own home. It is where older people want to be, if they are able to be there, and they should be assisted in every way.

At the end of February there were 52,000 people in receipt of home support services but there were 6,000 people waiting for those services. These are people who are in hospital or who might have come home and who have been approved and it is causing considerable difficulties. I acknowledge the 52,000 figure is up on last year but my point is that the resources available are inadequate to meet the need. It is not just a problem in Kerry. All of us around the country are experiencing the same difficulty, in that the HSE is approving home support services but is not in a position to facilitate them. When this has been raised before, the Taoiseach comes back and says the allocation has been increased from last year. However, the allocation increase on last year is grossly insufficient to meet the current need.

As Deputy Curran said, it is meaningless to say, as the programme for Government does, that the Government is going to increase the funding every year because the numbers are running ahead of the funding and the situation is getting progressively worse. When are we going to reach this nirvana where we will have a uniform home care service and where people will receive quality support, seven days a week?

However, I also acknowledge that the demand is increasing and that demand currently exceeds supply, both financially and, sometimes, when it comes to finding staff to provide the service, even when the finance is available.Our plan of action is to develop a fair deal-type scheme for home help. As one of the Deputies acknowledged, it is sometimes easier for people to get a nursing home place now than to get home help. That is an enormous anomaly and an inefficiency. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, is now advancing work on developing a fair deal-type scheme for home help. It will not be the fair deal scheme but it will give people a guarantee of home help within four or five weeks, as is the case with fair deal.

I said neither of those things and I hope the Taoiseach will withdraw the allegation. He went on to say that I suggested we could reduce the penalty for women who have abortions from 14 years in prison. I did say that. In the Dáil yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that it is not possible. It is, of course, possible to change, by means of ordinary legislation, the criminal penalty relating to an offence under the Constitution. I will give two examples of this. Article 40.6.1° of the Constitution requires a criminal penalty in accordance with the law of blasphemy but the Defamation Act 2009 requires only a fine, not a prison term, for that offence. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the time that legislation was introduced, Dermot Ahern, said prosecutions were unlikely to result.

I accept that the Deputy did not say he would be in favour of decriminalising abortion pills. If there is a "No" vote on Friday, it will still be a criminal offence. I find it bizarre, however, that the Deputy believes this should be a criminal offence that is not enforced. Why would one keep something as a crime if one does not think it should be enforced? I find that unusual. While it may be the case that the doctor-patient relationship covers confidentiality, it would not prevent somebody else making a complaint to the police, which is exactly what happened in Northern Ireland. In that case, a housemate made a complaint against another housemate but that is not covered. The penalty of 14 years was examined by both the current and previous Attorneys General. I will explain why it is 14 years. The eighth amendment states that the right to life of the unborn, even at one week's gestation, is equal to the right to life of a pregnant woman. Therefore, the penalty has to be the same. The penalty for having an abortion has to be equal to the penalty for killing a pregnant woman, which is not infanticide because, of course, infants do not get pregnant. The penalty has to be at the level of homicide or manslaughter. The penalty in that regard is, by the way, up to 14 years.

Just last week, the Irish Postmasters Union called for a long-term commitment that these payments will continue to be transacted through our post offices. It also called for a timeline for new services under the investment plan for post offices to be made available as soon as possible. Will the Taoiseach give a long-term commitment that social welfare payments will continue to be transacted through our post offices? Will he intervene with An Post to ensure a detailed plan and a timeline for the new services to be made available in our post offices are put into the public domain as soon as possible? We must do all we can to protect all our post offices. They play a vital role in our communities and feed into the economic activity in our towns and villages.

We absolutely are making sure that we invest in our post office network. There has been a major transformation in the company's public finances in the past year since the new management has come in and started to manage change within the network. The commitment of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection involves a very substantial annual contract, which was awarded and signed only recently, on the basis of continuing payments for people who want to receive their weekly social welfare payment through the post office. My colleague has a plan to ensure we look at other options available across Government so that we can use the post office network to its fullest extent.

To my mind, nothing at all is happening in relation to the costs of insurance. Businesses are being crucified by the cost of insurance and there have been many debates in the House on the matter.

He is updating them on progress being made to reform insurance and deal with the cost of insurance. It is not true to say that no progress has been made. It is fair to say that some of the more complex matters that require progress are being dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy. He is planning to provide an update in the near future on further actions he intends to take.

The economic division in my Department supports me and the Government in developing and implementing policy to deliver sustainable and regionally balanced economic growth and quality jobs, and to promote effective planning and delivery of infrastructural developments, including housing. The Cabinet committees and senior officials groups, supported by the division, help to deliver and implement policies in these areas. Cabinet Committee A deals with issues relating to the economy, jobs, the labour market, competitiveness, the digital economy, trade, the action plan on rural development and pensions. It last met on 18 January and will next meet on 11 June.  Cabinet Committee D covers infrastructure investment and delivery, housing and climate action and provides political oversight in relation to Project Ireland 2040. The committee last met on 1 February and its next meeting is not yet scheduled. The division also monitors implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs, leads Ireland's participation in the annual European semester process and prepares the annual national risk assessment which provides an opportunity to identify and consider potential economic risks and challenges on a structured basis. The draft of this was approved at Cabinet on Tuesday and will now go out to consultation over the next four-month period. Cabinet Committee D is also responsible for liaison with the Central Statistics Office, CSO. It co-ordinated the recent completion and publication of the national policy statement on the bioeconomy and works with the EU division of my Department on the possible economic impacts of Brexit. A unit within the economic division also supports the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection, Deputy Pat Breen, and contributes to a whole-of-Government approach to the challenges and opportunities arising from the increased digitisation of modern life. The division is also leading work that recently commenced on a framework for a new national digital strategy. The division also provides me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues. Given its role, the division works closely with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and in other Departments, which have lead responsibility in specific policy areas.

I was at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government this morning where departmental officials gave us the latest figures. They show that there are 86,000 families on the housing list. It is, however, much larger. We were also told that there were 36,000 people on housing assistance payments, HAP, schemes and 22,000 on rental accommodation, RAS, schemes. In reality, that means we have 144,000 households on the housing list. Given the rental spiral happening and the extraordinary difficulty in many parts of the country of getting private landlords and the private sector to deliver HAP tenancies - in many cases they are pulling out of those tenancies - is there any recognition that HAP is just an accident waiting to happen? The reliance that the Government is putting on it in Rebuilding Ireland is an accident waiting to happen. As a supplement to that, even if it was delivered, does the Taoiseach have any estimate of how much it would cost? I refer to the target of outsourcing to the private sector about 83,000 of the planned 133,000 social housing units. I do not believe that they can be delivered under HAP and RAS. However, even if they were, is there any estimate of how much that would cost on an ongoing basis? Dr. Rory Hearne and Dr. Mary Murphy have estimated that it would cost us €23 billion over 30 years. That would be a massive drain on the public purse and that money would be far better spent investing in council housing rather than it leeching out in billions to the private sector.

Deputy McDonald has met many times with the various chambers around the country. Many trends arise in many places. It is the same, for instance, in the south east as in the north west. There is an absence of ensuring basic necessary infrastructure projects. Rosslare Port is one and the western rail corridor in my area is another. It has been left out. Most sensible people looking at the issue of the broader need for economic development consider that it is largely about our infrastructure and what infrastructure needs to be put in place. I refer to transport infrastructure in particular. The issue of Brexit means that ports where we can directly export goods from our island to other European Union countries - rather than having to go through Britain - may be very important in future. Project Ireland 2040 plan has a huge absence in doing anything on that. I ask the Taoiseach to address this and to let me know exactly what the Government intends to do. I refer in particular to the western rail corridor. It runs from Sligo all the way down the west coast and goes right out to Rosslare Port. It would be a perfect access for goods and would regenerate an entire section of the country which has the most potential for economic development.

In economic terms the amount involved is ridiculous. It is €500 million. We have a housing crisis and €500 million might go to address something like housing for older people. That would produce a rate of return as opposed to investing this €500 million somewhere around the world in whatever the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, comes up with to invest in. Any impact of this amount on the Government's finances is trivial. It a completely phony arrangement designed to shore up the Government's economic credentials. I do not understand the logic of it. When is the fiscal space going to be determined? It is €1.8 billion for new measures, excluding demographic pressures and public pay costs. The precommitted expenditure is €2.6 billion. When will the amount of fiscal space be officially confirmed? The Taoiseach also noted people doing various economic things in his Department. How many economists are employed in his Department?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	186	I think 25 people work in the economic division of the Taoiseach's Department. It is also responsible for statistics and supporting the Cabinet and Cabinet committees in respect of housing. Is the Taoiseach happy to stand over his claim that he made at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis last year that the Government had a plan and the plan was working in respect of housing? On housing statistics, I asked the Taoiseach last week to give an assurance that 100% comparability would be maintained between current and previous homelessness statistics. I also asked that he would not allow a situation where future statistics excluded groups that were previously included. It is fine if he wants to publish a new set of statistics. Denying people the ability to compare like with like is, however, not okay. This concern is obvious because the deterioration in the situation in the past two years is shocking.Overall homelessness is up 85%, with child homelessness increasing by an unprecedented 125%. In health, the past seven years have been spent meddling with figures in an attempt to cover up lengthening waiting lists and underestimates of costs. The same behaviour cannot be tolerated when it comes to homelessness. As the Department of the Taoiseach is in charge of official statistics, will the Taoiseach assure Members that full comparability in housing and homelessness statistics will be maintained? 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	187	When it comes to our economic and social policies more generally, the Government really works under six main principles. The first is managing our public finances prudently, having got into a situation where the budget is balanced and running surpluses on occasion, and paying down the national debt.  The second principle is full employment and we will reach our targets in that regard that quite soon. We are expecting that figures in June will indicate that more people in Ireland are at work than ever before. We also want to make sure that employment is quality employment that pays well, gives people a degree of security, is family friendly and provides pensions. Auto-enrolment is a part of that plan. The third principle is raising living standards. Living standards in Ireland are rising, deprivation and poverty are falling and income inequality is narrowing, which we know from the CSO statistics.  The fourth principle is investment in infrastructure, housing and healthcare, with a focus on transport. Next year there will be a 25% increase in our infrastructure budget compared with this year. We have set out how we will spend €116 billion on public infrastructure over ten years. The fifth principle is the reform of public services. We have now reversed the cuts in terms of spending. Education and health spending are at an all-time high. We now need to make sure that those additional, record resources actually result in good outcomes and good results for taxpayers, students and patients.  The sixth principle is the idea of Global Ireland and doubling our global footprint. We will produce a detailed plan on that in the next couple of weeks.  Everyone acknowledges that we have a housing shortage in Ireland, and we are all aware of how that happened. There was a seven-year period during which the Government could not afford to build social housing, the banks could not finance the construction of housing and the construction sector was on its knees. Virtually no houses were built in the country during that time and we now have a deficit of approximately 250,000 units, in terms of additional houses and apartments that need to be built. We added 7,000 houses to the social housing stock in a number of different ways, including purchases from developers, direct builds by councils and direct builds by approved housing bodies. That is the biggest increase in our social housing stock for many years. Having added 7,000 houses to our social housing stock next year, we plan to increase that to 10,000 or 11,000 a year, which the amount of social housing we need. We have to build up to that number; they cannot all be built at once.  The conversation around housing should not revolve around social housing entirely. We need to bear in mind that the vast majority of people do not qualify for and do not want social housing but rather want to buy their own homes and to save for that. However, there is a need to provide homes for that purpose which are affordable. In my constituency house building is really taking off again. As 18,000 new homes commenced construction in the past year, we are a little bit short of what is required to get to equilibrium, which is approximately 25,000. We believe we will get to that number next year and it will rise again to 35,000 the year after. The plan is working but it is working slowly, which is an inevitability, unfortunately. Housing construction cannot be ramped up as quickly as we would like, given that it reached such a nadir as a consequence of the financial crisis. I am aware that there is a very active debate on homelessness statistics. Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Eoin Ó Broin are debating the issue all the time. I am not particularly interested in getting involved in that debate. Both figures, 9,000 or 10,000 people, in emergency accommodation represent too many people; there are many more than there used to be and I am not going to pretend otherwise. It is important that we focus on solutions and do not argue over categories and subcategories but if others want to have that debate, they are welcome to have it.

It misses the point, quite frankly. We have asked the CSO to do some work on tracking accurately the number of new homes being built, because that is unclear at the moment. Some people base their figures on ESB connections, which is fairly accurate because it includes new homes and homes that have been off the grid for two years, which is as good as a new home. However, as it can also include things such as outhouses on farms, it is not a perfect statistic, even though it is a good one. Some people use BER certifications, which is also not perfect because one-off housing regularly does not require BER. We have asked the CSO to come up with a reliable set of figures it can stand over when it comes to new home building and we expect it to report on that in the next few months. As for homelessness, we have not asked the CSO to do that but it is a possibility that we could ask that the current figures be suspended and to ask the CSO to produce something more accurate that everyone can stand over. I do not believe anyone disputes statistics produced by the CSO. Statistics from Departments may be disputed, and people rightly dispute those that come from interest groups such as NGOs and others, but nobody disputes the figures from the CSO. It is probably the best organisation to provide these numbers. Deputy Martin Kenny asked about investment in ports. If one looks at Project Ireland 2040, investment in our ports is specifically mentioned. Our ports are commercial entities, even though they are State-owned. The details are provided on port expansion plans for Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes.

We contacted the owner, Irish Rail, specifically to ask if there were any plans to upgrade that port, and unfortunately there are none. We may need to work on that. The fact that it is owned and controlled by Irish Rail is a difficulty because Irish Rail tends to see it as a port that generates revenue for that company, rather than a port that could generate revenue that could then be re-invested in the port itself. The fact that it is part of CIÉ and Irish Rail is not ideal but that remains the position at present.

Did the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport nominate himself? Is this a new procedure, whereby Ministers can sit on such committees? What is the purpose of the Minister sitting on the committee? The committee will report, presumably, to the Taoiseach and the Government. Does the Minister not trust what the Government might do with the report? Does he think that it might be binned or shredded and that it might never been seen or does he have particular insights, having been a denizen of the Seanad over many long decades? Is he perhaps out to settle scores? We all heard about a recent episode in the canteen which seemed to be quite colourful and heated in nature, involving a dispute with former allies. Perhaps he has it in for some of the former or current Members of the Seanad. Can the Taoiseach enlighten us on the change in procedures? Does he feel it is helpful that Ministers can now nominate themselves or be nominated to this kind of committee? 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	194	The Taoiseach addressed the Seanad earlier this year on the topic of Seanad reform and suggested that Senators from nationalist and unionist communities in the North should be elected. I note the recent by-election resulted in the election of Senator Ian Marshall, who is from the unionist community. He was elected with the support of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael, and will bring a different perspective to that House. Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, who is from east Belfast, brings a more nationalist North of Ireland perspective to the situation. Both of those Senators were elected in the bizarre and archaic fashion used for the election of Seanadóirí, which we all recognise as something that needs to change. The Manning report recommended that the franchise be extended to all citizens and the diaspora.What are we going to do to make that happen? There is no constitutional impediment to doing so, and the Oireachtas can confer the right to register to vote in Seanad elections to both Irish citizens living in the North and to those holding Irish passports and living abroad. Does the Taoiseach support the recommendations of the Manning report to extend the franchise to citizens in the North and to the diaspora, and will he commit to bringing forward some form of legislation to secure that in the time ahead?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	195	First, it has to be said that when the Fine Gael proposal to abolish the Seanad was defeated, the central reason was the refusal to consider more wide-ranging political reform. It has taken far too long to set up this committee. It is rather bizarre that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, decided to sit on the committee. Some believe it was his last-ditch effort to stop Senator McDowell. I do not know what that is all about, but I think it is unbecoming of him. He needs to focus on his job. He should do something about the second runway in Dublin Airport, the most critical issue in his remit. Meanwhile, he is on every committee, nipping into other ministerial portfolios than his own. On the reform issue, I put it to the Taoiseach that at the commencement of this Dáil we outlined a series of ambitious reforms for this House. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the supports that we are giving the Oireachtas in implementing those reforms. The Parliamentary Budget Office is up and running, but I recall that there was about a year's delay in approving the head of that office, with questions around the level within the public service they were to be accorded and whether they were to be at assistant secretary or deputy secretary general level. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform initially insisted on a principal officer grade for that post. The same concerns apply with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser. It should be an independent office of note in regard to the quality of the people recruited and the level to which they are recruited.  Dáil and Seanad reform will need resources. I ask the Taoiseach to convene a meeting of the party leaders to reflect on the progress we have made since the commencement of this Dáil. For example, there was an offer of assistance in the drafting of Opposition legislation in order to ensure the final measures passed by the House are of a higher quality. The Taoiseach has justified the Government's blocking of legislation from the Opposition on the grounds that he felt it to be poorly drafted. That would not be an issue if there was more comprehensive assistance available as these offices develop and are strengthened.  The programme for Government also promises to evolve better methods of sharing information from Departments with Deputies. In reality, the sharing of information has become much worse. Briefings which were once common have now nearly stopped. Information is now mainly shared via planted stories in newspapers, rather than any accountable forum. Can the Taoiseach outline the proposals he is bringing forward to implement the commitment to being more open in sharing information?  Finally, I note that the Taoiseach recently lectured Ministers about leaking Cabinet information. In a spectacular U-turn from his practices as a Minister, he has decided this is not to be tolerated. Can he say what steps he is taking to find and punish the leakers?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	196	In regard to the size of the committee, I note that it has a maximum membership of 26 but it only has 22 people nominated to it. It does seem like a lot, and it is a lot, but it is actually not much greater than the number of people sitting around the Cabinet table. It may not be as huge as it seems to people, but it is a large number. The reason for that is twofold. First, every group had to have at least one representative, including the Civil Engagement group, the Independent Alliance and the Social Democrat-Green group. We did not think it was appropriate to leave out any group. Once that was done, there also had to be proportionality. Very big groups like Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin should have more members than very small groups. We then get to the figure of 20-something, whether we like it or not. It is not unprecedented. The all-party Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, the all-party Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and the all-party Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution had similar numbers of members and produced good outcomes in a reasonable time period, so I do not think we should underestimate the capacity of people nominated to that committee to deliver the goods. The Independent Alliance has one member, and that member is indeed the Minister, Deputy Ross. As all members of the Independent Alliance are Ministers, I imagine they had no alternative but to appoint a Minister to represent them on that committee. It is an unusual situation for all members of a group to be Ministers, but that is the situation at the moment. Regarding Seanad reform, I very much agree with the proposal to have people in the Seanad who represent the diaspora and Irish citizens overseas. That is done to an extent with Senator Billy Lawless, who has been appointed as a Taoiseach's nominee to the Seanad. However, as they have in France, for example, I would like to see people elected from international constituencies, maybe North America, Europe and so on, representing our citizens overseas. I also very much want to see the voice of Northern Ireland represented in our Seanad. When the Free State Seanad was established, part of its original role was to represent unionist voices. Half of the members of the first Free State Seanad were indeed unionist voices, particularly Southern unionists. I definitely think that our Seanad would add to our Parliament if we had more people from Northern Ireland sitting in it. We have two now, or possibly three; I refer to the recently elected Senator Ian Marshall. However, I think we could have more. That would definitely add to our Parliament, and that is something I very much favour.  The Constitution makes all this very complicated, by the way. People may not be aware of this, but the Constitution requires that Seanad elections are carried out by postal vote. A postal vote involving perhaps a 1 million votes in Northern Ireland is not an easy operation. A postal vote involving millions of votes from all over the world - Irish people are now all over the world - is going to be logistically complicated and very expensive. Perhaps it is not even a good idea, but it would require a constitutional change to avoid it. It is also going to require that we develop a whole new register of electors. Not only would we need to register people in Northern Ireland and people all over the world, but our Constitution requires that people elect to vote on a particular panel. Changing that would require a constitutional amendment. It is not good enough that people are registered to vote; they will have to register to vote and opt to be an elector on a certain panel, and I think that is going to be very confusing for people. The panels that exist were invented in 1930s. They derive from a papal encyclical, the name of which I forget, and they probably do not reflect the way modern society breaks down. This is not going to be a simple reform, for those reasons among others. However, the remit of the committee is not to come up with a new set of proposals. The remit of the committee is to implement the Manning report. This is an implementation group, and I expect that it will help to produce the legislation which we will then put through this House and the other House, allowing the next Seanad or the Seanad after it to be elected according to these new rules. Its terms of reference enable it to come up with alternatives if the committee finds that some of the aspects of the Manning report are impractical. In terms of resources, the Houses are obviously run by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. I imagine the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role in approving. I am not sure how that works, but the Department perhaps has a role in approving particular posts and so on. Perhaps the solution to that is just to give the Oireachtas more autonomy within its own budget to decide at what grade people should be hired. That practice does exist. It is called delegated sanctions.

My Department, as outlined in the strategy statement, provides support services for the Taoiseach and the Government, including the independent Members of Government, through the Government secretariat, the parliamentary liaison unit, the programme for Government office and the Cabinet committee structure to ensure that Government business is managed to the highest standards. The chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the independent Ministers in Government are also based in my Department. The business of the Government is co-ordinated by the Government secretariat. This includes the preparation of the Cabinet agenda, the circulation of papers and the communication of the Government's decisions to the relevant Ministers and Departments.The parliamentary liaison unit was established to help ensure that Ministers and Government Deputies are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The unit provides support to Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business. In performing this function the unit liaises on a regular basis with advisers to the Independent members of Government to ensure they are informed of Oireachtas issues and to assist them in engaging with the new processes arising from Dáil reform. In this regard the parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues. The programme for Government office provides assistance to Government in delivering on its ambitious programme of work through monitoring the implementation of the commitments contained in the programme for Government across all Departments. The office prepares progress reports and an annual report setting out progress made across all of Government in implementing the commitments in the programme. The Cabinet committee system, which is an important part of the machinery of Government and a core part of the work of the Department, provides a whole-of-Government, co-ordinated approach to issues as necessary. The scope of the Cabinet committee system encompasses the Government's national priorities and the challenges Ireland faces in the coming years. The Government press secretary acts as a spokesperson for the Taoiseach and the Government and he is supported by the press office in his role of co-ordinating the media relations of all Departments. The deputy press secretary is also based in my Department and she is tasked with co-ordinating communications for all the Independents in government. My Department continues to adapt and strengthen these supports to ensure they are fully responsive to the requirements arising from Dáil reform and to support effective minority government arrangements.

Does the Minister, Deputy Ross, as the lead Minister with the Independent Alliance get notification and copies of all Cabinet memos and all memos to the Government in advance, as would be the norm with a minority party in government that had a Tánaiste for instance? Can the Taoiseach confirm if he gets advance copies of all the memos, not just the normal notification that Ministers in the Government get? Second, is the Taoiseach thinking of appointing a new deputy Government Whip and can he elaborate on the deal which was done with Deputy Canney? There are a large number of Ministers of State now. The Taoiseach expanded the number of Ministers of State hugely, almost to Bertie Ahern proportions at the last count. A large number of them now have special advisers, due in part to those who are also attending Government. It is the highest ever in the history of the State. We have four now who do not have advisers, so why do some Ministers of State get advisers and others do not? For instance, the Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly, D'Arcy, McEntee, Moran and Halligan, all have advisers, so that would be a cost of roughly €500,000 a year to taxpayers. That is on top of the four Ministers of State who attend Cabinet and their advisers would similarly cost probably another €500,000. Does the Department of the Taoiseach provide supports to Deputies Harty and Lowry? Deputy Lowry in particular always seems to be very well informed of what is happening in terms of Cabinet and Cabinet decisions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	203	I am particularly interested in the question as it relates to the supports provided by the Taoiseach's Department to Ministers of State. The unseemly row between the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, and Deputy Canney did not reflect well on the Government. The image of two individuals tossing a coin at the commencement of the Government to decide who would be Minister of State for one year and who would be Minister of State for the next year and then having a row as to who would be Minister of State for the third year did not reflect well on the Government and should never have been part of the process of appointing Ministers of State in my view. The Taoiseach might outline what supports were provided by him to resolve that dispute. He might also outline if the role of the Minister, Deputy Ross, extends to the Rural Alliance and others because it is very noticeable from time to time in different votes that there are surprising outcomes in terms of support levels. The suspicion remains that deals are being done behind the scenes or accommodations are being arrived at that are not known in the public domain. I have a later question, No. 11, which does not come within the compass of this reply, but does the Minister, Deputy Ross, have an unofficial role in reaching out to some Independents beyond his own immediate group and are certain people in the know? It is accepted that Deputy Lowry is. I agree with Deputy Burton, there is no doubt but that Deputy Lowry is in the loop in terms of Government actions, proposals and announcements and he gets tipped off regularly in advance of other Deputies in Tipperary. That is as a result of a mental telepathy between the Government and Deputy Lowry. I accept what both sides have said that there is no arrangement whatsoever but that they work on a telepathic basis and they have an intuitive understanding that is reciprocated on a regular basis.

This includes Ministers of State playing a more substantive role in policy formation, re-examination of their function within departmental structures and their relationship with Cabinet Ministers. This has not happened to my knowledge but the Taoiseach might enlighten us on what work is happening in this respect. The Department of the Taoiseach has four Ministers of State attached to it. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, works as Government Whip and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is in European affairs. I ask the Taoiseach, in terms of the responsibilities within the Department of the Taoiseach as opposed to their role in other Departments, what the Ministers of State, Deputies Kehoe and Breen, undertake that is specific to the Department of the Taoiseach?

They are put on eCabinet or provided in writing in advance. The exception is if a memo is secret and on occasion there are secret memos or a memo that is commercially sensitive, for example, an IDA grant or contract that is brought to the table or brought underarm as people describe it. That is done on a case-by-case basis. No Minister in the Cabinet has any special entitlement to see things early in a way that would happen in a coalition Government with the leader of the other party. That is not the arrangement. All Ministers get all memos with the exception of a small number that are secret or commercial and a decision is made on a case-by-case basis as to which Ministers may need advance notice and that depends on their individual briefs and responsibilities. As Deputy Canney has resigned as Government assistant Whip, I will appoint a replacement in early course. I just have not had a chance to think about that as of yet.

Previously that function had been carried out by Deputy Canney. There is no written or formal agreement with Deputy Canney but he is continuing to support the Government and we assist him as best we can on a case-by-case basis, as is the case with other Independent Members who support the Government. When it comes to advisers for Ministers of State, that is also done on a case-by-case basis. The Minister of State has to make a request. That request is then considered by me and the Minister for Finance and is approved, if warranted. In some cases, Ministers of State are managing very large budgets. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has a budget of over €1 billion, for example. People can see the level of demand that is on his time. While it gets a lot of criticism, in general the adviser system works well in the Government and it is important to have that intermediary between Ministers and the Civil Service for lots of different reasons.

I hope he will join me in expressing alarm and exasperation at the revelations contained in recent correspondence from the state pathologist in the North of Ireland to the lawyers representing the family of Aidan McAnespie, who was shot dead by a British soldier on 21 February 1988 as he was making his way to his local GAA club grounds at Aughnacloy on the Tyrone-Monaghan border. The letter from Dr. J.R. Lyness advises that while the state pathologist's office has retained seven paraffin tissue blocks containing wax-embedded tissue from some of the major organs of Aidan's body, the section of the ribcage that contained the exit bullet wound had been disposed of. Dr. Lyness states that this disposal was carried out in the years following the post mortem examination but that the state pathologist's office does not hold any records on the disposal of retained tissue from that time. The ribcage section was removed from Aidan's chest cage, adjacent to the breastbone. This ribcage section measured 5 in. by 3 in. and was removed, I understand, at the time of the autopsy carried out by the then deputy state pathologist in the North, Dr. Carson. When Professor Harbison carried out the second autopsy on Aidan's exhumed remains in this jurisdiction, he discovered that this critical section of Aidan's ribcage had been removed. There have been many calls and alleged calls, historically and more recently, to have Aidan's full remains restored to his family, but to no avail. Professor Harbison was unable to make a definitive judgment on the trajectory of the bullet that took Aidan's life. Will the Tánaiste undertake to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, in correspondence and directly when next they meet? Will he request that she establish when Aidan McAnespie's removed ribcage section was disposed of? That no records were allegedly kept is bizarre in itself and is not credible. Will the Tánaiste request that the Secretary of State establish who carried out the disposal and under whose direction it was done? Will he request that she establish in what way the disposal was carried out? Will he request that she establish if the disposed of remains can be retrieved? Will he ask that she secure copies of all relevant documentation, including photographic records of said ribcage section and any other relevant material that the state pathologist's office in Belfast holds?

I extend my sympathy to them. I met the family in March to hear their views and concerns and I subsequently directed my officials to raise the matter with the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland. Given the great public disquiet on both sides of the Border following the shooting, the Government requested that an inquiry be carried out. The then deputy garda commissioner, Mr. Eugene Crowley, was appointed to conduct the inquiry. Deputy Commissioner Crowley's report was submitted to the then Minister for Justice on 8 April 1988. A summary of the report's conclusions and a copy of the report relating to the post mortem carried out by Professor Harbison were provided previously to the McAnespie family. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has provided further copies of these documents to the family’s representatives and is currently examining what options might be available to further assist the family. I have told the family that the Government will stay in contact with them as this progresses. I am aware of the media coverage of the report to which the Deputy refers. This is undoubtedly another extremely difficult time for the family, who have been campaigning for the return of Mr. McAnespie's remains in full. I am sure all Deputies can agree with me that this painful Information must be made all the more distressing by the long time the family have had to wait for it. Dealing with the legacy of the Troubles is complex and a challenging task for everyone. The Government remains fully committed to the framework of measures in the Stormont House Agreement as a means to seek to address the needs of the many victims and survivors and their families and to allow society to move forward from the legacy of the Troubles. Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long already for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland for dealing with legacy issues relating to the Troubles. In this context, I welcomed the launch earlier this month of the UK's public consultation on its draft legislation to implement the legacy aspects of the Stormont House Agreement.These institutions will provide a comprehensive way of addressing the painful legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, in order that victims and survivors can have their legitimate needs and expectations met. I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State. I have urged all with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. On the Deputy's direct questions, we will try to establish the facts surrounding some of the issues the Deputy has outlined. I will ensure the issue is raised with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland.

Is it retrievable or is it irretrievably destroyed? That is unclear from the letter from Dr. Lyness, which, more than 30 years after Aidan's murder at Aughnacloy at the Tyrone-Monaghan border has come as an absolute shock to his family, who have always hoped that that release would inform one of the key and critical issues relating to Aidan's murder. I have itemised several things that I have asked the Minister to pursue with the Secretary of State in respect of the state pathologist's office in the North of Ireland and I also ask the Minister to ask her to include any other possible holders of relevant documentation. I believe there is a bounden responsibility on the Secretary of State to ensure the McAnespie family is fully and absolutely co-operated with, and informed.  The McAnespie family, as well as anyone whom I have heard speak on this latest disturbing information on the murder of Aidan McAnespie, believe that the rib cage section being referred to was removed to cover up the fact that Aidan was hit by a single bullet fired from above and not by a ricochet off the roadway behind him. That view is now confirmed in the minds of many by the revelation that the critical evidence that could attest to the trajectory of the bullet is no longer available to us. Finally, in deference to all that the McAnespie family has sought, I ask the Minister to please intervene with his Cabinet colleagues and request the Minister for Justice and Equality to give effect to the very reasonable request of the entire Committee on Justice and Equality, the McAnespie family and many others, that he contact all those who gave evidence to the then deputy commissioner, Eugene Crowley, in order that they would waive their understanding of confidentiality and allow the report to issue.

I am not sure if it is as straightforward as the Deputy has outlined in terms of simply asking people for their permission to waive confidentiality. The Minister is taking legal advice on it. When an investigation happens on the basis of guarantees around confidentiality, it has a standing that makes dealing with this issue difficult. I have explained that to the McAnespie family and I think they understand where we are coming from. We want to try to be helpful but we do not want to try to build pressure on people who gave evidence on the basis of confidentiality, even all these years later. I will wait to hear what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, thinks may or may not be possible and we have undertaken to communicate with the family on this. It is important to note that I cannot compel the state pathologist in Northern Ireland to provide information one way or the other but I can certainly raise concerns with the Secretary of State. I understand why the Deputy is asking the questions that he has asked. We are currently in a process in Northern Ireland where we are trying to move ahead with a comprehensive, structured response to dealing with legacy issues. There are many families in Northern Ireland from both communities that are trying to deal with very painful memories of murders and atrocities there and I hope that the McAnespie family can, in time, also establish the full truth about what happened to their son. 
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	225	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue, which has been raised in the House many times in recent years. It relates to the inconsistency whereby school bus drivers who reach the age of 70 years are no longer able to transport children to and from schools, although these same bus drivers may transport children from the same school on a school tour to the furthest distance possible, for instance, driving school children on a school tour from Carlow to Donegal and back on the same day. There is no logical reason why the same bus driver may not transport children to and from schools on a route that they probably know better than anyone. It is a contradiction that the school bus driver who knows the area is not in a position to do that. It is ageist that the day he or she turns 70 years, the driver must immediately forfeit that route due to his or her age. Currently, we are encouraging able-bodied people to work longer. We have an ageing population and we will have to work longer. There is a contradiction where someone who is capable, knows the area and the students best and most likely is in a position to look after those children better than anyone else may not do so.  I accept and appreciate that getting children to and from school is a very important chore and that when people are older, there is a requirement for periodic medical certification to ensure they are capable. It is discrimination, however, against people who have reached 70 years. The Minister of State has given the same response to several Deputies. I ask him to consider a situation whereby when a driver reaches 70 years, he or she must undergo a medical test on an annual basis, in order that such drivers will be certified capable of driving the children they know best on the school bus on the routes they know best. It is not too much to ask where we have people who are able. The local school bus route, particularly in rural Ireland, suits a person who is retired who knows the area. Annual testing and certification would allow such people to continue doing the jobs they are capable of doing. This is discrimination which needs to be addressed. Enabling older people to get out in the community is good for their health and mental well-being, particularly when they are arguably better than anyone else to look after children on those routes.  Will the Minister of State review the situation in order that the exclusion of those aged 70 years and over is not set in stone and that there is flexibility for a driver to be able to continue to drive a school bus in a safe manner, once he or she has passed a medical test?
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	226	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I will begin by giving an outline of the extent of the school transport service. School transport is a significant service. At present, more than 116,000 children, including more than 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported by approximately 4,500 vehicles each day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million km annually at a total cost of almost €190 million in 2017.  As the Deputy is aware, Bus Éireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department. It has advised that the minimum age for school bus drivers is 23 years and that candidates must have at least two years' driving experience. In response to the expressed wishes of many school bus drivers - including those employed by Bus Éireann and drivers for private school bus contractors - who wanted to remain in their positions upon reaching retirement age at 66 years, and following the advice of the medical department of Bus Éireann, the company decided to alter the compulsory retirement age for school bus drivers who provide services under the school transport scheme in order to enable experienced personnel to remain in their positions for a maximum of four more years if desired. School bus drivers who opt to remain on after reaching 66 years of age may do so up to the age of 70, if they are satisfied to do so, subject to an annual medical review and once they continue to hold the requisite driving licence. That is the position as it stands. Bus Éireann has further advised that the opinion of its chief medical officer is that, given the demanding and safety-critical nature of school bus driving, 70 is an appropriate age at which to retire from such employment. I accept and understand that because they are living longer, people want to work longer. That is the case in many types of employment. However, we have a huge responsibility when dealing with the general public, particularly children. As far as I know, at present it is not within my remit to make alterations in this regard. The compulsory retirement age is based on the opinion of the chief medical officer. This scheme is directed by Bus Éireann under the auspices of my Department. As the Deputy has suggested, there may be other drivers - and I am not saying there are not, there probably are - who are driving cars. There may also be other bus drivers driving private school transport. Such drivers do not operate under this scheme, however. I receive advice and, as Minister of State with responsibility for the 116,000 children who are transported all around the country every year, I am sometimes obliged to take the advice of the chief medical officer. Right now, that is the advice he has given me. I have no problem going back to the chief medical officer and asking him again to give me the substantial medical reasons as to why he reached that decision and to tell me when he reached that decision. I may be wrong, but I believe it was in 2001.

I very much appreciate that the school bus service is a very important and integral part of rural Ireland. We know that there have been issues around it in recent years and I thank the Minister of State for his engagement in that regard and for bringing the issues to a reasonable conclusion. With regard to the substantive issue, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I appreciate how demanding and responsible the job is. Over a number of years, we have seen some fatalities with regard to school buses. It is important that my child, the Minister of State's child or anybody else's child gets to his or her destination safe and sound and gets home in the evening in the very same way once the school day is over. The substantive issue with regard to the point I made is that we have an aging population. There are now people who are capable of working longer and who want to do so. They should be given the opportunity to work longer and should not be discriminated against. I met a couple of bus drivers in my area in Carlow in recent weeks. One individual had been driving buses all his life. Previously, he had been a lorry driver for Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann. He is very used to driving around the country. He has been discriminated against. He drives for a local bus company and has taken kids on their school tour from a rural part of Carlow to Cork for the day. That is approximately 240 miles to 250 miles. At the same time, he is not allowed to bring the school kids on the school route, which would only be about 15 miles or 20 miles, on a daily basis. I would appreciate it if, as he suggested, the Minister of State went back to the chief medical officer and asked him the criteria and rationale behind what he has suggested. If there was some flexibility in that regard, it would be very useful for everybody.

Obviously, I recognise that he is concerned with the safety and health of the 116,000 children, including 12,000 with special needs, who are transported around the country every year, sometimes in poor conditions. I accept that. When somebody is driving and has responsibility for the general public - particularly for schoolchildren and so on - the Department, Bus Éireann and I, as Minister of State, have a critical responsibility to review all medical evidence available and to be careful in every decision we make. There are criteria laid down for all drivers. I will not go through them today because they are not relevant to this particular question. However, the medical officer said that, given the demanding and safety-critical nature of the job, he deemed 70 an appropriate age. However, as I have told the Deputy, I will go back to the medical officer and ask him the criteria which were laid down and when the decision was made. I have no problem doing that. Now that I think of it, I was correct. That decision was made in 2001. Perhaps it needs to be looked at. I cannot say that in my capacity as Minister of State, however. I am obliged to take on board what the chief medical officer appointed by Bus Éireann says as it is in control of the service. I will certainly revert to the Deputy when I have spoken to the chief medical officer.

I raised it already this morning during questions on promised legislation. I did not realise at that time that my Topical Issue matter had been selected. The basic issue relates to an individual in my constituency who is in receipt of €229 in family income supplement, which is a substantial enough payment in its own right. It recognises the particular circumstances of my constituent. He has a wife. He is working, she is a full-time homemaker and they have seven children. In recognition of the need to meet their weekly outgoings, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection deems it necessary to pay them the family income supplement, which is very welcome. It is a very good and fair scheme and is reflective of the need in which families find themselves and of the support they need. Long may it continue. The eldest child of that same family is sitting his leaving certificate this year and will be going to third level next year. He applied for a third-level grant and failed to get it on the basis that the family's income exceeds the threshold. This is an anomaly and it must be corrected. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection deems it necessary to pay this family income support in order to meet its basic requirements. This is a family that will pay its mortgage, its household tax, its property tax and VAT on everything it buys. These people are contributing to society in every way. They are now trying to educate their family. They have started with their eldest son but cannot get a grant for higher education. This is an anomaly which must be corrected. I am not asking the Minister of State to come back with a review and an overhaul of the system. We can talk about such things at all times. Education grants are always to be reviewed. However, in these particular circumstances - and I would imagine that there are not too many people in this situation as we speak - if a family is in receipt of the family income supplement, there should be an automatic entitlement to a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. I ask the Minister of State to rectify this matter by ministerial order or any other method that might be required. I ask that she does not put the family or the student under any further stress. To use a common term, this is a no-brainer. It is something which should be dealt with and needs to be dealt with. I know the Minister of State to be a person of practicality and fairness.I ask her to use that practicality and fairness and simply intervene to resolve this issue immediately.

I acknowledge he raised it earlier today with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the Order of Business. As the Deputy knows, under the terms of the student grant scheme, assistance is awarded to students who meet the conditions on funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. The assessment of means under the student grant scheme is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion that might arise from different spending decisions. The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service payments excluded. The income limits for grant eligibility are increased relative to the number of students in a family applying for a grant. Also, in recognition of the additional cost to parents where more than one person is attending college, an increment for each additional relevant person can be applied to the income thresholds at the rates outlined in the student grant scheme documentation. The maximum increment that can be applied for each additional family member attending college at the same time is €4,830. In this way, the student grant scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families. The eligibility of an applicant or the level of the grant awarded may be reassessed by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year. The applicant should, in the first instance, contact SUSI and notify it of the change in circumstances. The Deputy will be aware that the family income supplement provides an income support for employees on low earnings with families. The family income supplement was recently renamed and it is now known as the working family payment, WFP. Under the student grant scheme, the WFP is treated as an income disregard in the means assessment process. It is also included as an eligible payment for the special rate of maintenance grant. In recognition of the fact that the working family payment is paid to a family as opposed to an individual, a change was made to the 2016 SUSI grant scheme to recognise the presence of a payment even in cases where it is paid to a person whose income is not assessed as part of the means assessment process. I do not really want to talk about the family in question but the highest income limit for a family of the size the Deputy is talking about is €59,595. I have been advised that the income of the family in question is above this threshold. Therefore, the applicant will not qualify for grant support.

I will continue to pursue this matter. The working family payment is basically a recognition by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that, education aside, the family needs extra money in order to meet minimum living standards. As a State, we are saying the family in question does not qualify for support to educate its child. It simply does not stack up. I am aware of the application process and guidelines. We can have another debate on the very low grant rates and the fact that, for any working family, trying to get support to educate its children is next to impossible but what is occurring beggars belief considering that the State itself recognises it has to intervene and pay a working family payment to a family so it will reach a basic standard of living. The last line of the Minister of State's reply is that the applicant will not qualify for grant support. I must, therefore, go back to the working family and tell the husband and wife, who have seven children, that the State will help them to reach the minimum standard of living but will not help them to educate their child. What does that say about us as a nation? If we cannot educate and support our young people, where are we going as a nation? I will not let this issue go because it needs to be resolved. If there are other families caught up in the same circumstances, their cases need to be sorted out and they need to be supported. The Minister of State's reply is just not good enough.

As of now, the highest income limit for a family of the size in question is €59,595. If a family's income exceeds this threshold – these are the rules I have — the applicant will not qualify for the grant support. The scheme is being reviewed, however.

I appreciate it very much. A top consultant turned whistleblower at University Hospital Kerry has told the newspaper Kerry's Eye that the lives of public patients are now at serious risk because of vital scans being delayed. Consultant radiologist Dr. Martin Schranz has said public patients with potentially life-threatening illnesses are facing serious health risks because of delays in assigning them a patient number that will allow them to have a scan at the hospital. He said that when a patient is referred to the hospital for a scan, he or she has to be assigned a number by the clerical staff in the hospital before he or she can be scanned. He said he knows of five patients whose treatments have been delayed in the past five years. The latest case was in the past five months and involved a cancer patient who was awaiting a scan so he could be operated on in Cork. By the time he had the scan, which was weeks later because he was waiting for the number, he formed a complication, which may or may not have existed beforehand. That is where the delay has occurred. Dr. Schranz said a GP can ring and say he is worried about a patient and that he has only one option, that is, to send the patient to the emergency department. The consultant says he cannot scan the patient because he does not have a number. It could take a couple of weeks or up to three months. He said one never knows when one can get that number. If the patients pay, they get the number the same day but those who cannot afford it do not get the scan. One does not know who is serious and who is not. The consultant claims GPs are worried enough to ring him but that his back is against the wall. What can he say to the patient? Does he say he cannot scan the patient unless he or she pays, or does he apologise and say he or she must go to the emergency department and wait six or seven hours just to get the scan? Dr. Schranz says this has been going on since the manual system at the hospital was digitised four years ago. It can take months to get a number, if one gets a number at all, but the average waiting time is about four weeks.It is a simple matter but it means patients who could have cancer, appendicitis or another urgent or semi-urgent condition are not scanned for weeks or months. Dr. Schranz filled up incident forms that the hospital should take seriously and investigate but he has heard nothing back. He says the delays are seriously impeding him from doing his job. That is not right for patients and it is not right for general practitioners, GPs, who are very frustrated. Dr. Schranz said that a colleague of his in the emergency department cannot understand why their department is being bogged down with these patients. Most of these matters turn out to be normal but potentially they could result in life or death situations. I will put three questions first to the Minister of State. First, has he or the Department ever been made aware of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz at University Hospital Kerry, UHK? If so, when were they made aware and what action was taken? Second, does the Minister of State accept the claims made by Dr. Schranz and the concerns raised about the delays regarding scans at University Hospital Kerry? Third, is he aware that UHK, through its public relations, PR, consultants, Heneghan PR, categorically stated in writing that the hospital does not accept what Dr. Martin Schranz is stating and has no knowledge of the incidents he alleges? I have a number of other questions that I will ask after the Minister of State has replied.

I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, who apologises that he could not be here. The Minister acknowledges that, in general, waiting times are often unacceptably long and he is conscious of the burden that places on patients and their families. However, it is important to note that in regard to the prioritisation used when scheduling patients for appointments, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has adopted a national waiting list management policy, which sets out the processes hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. This policy was developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. I understand Deputy Healy-Rae has specific concerns about delays in the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry. It is important to note that all staff in our hospitals are aware of the strict protocols relating to patient safety incidents. All safety incidents, both clinical and non-clinical, must be notified through the process outlined in the HSE’s safety incident management policy. I would like to assure the Deputy that the Minister for Health has been advised by the HSE that the hospital has not received any safety incident forms relating to ultrasound scan delays in University Hospital Kerry. The Minister has been further advised that management in UHK has been working with radiologists in the hospital to develop a pathway to assign patients for scans in a manner that is consistent with HSE protocols relating to fair and equitable access to treatment for public and private patients based on patient acuity. A transparent, fair and equitable pathway has also been developed for GP referrals for ultrasound scans which are non-urgent and routine, and for urgent cases which are dealt with through the emergency department or acute medical assessment unit, AMU, if required.  The Deputy may also wish to note that, following a recommendation in Sláintecare, the Minister has established an independent review group, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system. The group has been asked to conclude its work and report to the Minister in September 2018. In regard to the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry, I wish to conclude by reassuring the Deputy that the HSE has confirmed that the management at the hospital has not received any safety incident forms relating to ultrasound scan delays and that it is satisfied that patients are assigned for scans in a manner consistent with HSE protocols on fair and equitable access to treatment.

Can he assure hundreds of public patients, including cancer patients, that the scan delays issue raised by Dr. Schranz has not resulted in missed diagnosis or delayed treatment that has adversely affected an existing diagnosis? Can he assure patients that their health and welfare is not compromised because of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz? Can he confirm that, regarding the radiology department at UHK, private patients are being block-booked for scans assigned to protect public patient slots? Is this the first time the Minister has become aware of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz? What does he propose to do about it? Having said all that, it is only right to acknowledge the work that has been carried out by management on the public-private issue I have raised in recent months about which I have concerns. My overall concern is to ensure that the HSE does not allow University Hospital Kerry to be downgraded by stealth, in other words, by not allocating adequate resources to the hospital. I do not want to see our hospital in Tralee, in County Kerry, downgraded and left to be nothing more than a glorified community hospital. The people of Kerry deserve better. We deserve to have a properly run and adequately resourced hospital. We have great people working in the hospital, including management, doctors and nurses who are diligent in their duty. I want them to be given adequate resources to run an excellent hospital.

I will bring the concerns he raised to the Minister, Deputy Harris, as well as the particular points he raised in respect of Dr. Schranz. In regard to investment in the health services, they will not be downgraded by stealth; there is no question of that. We have invested a great deal of money in the health services. We will deal with these issues as part of the reform agenda because we accept that we need to reform and invest in health services. On the particular questions asked, it is important that we accept the following three points, which are very important. First, the UHK operations manager has engaged directly with the consultant radiologist about his concerns. Second, UHK has advised that it has developed a clear pathway for GP referrals for ultrasound scans which is transparent, fair, equitable and consistent with HSE protocols relating to fair and equitable access for public and private patients. Third, the UHK management has advised that the hospital has not received any safety incident forms regarding the ultrasound scan delays in the hospital. It also advises that none of its other radiologists have raised any concerns in that regard. That is important. I will bring the other issues raised by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris. We will follow up on them and revert to the Deputy with a more detailed response.

No. 89 of 2018) be and are hereby annulled.It might be necessary to reaffirm my party's position for the Minister because the perception is being put about that we have a different agenda. Our agenda is that we do not oppose the introduction of the penalty points system, provided the system is fair and balanced. That is not the position as it was in the 2014, the 2016 or the 2018 statutory instrument.The system that is being introduced must protect the rights of the individuals and respect and incorporate the previous judgments of the court. I will deal with those later if I have time. This is the Government's third attempt. Previous attempts have failed. I will not necessarily refer to the Supreme Court unless I do so in my reply later on. Time has been wasted. We are told that the clock has almost stopped and that we will have difficulties with Europe. What has been happening since 2014? While the Minister might say there has been consultation and engagement, there has been little or no consultation or engagement. Indeed, we have always been available to meet and have raised this by way of oral and written questions and correspondence between the Minister and I. We are here today because there has been no engagement with me or very little engagement with the sector except in the margins of meetings held in the past.  I will zone in on six fundamental points. Section 5 refers to the determination panel while section 11 refers to the appeals officer. The statutory instrument states that the determination panel and the appeals officer if such is the case would determine on the balance of probabilities. We do not accept this principle of a lesser burden of proof. It is grossly unfair to the individual to lower the burden of proof. We will be proposing a statutory instrument we have prepared under which, in both instances, the case must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt in line with common law principles. Anything less is not in keeping with our common law system. We speak about an administrative system as opposed to the judicial system to which we are accustomed.  Fishermen and fishing vessel owners should have the right to appeal to the High Court after this is dealt with by the determination panel and the appeals officer. The current position open to them under the statutory instrument is grossly inadequate. Basically, appeals can only be made on a point of law as per the Government or Minister's statutory instrument. A full right of appeal must be available to the individual. This is the most basic point of our common law in line with the UK and Malta. We talk about an administrative system as opposed to a judicial system to which we are accustomed. The current process, as outlined in the statutory instrument, is inadequate in respect of the rights of the individuals.  Another substantial point concerns the role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, as outlined in the statutory instrument. It overlaps on different occasions between a detection function, which is the authority's statutory role, and one where it adjudicates, which is not its role. We are most concerned that this statutory instrument, as presented, does not put clear water between defining the independence of the determination panel and the appeals office beyond reasonable doubt. To put it in simple language, the proposed structure under this statutory instrument would be similar to An Garda Síochána detecting an infringement, being allowed to select the judges to adjudicate on the case and finally handing down the eventual judgment. These are three parts that should and must remain independent but are clearly not. The SFPA has three roles and a domineering role in the process directly and indirectly. I must admit that in the Minister's correspondence to me on 17 May, he referred to the administrative role of the SFPA but upon examining SI No. 89/2018, the role defined by this legislation for the SFPA is far more than administrative. I refer the Minister to section 5(10)(a), section 5(10)(b)(i) and section 5(10)(b)(ii) under which the SFPA has the authority to remove a member of the determination panel from office. This is hardly an administrative function by any stretch of the imagination.  I will now refer to the issue of penalty points. The Department eventually admitted that we have serious issues surrounding the multiplication of penalty points when sales of tonnage occur in more than one part. If someone decides to sell their vessel or is decommissioning it, the vessel has a capacity of 100 tonnes and the owner has three penalty points, if one breaks down selling the tonnage of 20 tonnes each to five different individuals, every one of those individuals carries those three penalty points or whatever number of penalty points are attached to it. This multiplier effect is still there despite what the Minister has said. Points can only be applied to capacity once and there should be no multiplier within the EU directive. Penalty points should be deleted when the case is taken to the High Court and is successful. I reference the point I made earlier whereby an individual must have the right to appeal to the High Court.  The timescales outlined in the statutory instrument are completely unrealistic in terms of fishermen's work schedules. We must realise that fishermen are at sea. They could be in the Porcupine Bank, off the north west of Scotland or west of four degrees east, where, fortunately, until now, they could fish mackerel. Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to debate Brexit. They could be there but how many days are they given? They are given ten days to appeal to the determination panel for an oral hearing. This does not make sense. The period of ten days allowed for making written submissions to the Department is not acceptable. These timeframes are completely unrealistic in the context of the lifestyles of our fishermen at sea. We are proposing that both of these timescales be extended to 30 days.  Under section 12(6), someone only gets five days to provide additional information. This should be changed to 20 days. Many fishermen are at sea during fishing season as opposed to doing paperwork in offices. We are of the belief that when requested by an individual, an oral hearing should be granted to them.  This matter cannot be forced on fishermen or the fishing sector. I am not here representing the large vessels, as has been said by Government and Government representatives. This pertains to all vessels, small and large, if there is an infringement. To peddle the story that we are only interested in the larger boats is very unfair. The Government has circumvented me and talked to others about it. The Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, is from Donegal. He is a Deputy when he is in Donegal and Chief Whip when he is in Donegal. Those of us in Donegal are telling him that we cannot understand why the Minister is doing this. It does not make sense. It is a case of speaking with forked tongues but that is nothing new for the Minister of State. I am disappointed he is not here today in his capacity as a Deputy from Donegal to defend the rights of these individuals but, of course, that is the way some of these people operate. Worse still, blaming officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for this, and the Government is not really that anxious to do it, is wrong. If we are really serious about something, the Minister carries the can. If we support the Government, we will support it and not speak with forked tongues.  However much they might know about fisheries, a spokesman for the Government is reported to have said in a newspaper today that we did not engage. We have engaged and we have consulted. We have a statutory instrument ready to hand over and circulate that I believe will accord with the Supreme Court ruling. I have worked closely with all of these in respect of this. We have that draft statutory instrument ready. When I look at the Supreme Court ruling, and the Minister might refer to paragraphs 47, 51 and 52 of the Supreme Court ruling when he responds, it shows very clearly that the last statutory instrument did not comply and I am quite satisfied that this one will not comply either. I look forward to hearing from the Minister but I can tell him that he has a party on this side of the House that fully supports the principle of this but it must be fair, equitable and balanced. We are ready to engage with the Minister after this statutory instrument is rescinded.

I know he has been liaising consistently with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister to try to find a more satisfactory outcome that meets the needs of all concerned. We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector. We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again. The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor. Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore. As Deputy Gallagher outlined, we recognise the need to introduce a penalty-points system but it needs to be fair and proportionate. Too often the fishing sector has been in adversarial mode with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister, which must change. We need to have proper consultation and engagement, involving, if possible, a partnership approach with the stakeholders involved. Deputy Gallagher has been very much to the fore in trying to achieve an outcome that addresses the concerns while complying with the regulations. The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof. The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued. The role of the SFPA permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments. The multiplication of points and tonnage is logical. If five penalty points are associated with a certain level of tonnage and that tonnage is sold in three lots, the full five points should apply to each of the three lots, rather than being applied proportionately with the level of tonnage involved. We also need to address the issue of the timeline involved in appeals and the right to an oral hearing. It is time for the Minister to engage further with Opposition parties and Deputy Gallagher, as fisheries spokesperson for our party, to try to find an outcome that will be acceptable to all while meeting the needs and obligations of the State. In order to do that, the Minister should withdraw this statutory instrument and take on board the concerns expressed, make the amendments suggested by Fianna Fáil and issue a statutory instrument that better meets the needs of the sector while ensuring we are compliant with our obligations.

If we, as a Parliament, did not scrutinise this statutory instrument, the third statutory instrument in a series, we would be accused of being grossly derelict in our duties. However, when we did so, all we got were briefings from the Department that my party was endangering the country's future and would bring all sorts of fines down upon us. How much was spent on fighting cases in the Supreme Court over the previous two statutory instruments that were struck down which led us to this situation? How much time was spent trying to get to this statutory instrument, which should have been spent on engagement with Deputy Gallagher and the industry in an attempt to resolve the situation before it came to this? We have until Tuesday for the Minister to lay out some sort of pathway to resolve this, taking into account the very fair issues outlined by Deputy Gallagher regarding the burden of proof, the rights of appeal, penalty points capacity and some sort of realistic appeals timeframe, bearing in mind the people we are dealing with, the pressure on their time and the fact that this is not a desk job. Being a fisherman is the furthest from a desk job imaginable. Their ability to respond to appeals or to charges needs to be factored in. Some reports have indicated that the Attorney General, who is quite in the news at the moment, expressed some concerns about this new penalty-points regime at the end of March. Given that he has already referred to one item of legislation going through this House as a "dog's dinner", I am not quite sure what term he would use for this. Maybe there should be some sort of liaison with his concerns brought to the Opposition's attention so that we could all find a collective arrangement to deal with those concerns. While it is good that the Minister, Deputy Creed, is taking responsibility for marine issues and is bringing them to the Cabinet table, he needs backup. He has justifiably spent a huge amount of time travelling abroad establishing new markets for beef and fish. However, issues such as this are being left to the last minute in this kind of manner. Consideration should be given to having a Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, as Deputy Gallagher had some time ago, in order that these issues do not arise at the last minute. Many of our smaller fishing communities feel completely alienated from the work of this House and the European Union. They feel they have paid the price of Ireland's membership of the European Union since we acceded to the European Economic Community in 1973. We need to use our collective imagination as representatives, and as policymakers and use the new opportunities that are there in terms of Brexit but also in terms of other issues, such as our response to climate change and tourism, to respond to that alienation and to tell our small fishing communities that they have a viable future and that we respect their right to play a part in this Republic. That sense of alienation is getting deeper. Many of these communities are dying on their feet. The way this issue has been handled is adding to the sense that marine issues are not a priority, not just for the Government but for the central government system full stop. If we deal with this collectively as an Oireachtas and deal with it in a progressive way working together, we can start addressing these issues and lay some sort of pathway to addressing that alienation.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	240	I thank Deputy Gallagher and the other Deputies concerned for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on certain matters relating to the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018, SI 89 of 2018. Nine years ago, following a European Court of Auditors review of the enforcement of fisheries law, it was agreed by Ministers at EU level that a minority of vessels were not respecting the rules and were, through reckless overfishing, endangering the long-term sustainability of fish stocks on which all fishermen rely. After much debate, the 2009 EU control regulation was agreed by the Council of Ministers. The deadline for its introduction in member states was 1 January 2012, more than six years ago.  The control regulation provided for a points system for serious infringements targeted primarily at the licence and therefore the licenceholder. The primary purpose was to try to ensure a level playing field for those fishermen who were respecting the rules. The new EU points system is designed to complement and not replace national sanctions and ensure a level playing field across the EU.  This regulation requires effective and dissuasive sanctions complemented by a points system for serious infringements. Serious infringements are activities that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks. They include landing illegal "black" fish, not accurately declaring what was caught, falsification of records, concealing, tampering with or disposal of evidence and obstructing officials carrying out an investigation. Crucially, this EU points system is applicable to all fishing vessels that fish in the Irish 200-mile zone, both Irish and foreign. Ireland introduced the EU points system for licenceholders in 2014, by way of secondary legislation, SI 3 of 2014. It operated for a period but, as the Deputies have pointed out, it was challenged successfully in two cases by licenceholders who had been assigned points for serious infringements. The High Court judgments were appealed to the Supreme Court, which examined the provisions of the 2014 statutory instrument. One of the key issues was that points should only be assigned following conviction in the courts. The Supreme Court judgment of Mr. Justice O'Donnell states, "In my view it is clear that such a system of points allocation [that is, the stand-alone system] is permissible under European Regulations." The Supreme Court judgment found that it is permissible to have a stand-alone points system pursuant to a statutory instrument so as to enable timely and effective implementation of the EU points system for sea fishing boat licenceholders. The Supreme Court stated:The possibility of points being allocated to a licence and remaining on that licence even after transfer, is likely to add to the dissuasive effect of the regime for enforcement of fishing rules. The possibility of points being allocated even before criminal proceedings are completed, or even though the outcome of the criminal proceedings may be an acquittal, is not a reason to conclude that the stand alone system is incompatible with the European Regulations since that outcome will, if anything, increase the possibility of enforcement of the rules, and in dissuading operators and licence holders from permitting breach of them. A stand alone system of points allocation certainly does not weaken enforcement. It can also be truly said to be complementary to the existing enforcement regime since it enhances enforcement and therefore compliance. In my view it is clear that such a system of points allocation is permissible under the European Regulations. The Supreme Court found that the 2014 statutory instrument procedures were not adequate. That statutory instrument set up, in effect, a single decision-making process with the onus of disproof on the licenceholder and did not comply with fair procedures. This is addressed in the current statutory instrument we are discussing. It reverses the onus on the licenceholder contained in the 2014 statutory instrument and places the burden of proof on the control authorities. It provides for the separation of the detection of a serious infringement by the control authorities and the determination by an independent determination panel of whether, on the balance of probabilities, a serious infringement has occurred. The determination panel now comprises three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General. The licenceholder may request an oral hearing of the case. The SFPA provides a purely supportive administrative role, appointing the Attorney General's nominated professionals and providing all reasonable facilities and services to the panel. These practical services do not cut across the independence of the determination panel. This 2018 statutory instrument provides for an independent appeals officer to review the decision of the determination panel and he or she may, at his or her discretion, decide to conduct an oral hearing. The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea-fishing boat licence for periods from two months to one year. In extreme cases, persistent serial and serious fisheries infringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of a licence. Deputies will be aware that, on 17 May 2018, the European Commission issued a letter of formal notice against Ireland for non-compliance with the required EU points system for licence holders of sea-fishing boats and a separate system for skippers of vessels. It has given Ireland two months to submit observations before deciding if it will proceed to pursue the infringement with the European Court. There are also serious financial implications with regard to the EU co-funding of Ireland’s EMFF operational programme. The EU is committed to contributing €37.2 million towards the €44.5 million cost of EMFF control investments. This EU contribution represents 83.6% of these costs. The Commission is withholding payment of these moneys and is moving to formally suspend payment. To date, a €2.7 million claim has been withheld and a further €4 million claim is about to be suspended. Ultimately, Ireland will lose the entire €37 million unless we fully comply with these legal requirements. This is the stark reality of what may happen should this House vote to annul SI 89 of 2018. The points system is necessary as an effective measure against the minority - foreign or Irish - who break the rules. It is necessary to protect the vast majority of our law-abiding industry and preserve the fish stocks for all fishermen and for future generations. That is a good enough reason to support this statutory instrument; the danger of jeopardising almost €40 million in EU funding by playing to the gallery is another. The majority of fishermen in this country want to see points applied to those who commit serious infringements, jeopardising the future for everyone. A vote to annul this statutory instrument would be a vote for that small minority of serious offenders who want to act with impunity. I urge the House to protect the future of our fishing industry and to reject the motion.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	243	I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after “hereby annulled”:“and calls on the Government to introduce regulations that will provide redress to the courts in circumstances where the complainant is not satisfied with a sanction made under the regulations, in order to give effect to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Ireland on this matter.”I thank Deputy Gallagher for putting forward the motion. The issue, which has been around for some time, concerns penalty points for fishermen. It is important to state that it is appropriate that penalty points would be applied to fishermen who are in breach of the rules. Everyone agrees with that and we need to see it happen. We want to see a statutory instrument which can bring that into effect in a way that is measured and that works for everyone involved in the industry, including fishermen. The document which has been produced contains many parts that we take issue with. In the first few pages, one of the first things we come across is the issue of proof and the fact that this will be based on the "balance of probabilities". This is one of the fundamental issues for most people. We deal all the time with individuals who are in some way slightly on the wrong side of regulations. Many fear that, at times, they could be treated badly if they have a past record and may have breached a rule such that each time they start over, it could be held against them and they might not be treated as fairly as if it was their first time to be outside a regulation. Many people would have an issue with that and it is where the problem with the balance of probability arises. The balance of probability is a very loose way of looking at this and it needs to be re-examined. There is also the question of the independence of the determination panel because it is so closely linked to the SFPA which is a problem for some. Ultimately, the decision as to whether there is a serious breach is going to be in the report that comes from the SFPA and that report comes to the determination panel, which is made up of three members who are appointed by the SFPA. There are questions to be asked and it is only fair that the Minister uses this opportunity to clarify the situation. Another issue that alarms me concerns the oral hearings. The document, on page 6, states, "The Determination Panel, having regard to the interest of justice, may decide at its discretion, whether or not to conduct an oral hearing for the purposes of the determination." Many of us deal with the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and sections where there are meetings and a requirement to go before determination panels to sort out issues. In all cases, there is an automatic right to have an oral hearing and the fishermen can go in to make their case. It would be more than appropriate that this is looked at again to ensure they can make their case and that the oral hearing is acceded to in all cases. Deputy Gallagher referred to the timeframe of ten working days. To make a request for a hearing within ten days is too tight a timeframe and I believe it needs to be broadened out considerably in the interests of fair play for everybody involved. Other issues that jump straight out include the period relating to appeals. The period allowed to make an appeal under the regulation, at 20 working days, is too short. There needs to be a recognition that we are dealing with fishermen who are out at sea much of the time and we need to find a way of dealing with these issues. There is also the question of criminal proceedings and what role the courts might have, an issue to which we refer directly in our amendment. There is a feeling, from the fisherman's point of view, that if all else fails, they can go to the court, have a proper hearing and put their case, particularly if they cannot put it anywhere else. If they are refused an oral hearing, however, and the determination panel and the appeals office find against them, where have they to go? They have nowhere to go.That is the issue. They need to know that in the interests of fair play, they can go to court, put their case and have it heard. At least they then will feel there is a sense of fair play. At present, the fishermen to whom I have spoken, and they are all around the country, are of the same view, that is, that the odds are stacked against them. If we wanted to do this fairly we would make sure to represent the fisherman first. We understand there is an obligation under EU regulations but the first port of call is to ensure the fisherman is looked after in all of these cases. The only place we see anything about this is where it states that criminal proceedings are not valid. It states "points assigned to a holder of an Irish licence remain assigned regardless of any criminal proceedings pending, or the outcome of any such proceedings, in respect of the serious infringement concerned." This is a draconian way of dealing with an industry that is on its knees and needs help. This is an opportunity for the Minister to rectify that by withdrawing the statutory instrument and it is in the interests of fair play that he find a solution that works for everyone. The statutory instrument also states that an appeal may be made to the appeals office not later than 20 working days from the day of notification of the proposal by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to assign the points to the fisherman. Again, 20 days is too short a timeframe in which to get it done and this provision needs to be looked at again. It states the appeals officer may decide, at his or her discretion, whether to conduct an oral hearing. Again, there needs to be a sense of fair play here. All people are looking for is the sense that common justice will apply. It goes on to state:The Appeals Officer shall confirm that the points shall be assigned to the holder of the licence where on the balance of probabilities, he or she considers that the alleged serious infringement in respect of which it is proposed to assign points—(a) did occur,and occurred according to the regulations. The fishers who are doing their best, who want to and are playing by the rules fear that if they make a mistake, they will be dragged over the coals and made an example of. That is not fair. I do not know who wrote the statutory instruments or where they came from but it seems what we have now is a copy-and-paste job, with a few little changes, of what was rejected by the Supreme Court. That is the issue. We need to come up with something that looks after the people out at sea who are trying to get their livelihood from this industry, which is under pressure so much of the time. The statutory instrument also states a person may appeal to the High Court on a point of law only. If it is not only on a point of law it is only on the process. People need to be able to go to court on the overall problem they have encountered and to have their full case heard and they need to know they will get fair play. If that is not going to happen, the statutory instrument is not up to what we need.

Ní seo an céad uair atá iarraithe ag an Rialtas é seo a dhéanamh ach mar atá a fhios againn agus mar atá sé ráite ag an Teachta Martin Kenny agus na cainteoirí roimhe seo, bhí ar na cúirte bogadh isteach an uair deireanach agus a rá nach raibh an rud a bhí á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas bunreachtúil. Fad agus a táimid ag plé cúrsaí bunreachta, le tamaill anuas, léiríonn sé an tuiscint atá taobh istigh den Roinn agus an Rialtas ó thaobh go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur leasú dá reachtaíocht chun tosaigh ar an dara lámh tríd an statutory instrument ina raibh na cúirteanna ag rá nach raibh sé dlíthiúil. Penalty points for fishing offences have long been an issue of controversy and that has been caused in no small part by the Government and its arrogance and utter disregard for fishermen, their industry and the courts. In March 2016, I was proud to table a motion in this House on a statutory instrument signed by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney. He was attempting to impose a penalty points system at that time but it was struck out. It was the very same statutory instrument, seeking to reintroduce a points-based system, which the High Court had found to be unconstitutional as it operated under the assumption of guilt. It says a lot about the mentality of the Government and the Department, and of the way they see fishermen, that they brought forward a statutory instrument in this way and which our courts found did not meet the criteria in the Constitution. In ainneoin breith na cúirte, tá páirtí an Aire chun an reachtaíocht seo a shíniú ar aon nós. Mar sin sháraigh sé ceartaí iascairí agus na cúirteanna fosta agus bhí tús áite tugtha ar polasaí an Rialtais thar achan nith eile. Sin an fadhb mhór atá anseo, go bhfuil an tús áite sin tugtha do pholasaí an Rialtais in áit tús áite a bheith á thabhairt do iascaraí atá ag obair agus ag iarraidh a bheith i mbun a slí beatha. Sinn Féin is not opposed to a system of penalty points for fishing offences in accordance with our obligations under European regulations but any such system must be fair and equitable. They are the key test for all of this. The system must respect the individual rights of fishermen and must not unfairly impact on their livelihoods and those of fishing crews. It must be a regime which allows for natural justice to occur and to be seen to occur and must, therefore, allow for recourse to the justice system. That is the test my party has to a system that is to be introduced or is before us, such as the one we are debating this evening. This statutory instrument, unfortunately, fails these tests and that is why it needs to be rescinded. It is beyond comprehension that any proposed regime would not allow redress in the courts in circumstances where a complainant is not satisfied with the sanction imposed under the regulations. Deputy Martin Kenny spoke at length on the restrictions on one's ability to take a case to the High Court, such as the provision that it must be on a point of law. It is my party's view that such a provision is needed to give effect to the ruling of the Supreme Court on this matter and to deliver a system which is fair to all who are subject to it. I am in a privileged position to represent the constituency and the people of Donegal, in which there are many fishing communities. I know only too well the challenges and the hardship that many of those involved in the fishing industry face daily. The idea that a Government would seek to introduce a penalty points system that is not only unjust but is punitive and discriminates against fishermen is not surprising, given its track record on the matter, but it is nevertheless shameful and unforgivable. Mar sin, tugann Sinn Féin ár dtacaíocht don rún seo atá os comhair an Tí inniu agus molaimid go ligfidh gach Teachta Dála don rún seo rith tríd an Teach fosta. For too long our fishing communities have been let down by successive Governments. Indeed, they have been abandoned and criminalised by the powers that be. I ask all Deputies to show that Members of this House hear their concerns, support them and support their right to pursue their livelihoods without fear or favour. That is why we need to rescind this statutory instrument.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	245	I am glad to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Labour Party, to contribute to this debate, which centres on the implementation of SI 89 of 2018, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations, which appears to supersede SI 125 of 2016 which was signed into law on 1 March 2016 by the predecessor of the current Minister. There has been a significant amount of debate on this issue and the Minister has put forward his views on putting in place a system that derives from the Common Fisheries Policy and the application of an EU regulation from eight or nine years ago.I find it astounding that we have reached this impasse now. At the last hour we are putting in place a penalty points system that appears to be permitted under the EU regulations. The critical issue lies with the format in which it is going to be implemented in this country. There are a number of issues, but it is important to implement this. There should be a points system where people transgress, and there have to penalties to take cognisance of the nature of the transgressions.  Central to the application of any such system has to be a right of access to the courts if a person feels aggrieved by the imposition of a penalty. The Minister said we can have that on a point of law. That is his "out" in respect of the application. I did not realise this was coming up today. There is huge amount in it. I looked at the statutory instrument, which the Minister, Deputy Creed, sent to us, in the past hour. I think balance of probabilities will be hard. There will be a determination body with three members. The Minister assures us that they will be selected independently, but the SFPA will be involved in the selection and can get rid of them if it is unhappy with them. If we are going to have a system, it will have to be robustly independent. It has to not just appear to be independent, but has to be seen to be independent. Perception becomes reality. If people feel aggrieved by that, they will rebel against it. It is very hard to see, in this context, how a quasi-judicial tribunal, which the determination body of three independent legal assessors will be, can work. These are given constitutional recognition under Article 37 of the Constitution. Normally, they work on the balance of probabilities. That is intended here but in respect of this, where reasonable doubt is intended to be the criminal standard to apply, it will be very difficult to set it up. Therefore, it would be better to give people right of access to the courts straight away.  I can see where the Minister is coming from. There is going to be a determination body, then a right of appeal and eventually time will run out. The three years will be gone because it is from the date of the detection of the offence that the penalty is applied, not the date of a successful prosecution. That is an issue. I cannot see how a tribunal can be set up in that way. It is not going to be easy. I refer to points of natural justice - nemo judex in sua causa and all of those things. Anywhere there is a criminal penalty or sanction involved, people are entitled to those protections. They are laid down constitutionally in our laws and we cannot deviate from them irrespective of whether we find that administratively simpler or whatever. We have to maintain those.  I am confused about this. This would be a quasi-judicial administrative body going to operate to a criminal standard. I concur with Deputy Gallagher's observation that all bodies contained in the statutory instrument must be robustly independent. There should be no crossover in respect of roles or inputs. There should be none of that. He made reference to the SFPA having the power to choose or remove the determination officers. No such power should be vested in the SFPA. We have to move away from that. On the time for appeals, there are 30 days for a social welfare appeal. That is for people who are arrested at home at an identifiable address. I am not an expert on fishermen - other than the boats on Lough Ennell or Owel, which is different from fishing the high seas - but some of these people are working from various addresses or working at sea and may not come back for several days or nights. The five days, therefore, would be gone.  There are a number of points that can be addressed easily by the Minister. As one of my Labour Party colleagues said, I am eager to ascertain the nature of Deputy Gallagher's rationale for rejecting this. It is historic. Statutory instruments have been subject to a virtual nod and wink policy in this House. I have spoken on this on a number of occasions and said that it is not appropriate that statutory instruments be used. I refer particularly to where significant issues of policy implementation are being addressed by a secondary legislation route. They should be subject to scrutiny by debate. It is hard to envisage putting in place an administrative framework for the imposition of a criminal sanction by virtue of a stand-alone quasi-judicial body and perhaps it would be safer to have access to the District Court secured.  Deputy Gallagher has done us a service. Forgetting the nature of what is going on here, but there are significant elements of legal implications and impositions in statutory instruments. They have been whooshed through with nods and placed in libraries and all over the place. It is a bad practice and it should not be done. They have been subject to court interventions on numerous occasions. I can see why; I know the background to this with the 2009 regulation. It facilitated the implementation of a points system. We seem to have been dilatory in getting this in place. I know about the Supreme Court judgment in December where the State was found against on a number of issues of a technical nature. It permitted the State to implement a stand-alone system. It appears to be of an administrative nature rather than separate to a prosecution through the courts and such a system could be facilitated by the statutory instrument system. I will not argue with Mr. Justice Donal O'Donnell. He is a leading Supreme Court judge and probably one of our finest jurists. He indicated that it should operate efficiently and appropriately. The veil of constitutionally guaranteed legal protections which one has would have to envelop any system put in place. An oral hearing in respect of an appeal is an absolute prerequisite if we are to have a system. This is very important. We have it in agriculture where we are setting up a new system and debating it even now. It is very important in the interests of the wider fisheries industry also. Money will be withheld and we will have EU infringement proceedings from the Commission.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, Deputy Gallagher, the Fianna Fáil Party and any other interested parties should get together immediately and reach an amicable compromise in respect of what needs to be done. Any more delay will see Ireland subject to daily fines once the EU Commission moves to the formal infringement proceedings, as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said. Once that happens, money and scarce resources will be wasted. Ireland must comply fully with its obligations under EU law. We have had proceedings in 2014, 2016 and now in 2018. Let us put our heads together and resolve this once and for all. I support that move.

I thank Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher for bringing forward this motion, which is vitally important. The motion calls for the rescinding of Sl 89 of 2018, which sets up a penalty points system within the fishing industry. The previous scheme had been challenged through the courts and found to be wanting and this is the replacement. I wonder why we cannot get this right, and it points to very serious problems within the Minister's Department.  One of the things I find very disingenuous about the Government's reaction to this motion is the pretence that things are urgent and time is of the essence in setting up the penalty points system. The Government has had years to do this properly. In fact, the Minister, in his response to a question from me about this last November, stated that it has been going on since 2009. We are eight years down the road now and we are being told that this is a matter of urgency. A couple of hundred million euro is dependent on it being done now and we cannot rescind the statutory instrument. I think Fianna Fáil was in Government in 2009 and failed to deal with this also.Granted it was cancelled by the courts and perhaps that could not have been foreseen, although I have my doubts about that. The original scheme was struck down by the courts because it did not contain fair procedures capable of being written into the system from the very start. This always seems to happen with fishing, which is interesting. I might be wrong, but it seems to me that there is no other aspect of the Government work that relies on the courts to sort it out. Indeed, the parent Department that fisheries is under can now work without the courts at all and I wonder when that will get through to that Department. The Minister will say that is because all fishermen are confrontational but I do not believe they are any more confrontational than farmers. When this issue is sorted out, perhaps there is work for the Minister to do to figure out why the courts are such an integral part of our fishing industry.  This is the third attempt we have made to deal with the penalty point system. One wonders why it takes three attempts to deal with a system that is largely laid out in European legislation. There are many things wrong with this system. How is it that an application for an appeal is allowed up to 20 working days but an application for an oral hearing of an appeal has to be made within ten working days of that date? Surely 20 working days would not be too long or cumbersome for the State but it would make a huge difference for a skipper or boat owner. Different dates will lead to difficulties; there are five, ten and 20-day limits within the statutory obligations.  In cases of the transfer of the entitlements to fish, the points will be assigned on each part of the transfer, which is crazy. For example, if four points have been assigned to a vessel and it is then sold and the tonnage is split between a number of vessels the four points will apply to each part of the transfer. It is simply amazing, really, that the Department would allow this to happen. Surely the Department knows how vessels are sold and tonnage is split up, or indeed the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA knows. Yesterday the Department said that it had nothing to do with enforcement or criminal applications within the procedure. The SFPA obviously has sole responsibility, so it should know all about it. In the case of criminal proceedings, it is possible for it to be found a couple of years later that nothing happened but a boat would still have penalty points for it. It does not make any sense. The Minister has pushed this through without consulting with Members of this House or the Oireachtas committee. I have been raising this issue for a number of years at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the first I heard of it was when it was put on the agenda. The Minister has not consulted with anyone about this.  I really wonder whether the Department actually wants to make a system that works and is acceptable to everyone or whether it wants to have everything its own way. I believe that is at the root of the problem. Time is running out. That is not the problem of fishermen or the owners of vessels; it is clear that it is the responsibility of the Department. There is a matter of justice involved in this process, which is not at dispute. All anyone wants is a system that allows for a fair hearing and I do not see any proposals from the Minister that includes that.  The Minister should take the points system back to the drawing board and design a system that will work for fishing communities to ensure that we have a system that is fair to everyone. If he cannot do that without losing out on funding from the EU, the only person to blame is himself, as well as his Department.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	248	The substance of the new statutory instrument does not give one confidence it would survive another High Court challenge with respect to the fairness of proceedings. The Minister, instead of introducing primary legislation or substantially altering the statutory instrument, has acted in haste and is using the threat of fines and withdrawal of funds from the EU as a stick after the fact to force this through. This is not to criticise the penalty points system in itself; it is a necessary system which is important to the enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy and, critically, to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of supporting maximum sustainable yield. Things get murky at this point. The debate here is not really getting to the crux of the matter. Fish stocks are plummeting and overfishing is a reality in Ireland. Fish quotas are in place because there is a limited number of fish in our waters. We cannot increase the fish quotas until the fish stocks increase. The fish stocks cannot increase until we tackle the real issues facing fish stocks. We need effective legislation to tackle fishing operators who overfish. That means taking on major industrial polluters who warm the waters around our island and further afield. It means taking on the agricultural industry over eutrophication and water extraction on our rivers. It means shutting down all coastal salmon farms that spread sea lice and forget to report salmon escapes. It means doing something to tackle the domestic use of harmful cleaning detergents, to tackle sewage discharge and anything that contributes to global warming.  Sadly, the Government is largely responsible for much of the overfishing. During the December 2017 negotiations on total allowable catch, TAC, for commercial fish stocks, where comparative scientific advice was available, 57 TACs were set above advice, amounting to over 206,000 tonnes of excess TAC. This is continuing the trend of permitting overfishing in EU waters, with Atlantic TACs set 9% above scientific advice on average. The Irish Government secured a TAC 18% in excess of available scientific advice, impeding the transition to sustainable fisheries in the EU and endangering the future of jobs in this industry.  According to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the level of non-compliance with regulations within the Irish fishing fleet is consistently low and most of the people in the industry want to work within the law. On the other hand, the infringement rate in Ireland is so low in comparison to other EU countries - nearly ten times lower in some cases - that one wonders if Irish fishermen are the most law abiding in Europe or if they are getting a free ride. Whatever about the inadequacy of the statutory instrument, most of the infringements are for pretty straightforward offences. The most recent report from the SFPA cited 23 incidents arising from inspections that led to 42 infringements being investigated. These were mostly to do with inadequate log book record keeping. Giving the inspection officials from the SFPA the benefit of the doubt for a minute, and presuming they know what they are doing, if one gets penalty points on one's licence and one does not want to be struck out, the obvious thing to do is to obey the regulations. The Minister had secured the quotas that will ensure that there will be no livelihood in the industry in years to come due to overfishing. Why should one not keep doing Government-mandated overfishing, keep one's head down and wait for the points to expire? A few powerful players in the industry have found a mechanism to get the penalty points system thrown out again and again, and the Department is not responding to the issue in a way that does not put the whole points system at risk, and is acting in a rushed and irresponsible under the pressure of fines and withdrawal of funding from the EU. At the same time, it is difficult for people to have much faith in the spirit of the Common Fisheries Policy regulations when the Government is securing quotas that endanger the whole industry in the long term.

It is wrong to think that small infringements by these people will be dealt with via a statutory instrument. He should bring legislation through this House in order that we can all see what he is doing. Why does he not do that? Why is he beholden to Europe, which is not always on our side? This will affect everyone, down to the smallest operator. A tribunal, where a lesser standard of proof is required, is proposed to incriminate people and penalise them. That is my gripe with what the Minister is doing. He is very close to Castletownbere, Dingle, Cahirciveen and all those places. I am amazed that the Minister is taking this high-handed action to deal with all the hard-working people whose lives are in danger most of the days they are out at sea.

These were once mighty ports with mighty fishing vessels coming out of them, all the way down to Unionhall and Kinsale. That has withered away, bit by bit, because successive Governments have not stood by the fishermen. I have no problem making it known that I am totally against the recently published statutory instrument, which was set to introduce a penalty points system for fishing infringements. This proposed points system is completely unfair to fishermen. Not only can points be allocated to the fisherman's licence, they can be imposed on the fishing vessel itself. Why should fishermen suffer for the actions of others? Have our fishermen not suffered enough? They have suffered at the hands of a previous Government in 2007, when a drift net ban was put in place. It was promised at the time that this would be reviewed after seven years. It is now 2018 and nothing has been done about it. In short, fishermen need more support from our Government. The drift net ban needs to be reviewed immediately if fishing and coastal communities are to survive. Two High Court judges and the Supreme Court struck down the previous penalty point statutory system introduced by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in a case brought before the courts by two Castletownbere fishermen. It is quite extraordinary that despite that fact, the current Minister, Deputy Creed, has decided to try to enforce European Union penalty points legislation by means of another statutory instrument without proper debate in this House and without a proper consultation with the industry. I am extremely happy that the two Castletownbere fishermen ensured that the previous statutory instrument was struck down by the Supreme Court. I am reflecting the anger within the fishing community up and down our coastline. The fishermen had to go to the courts and expend enormous amounts of hard-earned money. The Minister and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, were wholly dismissive of the concerns of fishermen when they first decided to introduce penalty points. Unfortunately, despite the kicking the Minister and the SFPA received from the courts when the previous legislation was struck down, it appears that this Minister is hell-bent on reintroducing the legal concept of administrative sanctions while repeating mistakes made with the previous legislation. For the ill-informed, I wish to make clear that this statutory instrument repeats mistakes made in the previous one. This Minister insists on attempting to repeat the imposition of concepts of punishment that are wholly novel in an Irish context. The result of the introduction of these regulations and this form of punishment is that fishermen will once again suffer from a double exposure to crime and punishment. They can and will be prosecuted before our criminal courts by a closed administration system organised and run by people nominated and staffed by the Minister or the State. We need to support the hard-working fishermen of this country. I understand that some form of control system needs to be implemented, such as maybe a yellow card system. There should be proper deliberation, giving everyone the opportunity to speak about the system and the problems with it. We need to stop pandering to Europe. That is all we are doing - pandering to Europe the whole time. With any issue, whether it is agriculture or fisheries, we pander to Europe and lie down for it. We need to consult with the men of the sea who have been chased out of our own waters for years with little or no support. Brexit is going to prove to be another nightmare for Irish fishermen. I call on the Minister to stop compounding the difficulty with further severe punishments and to stand by our fishermen.

My job today is to speak up for small fishermen who have been blackguarded not just by this Government, but by successive Governments over the years. When I think of fishermen, I am thinking of the people I was elected to represent. They are in Dingle today. They are fishing out of Tahilla Cove in Sneem. They are in Castletownbere. They are people I speak to on a daily basis in Cromane, dealing with the trouble they have in trying to make a living. At the end of the day all everybody is looking for is a thing called fair play. Unfortunately, over the years, small fishermen have been blackguarded. They have been let down, not just by the Minister, but by his predecessors of all political persuasions. There is nothing wrong with a small fisherman trying to make a living. Indeed, they are treated like criminals. I see what happens in the dead of night when these people are out at sea. They are just doing their work in bad weather and all types of weather. Their vessels are boarded and they are treated like criminals. Again, that is wrong. At the end of the day, they are Irish people, Irish fishermen trying to make a living. Europe has dictated to us for long enough. We sold out an awful lot when we gave away an awful lot of our territorial waters. I have seen this first hand and I have raised it over the last several weeks. I have dealt with the Minister and his office with regard to particular details. I want to thank him for the work he has done on many of the problems concerning fishermen about which I have approached him personally. It would be unfair of me not to acknowledge that and I do so. I am thankful for the Minister's help. However, he knows that what I am trying to highlight is the inadequacies in the system, whether they affect the fishermen at sea or the small people working with pots who are trying to make a living and who are being blackguarded, not just on a weekly basis but on a daily basis. They should be treated in the same way as the small farmer, in that they should be allowed to make their living. I call on the Minister at this late hour. Anytime he makes a decision such as this order concerning penalty points, I ask him always to remember that there are small fishermen out there who want to pass on their tradition. They want their business, which is a small business, to continue with family members. Unless they get assistance from the Minister, his Department and future Governments, they will not be able to survive.

Sometimes things go in cycles. I remember that in the early part of the last decade, in 2003 and 2004, the whole issue of fisheries management was centre-stage. I remember the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Noel Dempsey, had a bit of a struggle in his own party. There was a very heated contest around the introduction of new regulatory measures. At the time, I very much supported him in introducing the sort of sea fisheries protection authority which we are now discussing. I remember at the time sitting on a committee when the manager from one of the banks in Killybegs came begging us for help. He realised he had made a mistake. He had lent €400 million to the fleet there. A photograph of the fleet would show that any one of the vessels would catch more or less the entire Irish quota. The maths did not add up. The €400 million would not be paid back by what would be caught within the quota. The fishermen at the time said they were sick and tired of the illegality. They were sick and tired of catching four or five times the quota and operating through different forms of subterfuge. They said it was time to clean up their act. Here we are 14 years later and we are still not cleaning up our act. I stand with the Minister on this issue. I think it would be a real tragedy for this Dáil to vote down a proper regulation of our fisheries, a proper penalty points system, and I say that for the sake of the fishermen. In the long run, if we continue to allow fishing to exceed quotas and to ignore the environmental prerogative to protect our fish stocks, there will be no fishing industry. It is in the industry's interest for us to have a sustainable, properly regulated and properly policed system so that fair play can apply and the fishermen and women who adhere to the rules know that they are not being undermined by a system which allows someone who is willing to bend the rules to get away with it. It beggars belief that 15 years on we still do not seem to recognise the basic principle that protecting our environment equals protecting our rural communities in the long run. That is why I support the Minister. People say that the Minister has not heeded the Supreme Court judgments. I find that hard to believe. I am not a lawyer. I trust the Supreme Court to make the decision, but I have confidence that the Department has taken them into account in resetting these regulations.I heard what the Minister of State said - I accept her word on it - to the effect that we have adjusted to take account of the Supreme Court recommendations. If there is a sound legal argument against that, I am sure someone will take a case and let the matter be decided by the courts. It is not for the Dáil to become a quasi-Supreme Court. When I heard the various arguments, none convinced me that the institutions we have set up cannot be trusted or that we could not possibly have anything that is in any way influenced by the statutory organisations we have put in place to try to provide such protection. I despair of the sentiment that we do not trust our own system. When I hear the wholesale demeaning of the European Union regulations, I would say that I am critical of the European Union in that it has not been strong enough on fisheries protection over the past 40 to 50 years. We sold out when we entered the Union. We sold out our fishermen to benefit our farmers. I would love to get a hell of a lot back. I am glad that the sort of debate we should be having here took place in the Seanad earlier. There is a real interest among Members of the Upper House in establishing the type of marine protected areas that would protect our natural world from all the international vessels fishing in our waters. Most of the vessels fishing off our coast are from other jurisdictions. We would protect our fisheries stocks for the future if we went the route to which I refer. I wish we would look at that as an urgent issue for debate in the Dáil. We cannot blithely ignore the European Union regulations. I accept the Minister of State's argument that we will lose €37 million. If we sign up to the motion, we will throw away money with the fines. There are also other significant implications for us. We also need to stop being the country that is top of the league in terms of environmental infringement. At some point, that will cost us. The rest of Europe will catch up with this country and say that we can no longer play fast and loose with environmental regulations, which is what we are proposing to do. I support the Government in this approach, not because it is a great champion of the environment but because we have to hold the line on this issue and stand up for putting in place a penalty points system, not weakening, debasing and undermining the Common Fisheries Policy. We should then seek, from a position of strength, to go further and set up marine protected areas in which fishing stocks would be protected and move away from the system whereby a small number of very large vessels seem to dominate Irish industry interests and are able to obtain a huge chunk of the quota. I would much prefer to see a more labour-intensive system where we support smaller inshore fleets and more sensitive, sustainable fishery methods. There is a whole range of things we need to do on this. The recently introduced proposal on the restriction of the number of large vessels operating within the 6-mile limit, stopping the catching of sprat - the feedstock for larger fish - starting a move towards the creation of significant marine protected areas, accepting the wisdom of E.O. Wilson, the great biologist, to the effect that we should set aside half of our natural world for conservation, because it is in dire trouble. In that context, the extinction of species, particularly in our marine environment, is a real threat we have to address. That is what we should be debating, not looking for further delay, prevarication, excuses and avoiding taking responsibility for looking after our fishing stocks and, by dint of that, our fishing industry.

I have observed developments in this country over many years. We seem to have an obsession with using the stick first rather than the carrot when it comes to EU regulations. We all know how essential this industry is. It gives employment to over 11,000 people, full-time and part-time, and, as Bord Bia has indicated, is responsible for €645 million in seafood exports. This is the third attempt to introduce penalties, with a huge amount of time already spent in the courts. In my view and in that of many others in Fianna Fáil, that time could have been spent providing funding and finding common ground. Deputy Gallagher has flagged this issue, and not just in recent times. He has raised it at meetings of our parliamentary party and in fishing communities. I commend him on his diligence in that regard. It is important that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine does not blame us for stalling. If this discussion had taken place with the interested parties - I encourage him to find time to have that discussion with them - the issue could have been resolved quite quickly. Whether it is the fishing communities in Clogherhead, Annagassan, Greenore or Carlingford in County Louth, or those in Killybegs, Castletownbere and elsewhere on the island, SI 89 of 2018 is going to have an impact on them. I reiterate that Fianna Fáil is supportive of the introduction of a penalty system for serious and flagrant infringements of the regulation. As previous speakers indicated, however, rules are about fairness and proportionality coupled with rights and entitlements. They should be at the core of the penalty system. We have a problem with the wording relating to the appeals process and, as Deputy Gallagher stated, we are seeking a workable solution. All we request is that the statutory instrument be withdrawn and an amended version be brought forward to ensure that proper transparency and fairness will be there for all concerned. As matters stand, the statutory instrument undermines the rights of fishermen and vessel owners in all of our coastal communities. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the issues which are causing the difficulties to which previous speakers referred be addressed. I urge the Minister to take this opportunity to go back into discussions. I am of the view that the matter can be resolved quite quickly.

However, aside from and as well as this picturesque, ideal vision, it must be remembered that this industry was worth €645 million in exports in 2017. We all agree that regulations need to be in place and that infringements must be addressed. Therefore, a penalty points system is necessary. As my colleagues have already pointed out, however, such a system needs to be fair and respectful of fishermen's rights. As matters stand, under this statutory instrument, the fisherman or licence holder will be guilty until proven innocent. A burden of proof based on the balance of probabilities is totally inadequate. How can a system such as this be conclusive? The proposed penalty points system makes no sense. Logic would suggest that points would arrive on the basis of a haul in its entirety. However, here we have a system whereby if a haul was to be sold in separate lots, penalty points would affix to each lot. This is unfair in the extreme. I know that many fishermen have expressed concern on the independence of the SFPA. It appears that this is justified in some cases. For example, I am advised that there were approximately 1,400 Spanish landings at Castletownbere and that the vessels involved were not exposed to a fraction of scrutiny that was levelled at Irish vessels making landings in the same harbour. By all accounts, the difference is glaringly obvious. Surely consistency is of paramount importance in order to be in compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy. Aside from this, the statutory instrument provides that the SFPA will assign penalty points. Then the authority will assign a three-person determination panel to assess whether an infringement has occurred. This panel will decide whether an oral hearing may be conducted. I cannot see any impartiality here. If it exists, perhaps the Minister will point it out to me.Then there is the appeals process, which also creates huge problems. Ten days are allowed to request an oral hearing or to forward a written submission. In general, an appeals process would allow a window of up to 30 days, and this is even more important in circumstances where fishermen are regularly at sea. Constraints like these are not helpful. All in all, this statutory instrument is ill-thought out and not fit for purpose. As my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, has pointed out, it has already been challenged successfully in the courts. If further challenges are to be avoided, it is time for reasonable and sensible amendments. This has gone on for far too long.
#JohnBrassil	unknown-#JohnBrassil-party	unknown-#JohnBrassil-dob	unknown-#JohnBrassil-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	258	The points being made today by Fianna Fáil and in particular by our spokespersons, Deputies Gallagher and McConalogue, are fair and reasonable. We want to support a system that is fair and in principle we support the penalty points system. Anybody who is in breach of the law should see the appropriate treatment. However, we must be fair to an industry that contributes significantly to our economy and the people who work extremely hard and in extremely dangerous conditions to make a living. By and large, they are law-abiding and they have the interests of their industry and fishing stocks in their heart. As has been pointed out, this has been challenged twice before through the courts and it has failed. Would we not be better spending our time introducing a statutory instrument that is fair and which works, with cross-party support, rather than trying to bulldoze through something that will again finish up in court and, in all likelihood, again be thrown out? We would be back to square one. The issues with the penalty points are blatantly unfair and I will not repeat them. Let us look at them and get a workable system in place. We must be fair to people on appeal. There are many cases where people can be accused of something in the wrong and giving them ten days to put together an appeal is just not fair. A reasonable time would be 30 days. Ten days are allowed for a written submission as well but we must be reasonable to people. In any walk of life, if a person is accused of something, they must be given the opportunity to appeal it and have the time to put together a reasonable case for defence. Listening to colleagues and Deputy Ryan, it seems that with a little bit of cross-party work we can put together a procedure that would have the support of the House and the effect of ensuring the vast majority of fishermen working within the law would have the law behind them, with those working outside the law being punished appropriately. I ask the Minister, rather than bulldozing this or using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, to work together with us in the interests of fair play to formulate a workable and fair statutory instrument.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	259	With regard to the momentous decision that this House will be asked to vote on next Tuesday - I appreciate the period between this debate and then - the House must look at the process by which it takes significant decisions like this. As the Government representative I am challenged by a wall of different views and it is entirely inadequate to get across the complexity of the message involved at the heart of this in the very little time afforded to the Government in Private Members' time. That is not any reflection on Deputy Gallagher, and I appreciate his long-standing concern on this issue. We have had long-standing engagement on it. What we are about to do and reflect upon is extraordinary and significant. I will put it in financial terms. There is €37 million of funding available to us under the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which is immediately in the firing line. There is over €200 million available in the MFF that supports the fishing industry in many ways, including processing, improved gear selection etc. That could be further jeopardised. We should also bear in mind that back in the early 2000s, the French were slapped with a fine for non-compliance with fishery regulations of €50 million every six months. We are about to embark on something that has enormous financial significance and the Government's opportunity to respond to this initiative amounts to two ten-minute slots in a debate. This is the only opportunity available to Deputy Gallagher but now is an opportune time to reflect on the gravity of what we are considering. Another point being made loosely is what would happen if only the Government acted "legally". I ask Members to think about that. It has also been a criticism that we have been here since 2014 and there was a statutory instrument in 2016. The point was made by Deputy Pearse Doherty but that statutory instrument stands approved by this House. It is something we must reflect upon in the context of a vote that may take place next week. The argument was made that this Government is being reckless in the context of the Supreme Court ruling. It was right and proper that we waited on the High Court adjudication and the appeal to the Supreme Court before acting on a 2018 statutory instrument, and that is exactly what we did. That ruling did not come until December 2017. We have not hung around or prevaricated. We moved appropriately after a Supreme Court adjudication, which made two very distinct and important findings. It indicated it is appropriate to proceed by way of administrative sanction through a statutory instrument. For the first time, it was confirmation that we can have administrative sanctions by way of a statutory instrument. On narrower grounds it found against the State and therefore the 2014 statutory instrument fell on the basis of the burden of proof. The 2018 statutory instrument has totally responded to the High Court ruling and the burden of proof has been changed entirely. Many Members have called it unfair, with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony saying somebody is guilty until proven innocent, but that is not the case. Many Deputies who spoke have not read the statutory instrument in detail, and it has much detail addressing each and every finding in the Supreme Court ruling. Deputy Gallagher made a number of points, apart from his protestations that he is in favour of administrative sanctions, as he should be. This regulation was negotiated and approved by a Fianna Fáil Minister. It is prescriptive and there is no wriggle room. It is what we are implementing by way of statutory instrument. Deputy Gallagher indicated he is in favour of a points system but objected to the level of proof being "balance of probability". The Supreme Court stated quite clearly that we can have an administrative sanction regime - a European points system - but the burden of proof for such administrative sanction is the balance of probability. It is not "beyond reasonable doubt", which is the criminal sanction. Deputy Gallagher must make up his mind as to whether he wants to abide by the Supreme Court ruling or a hybrid system unknown to anybody with on one hand a balance of probability and, if we do not like that, an option of beyond reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court ruling in December 2017 clearly stated we can have a balance of probability administrative sanction regime. Access to courts is provided for on a point of law. What else would one want access to the courts for other than on a point of law?I very much take the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan. I think his point was subsequent to that of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, but Deputy Murphy O'Mahony again brought into question the integrity of a State agency. Would we attack the Garda in this House like we feel free and willing to attack the SFPA and to impugn its integrity and its commitment to doing its job right and proper? I do not think we would. We certainly would not do so with the Garda and we should not do so with the SFPA. A point was made about the sale of vessels and how that is being dealt with in the statutory instrument. I wish to quote from the EU regulation that was negotiated by Fianna Fáil. It states, "The points assigned shall be transferred to any future holder of the fishing licence for the fishing vessel concerned where the vessel is sold, transferred or otherwise changes ownership after the date of the infringement." The criticism in this regard of the statutory instrument appears to me to be that we did not leave a loophole such that one could shift the tonnage or in some way diminish the impact of the sanction of points because one could shift tonnage in a way that minimised the impact of the conviction. The regulation is effective in this regard, and it is right that it should be so. This has been spun, of course, as an attack on the whole fishing industry, but nothing could be further from the truth. Who fears a points regime? The fishing industry? Only those who break the law fear such a regime. To take up the point Deputy Danny Healy-Rae made, this is not about minor fishing infringements; this is a regulation that is specifically designed for serious offences. It is not about the generality of the fishing industry, which, by and large, is law-abiding. However, those who commit serious offences deserve the full sanction of the law and I do not think anyone disputes that. However, to judge from the contributions, one would think we want to create a fog and to have a system of administrative sanctions but administrative sanctions on a "beyond reasonable doubt" evidential standard. That hybrid does not exist, Deputy Gallagher. We need to be realistic and fair about what we are talking about. If this were only about timelines and oral hearings, I am sure we could fix this very quickly. However, there appear to be much more fundamental issues at stake here about whether we accept the findings of the Supreme Court. That is, I think, what is at issue. I slightly digress, but Deputy Calleary, as a legal person, must have smirked in some respect about the issues surrounding the Supreme Court ruling and the hybrid evidential standard being advanced. However, he did talk about the inshore fishing industry, and we currently have under way a consultation for the inshore sector. I look forward to the support of those who spoke very eloquently about the fishing industry and the inshore sector in the context of the recommendations that might come to me in due course about how we might best protect those in the inshore sector to ensure they can make a living in a challenged environment. I made the point earlier to Deputy Pearse Doherty about the 2016 statutory instrument. We had the 2014 statutory instrument. That was the subject of a High Court and, most recently, a Supreme Court ruling. The 2016 statutory instrument, which Deputy Pearse Doherty, for some reason, seems to think he voted down, was not voted down. It stands approved by the House, and we will have to reflect on that. As I said at the outset, the process for dealing with something as significant as this is inadequate. This is the first time the House has sought to annul a statutory instrument, and we should not do that without reflecting quite seriously on the consequences. The consequences are very significant in terms of the financial cost to taxpayers. We are not talking about small change here; we are talking about many millions of euro of taxpayers' money, money that is invested to protect the best interests of the fishing industry. I stand by the fishing industry. It is my job to stand by the fishing industry and I am proud to do so and to make efforts to build an industry that can achieve its potential. It is interesting to hear the contributions concerning our entry into the European Union and how it might have been sold out etc. Our industry today is multiples the size it was when we joined the European Union. Our industry then was by and large an inshore industry. We now have a fine fishing industry and we look for the maximum possible sustainable opportunities for that industry. Key to this is having an effective sanctions regime for those who put the livelihoods of the majority in jeopardy by unsustainable fishing practices. That is in essence what is at the heart of this matter. It is about penalising the few who are serious lawbreakers. This is not for minor offences.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	260	I thank my party colleague and spokesperson on the marine and fisheries, Deputy Gallagher, for bringing forward this important motion. The reason for the motion is that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has laid before the House a statutory instrument known as the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018. This statutory instrument allows penalty points to be applied to fishing vessel owners who ostensibly carry out illegal and unregulated fishing. My party is not opposed to the introduction of a penalty points system for serious infringements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. However, any sanctions to discourage this activity need to have fairness, justice and equality for fisherman across the country at the core of such a system. However, sadly, it would appear that the Government's statutory instrument, as introduced in March 2018, does not display these qualities. Previous attempts by statutory instrument to resolve this issue have been found to be unconstitutional and this statutory instrument and the appeals process involved once again appear to be problematic. There are very real concerns that there has not been appropriate and fair consultation with those directly affected. As I said, this is now apparently the third time to resolve this issue. Two previous attempts were struck down and there have been comments about money being spent. However, the State must have incurred significant costs in the courts system in respect of these statutory instruments. As I said, I very much welcome Deputy Gallagher's bringing forward of this motion because it is crucial. In the recent Storm Ophelia, fishermen in Wexford faced significant damage and suffered significantly. Fishermen are struggling across the country but in particular after the damage that was caused by that storm. While we see compensation and support for farmers regularly, and that is welcome, I am at a loss to understand why fishermen cannot be supported in a similar manner. The programme for Government sets out very clearly that the blue economy is a key industry. However, we are not seeing, in my view, the necessary supports put in place to support the blue economy and the fishermen, in particular small fishermen who are very much struggling and will continue to struggle for some time because of this issue. I return to the statutory instrument at hand. Significant concerns are being raised in this House about this statutory instrument, in particular its fairness and a resolution of this issue must be found. Fishermen who are fishing illegally, who are not reporting their catches, need to be dealt with and taken in hand. However, this needs to be done in a fair, workable and balanced manner in order that ordinary decent fishermen are not caught up in it.

As a Donegal Deputy, I am extremely pleased and proud that four of the five Donegal Deputies have come in here and contributed to the debate, namely, myself and my colleagues, Deputies McConalogue, Pearse Doherty and Pringle. I thank them for their support. We would get the impression from listening to the Minister that this is all about money and that it is money that is so important. Let me remind the House of something. I have said it in the European Parliament, where I was a member of the fisheries committee for 14 years, working very well with various Ministers while I was there. I have worked there, I have said it there and I will repeat it here: the sector that has paid too great a price for membership of the European Union is the fishing sector, sharing our prolific grounds with all the European countries.That cake was divided. The key issue now remains as it was then. The only increase we ever had was in boarfish. I single-handedly ensured that. There might not be an abundance of boarfish now but when they do return, we have the highest percentage, at almost 80%. I did that on my own and did not have the support of the Government of the time. I refer to a point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan. Whoever was briefing the Deputy in the early noughties is still doing so today. He is making allegations that the industry does not respect the rules and regulations. I have never seen the industry more regulated and more compliant than it is now and I am sure the Minister would be the first to acknowledge that. The Minister asked "What about the points?" He is correct. They are not with the boat, but they are with the capacity and the Minister has acknowledged that in correspondence with me. It is all right to say that it is there when it suits and it is not there, but it is there. I do not have the time to go through the Supreme Court decision but in the coming days I will circulate to the Minister the amendments which I believe can be accepted by the Government and this House. We will not procrastinate. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said that the reason for supporting this statutory instrument is because we are jeopardising €40 million in European funding. Is that a good enough reason? Are we prepared to sell the industry out once again, as it was sold out in the past? It is a pact. The Minister has said himself that it is not a good enough reason. It is ironic that last Thursday or Friday the Government decided it would ask for extra time. This is nothing short of blackmail. Whatever number of millions is in question, it pales into insignificance with the amount of millions of euro that have been lost by the sector. I have always said that the engine of economic growth in the country is the private sector. It provides jobs in the most rural, peripheral regions where there is no alternative source of development. It is not the Government that provides jobs in those areas, but the fishing sector. The Government does not rural-proof its policies, as those of us who come from the peripheral areas of Europe know.  I am sorry that Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has returned, was not here earlier when I observed that the fishermen are the most compliant fishermen in Europe. Whoever is briefing him about letters to the Commission in 2004 should know that things have changed since then. We do not have time to discuss this today, but he is a good friend and I can explain it to him one-to-one another time. The Minister made comparisons with the gardaí which I think was wrong. The proposed structure would be similar to the gardaí in detecting an infringement, later selecting the judges to adjudicate in the case, and that does not make sense.

If the Minister will let me, I will go through all of this because I have made it out in a tabular statement, where the judges have highlighted it. I would go further. The Attorney General who is advising the Minister and who was quoted at the time also has issues with this and no reference was made to that. The Minister should not suggest to us that it is all on this side of the House. It may well be that the system here regarding statutory instruments is wrong. If it has to be changed, let us change it. Myself, Deputies Willie Penrose, Martin Kenny and others have offered to work with the Minister in coming days. I am sure that Deputy Eamon Ryan will also work with us, and put aside views he might have, to provide the Minister with a statutory instrument that will be acceptable. I am not proposing something off the top of my head. I have consulted widely on this and more than the Minister has. The Minister has consulted on the margins with the industry but he has never set out on a one-item agenda to discuss this. The article which appeared at the end of March 2018 says:Mr. Woulfe also warned that a new 'penalty points' system aimed at fishermen who engage in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing is likely to face a Supreme Court challenge. The Cabinet signed off on legislation to enact new EU laws last week. He described the new bill as "controversial" and "difficult". Those are not my words, but those of the Attorney General. He said:The EU loves these things about sanctions regimes. Instead of just prosecuting people and having the criminal system and the civil system, you've something in between which is a sanctions regime.Those are not my words: they are the words of the Attorney General.

Amendments Nos. 8, 10 and 14 form a composite proposal. As the division on amendment No. 8 was lost, technically amendment No. 10 should not have been moved. However, it was moved and was agreed on a division and, in accordance with established precedent, that decision cannot be revisited here. Any anomaly arising in the text of the Bill can be addressed, and will need to be addressed in the Seanad. Amendment No. 14, also in the name of the Minister, has not been moved and cannot now be moved.Furthermore, amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, 27, 54 to 57, inclusive-----

The same principle applies to amendments in the names of Opposition Deputies. Amendments Nos. 24, 43 and 63 are consequential on amendment No. 6 which was negatived and therefore they cannot be moved. These amendments are in the name of Deputy Jim O’Callaghan. Similarly, amendments Nos. 16, 28, 44, 59 and 86 are consequential on amendment No. 13, which was negatived, and therefore they cannot be moved. These amendments are in the name of Deputy Clare Daly. I am sure that is all very clear.

How will the Seanad possibly interpret what the House was doing in the way it voted on amendments Nos. 8 and 10? I presume the Ceann Comhairle is suggesting that the Seanad will have to make some sort of decision in regard to those two amendments. It will then have to come back to the Dáil. Given the list of amendments which the Ceann Comhairle said have been ruled out of order, one would presume that the Bill will have to return to the Dáil after it has gone through the Seanad. I am perplexed as to how that could possibly work because the Bill will then undoubtedly have been amended by the Seanad. We would almost be going back to an entirely new Report Stage but with a different Bill from what we have here. It seems to me that there is a fundamental flaw in the Bill and rather than trying to squeeze it through the process, we should look to start the process again and do it properly. I presume the Seanad cannot consider the amendments which have been ruled out of order as they were not tabled by Members of the Seanad, so how will they be considered?

In this situation it is obviously over to the Minister to consider how he is going to approach matters as the Bill goes to the Seanad. The amendments we are talking about here can be reintroduced. We cannot predetermine how the Seanad will address those amendments. Obviously the Senators will be briefed on what has transpired here. We have embarked on a process and, with the best will in the world, I do not think we can abandon it at this stage. We have to see it through to its conclusion. The Bill will inevitably present challenges both to the Minister and to the Seanad in terms of its arrival there. The Deputy is right. If the Bill is further amended in the Seanad, it will have to return to us. An extraordinary set of circumstances obtains here but we have to work our way through it. Perhaps the Minister will give us some advice on the matter.

Following the voting on a number of tabled amendments last night, it would appear that they raise a discrepancy. Having regard to that discrepancy and arising out of what has been agreed here openly, I feel that the only manner in which these issues can now be addressed successfully is in the Seanad - by successfully, I mean in a way that ensures we have legislation which does not have the inconsistency or discrepancy which it has now. I do not hold with Deputy Ryan's views. We will proceed to Second Stage in the Seanad. It will be open to Senators, at their discretion and in their wisdom, to table amendments in accordance with the established practice and procedures of the Seanad. It is reasonable to say that there will be amendments which may attempt to address the inconsistency. Any amendments agreed will be the subject matter of a report from the Seanad to the House at a later stage. I am inclined to agree with the Ceann Comhairle's comments.

Time was needed to reflect on what had happened here yesterday evening and last night with the votes and the subsequent votes after decisions were made. These decisions are now very questionable. We are in what I would consider uncharted waters. Having received advice on this subject today, if the Bill leaves this House and goes to the Seanad and the Seanad is let do what it likes with it, the Bill will still have to come back here to us again. This is completely unprecedented. To say that it is an unmitigated mess would not be an exaggeration. I do not think something like this has ever happened before in this way. That is why it is so important. One would have to question what we are doing with this Bill at all. What are we trying to achieve with it? What are we questioning? Why are we doing what we are doing? If any outside person who was knowledgeable of the legal process and the systems, checks and balances that are in place was to stand outside the Chamber, that person would now ask what these politicians are actually trying to achieve because what we have done so far is to make an absolute mess of it. The one person who has been highly vindicated is the person who christened this Bill a dog's dinner. It was probably the most apt description of a Bill that ever came before this House. Nobody can question his judgment, because his judgment and verdict on this Bill was 100% bang on and he has been proven right.

Can that be overturned? That is my first question. If the Minister was honest about it he would have to admit that we are now dealing with poor legislation in an incredibly important area. Does he not think that we should go back to the drawing board, start again and do it right? Ploughing on with poor legislation is a poor form of government. It is not good and will not reflect well on us. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle can answer my question. Will the commission now be confined to 13 members or can that be overturned despite the House voting for it last night?

It is worth pointing out that it was the two amendments tabled by the Government, amendments Nos. 8 and 10, that gave rise to this difficulty. I do not see any way out of this other than the line being suggested by the Ceann Comhairle and which the Minister has advanced. We need to recognise that we need to take the element of trying to work to the Minister, Deputy Ross's timeline out of this. We know that the Minister is blocking the appointment of judges at present and that this Bill has to be passed in order for him to take away the prohibition on new judges being appointed. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Government need to wake up to the fact that the justice system in this country cannot be controlled and run by one Cabinet Minister, who is not even the Minister for Justice and Equality. We need to recognise that this is a very complex area in which we are trying to set in place a new commission to advise the Government on the appointment of judges. Much more consideration needs to be given to it. What we cannot do is rush this into the Seanad, get a quick fix there, bring it back here and try to proceed as fast as we can in order to please one member of the Government. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, needs to assert his responsibility in respect of this area. He needs to identify a path for the Government and Oireachtas showing how we will reach a satisfactory resolution in respect of this matter. We need the Government to act with collective responsibility, as opposed to individual responsibility.

The optics of what has happened are certainly not good. Many amendments have been ruled out. I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's position. We adjourned last night in disarray and he had to try to sort this out. I am not questioning his decision at all. He has informed us that several amendments, or up to 30, as far as I could make out, may not be moved. Certainly, the number is in the high 20s. The Ceann Comhairle mentioned that the matter might be dealt with in the Seanad, after which the Bill will return here. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, cut his teeth in the Seanad. I wonder where he is. He is not here tonight again. We all know this is his Bill and that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is shepherding it through like a substitute driver. When the tachograph period runs out, one has to get a different driver to drive the vehicle. One cannot stay driving after a certain number of hours. I do not believe there any laws in this regard when speaking in here. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport could well be here to let us know why he got us into this sorry mess. Deputy O'Callaghan and others referred to the dog's dinner. I do not believe any dog would even eat the dinner as it now has such a vile taste. While the Minister might have had good motives when he started out, the Bill has just gone all over the place. It is off the tracks and is totally unwieldy. I mean no disrespect to my learned colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, in saying the Minister's ambition might have been to rein in the King's Inns. That was probably his initial attack but, like a blunderbuss, he has widened it to many areas. We all know the Minister has been and is holding up the appointment of judges. That was quite public. A number of judges have been appointed in spite of the Minister. To think that he might be holding up appointments considering the backlog of cases in our courts at all levels, from the High Court to the new Court of Appeal, is of concern. Cases are being fast-tracked in many cases, which is very strange. I am not a lawyer or legal expert but I know that while justice delayed is justice denied, justice rushed could also be justice denied. Hundreds of cases were held in a couple of weeks. This could be justice denied. I am quite alarmed. As I stated, we are in uncharted waters or unfamiliar territory. Should the Cabinet not withdraw this Bill and reintroduce it in a proper, structured manner that we would know about? On the holding up of the appointment of judges, the Minister, Deputy Ross, is the same Minister who accused us of delaying the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill when we were representing our constituents. We were saying it was a mess of a Bill and not fit for purpose. That is all we were doing. We were trying to represent our constituents and point out obvious flaws in the Bill. It may be dealt with here tonight if the Bill under consideration is finished. These are two Bills that the Minister, because of his ego, is desperate to pass in the Houses in some form before he leaves office. This will be his monument. It is some monument and some legacy to leave this kind of mess. So many amendments have been ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle because of what happened last night with amendments Nos. 6 and 10. While I had a number of points to add on this, I am just so all over the place now that I do not know whether we are coming or going. As I said, one Cabinet Minister should not be allowed to cause this kind of trauma and stress here. Deals were done with various parties to get this Bill over the line any which way, as the former Ceann Comhairle said last night. It is a desperate attempt to keep it alive, get it over the line, and get it into law and out to Áras an Uachtaráin.

I am not trying to hold up other speakers but am saying the Minister should be here. I did not criticise him for not being here. He was criticised for not being here but he should be big enough after what happened last night to be here and debate the Bill. He generated the Bill. I am sure most of the Government amendments have been submitted by him and his officials. I know there have been some fiery exchanges in the Cabinet over this, and I know there have been some with the staff of the Whip's office to try to get this in here at all costs.

I am sorry if I am. With regard to the two legal institutions, King's Inns and the Law Society in Blackhall Place, the solicitors' area, we need significant reform.

I do not want to go through all the detail of it but I have to say it was utter confusion. Arising from that confusion, I will not say there is no clarity but that there is no great clarity on the process from here on. Looking at the very serious content and intent of this Bill, I believe it would be worthwhile giving consideration to withdrawing it and reintroducing it when fully thought out and when it deals with the issues that have arisen in the context of the debate on it up to now. Part of the purpose of the Bill is to reform the way judges are appointed but there is no other offer of reform in the Bill. Legislation is more often questioned and challenged outside this House now and in that challenge, commentators reflect on the course of the debate in the House. This is a Bill that should not have any question mark over its passage. There should be no question mark whatsoever allowing legal eagles outside the House to pick holes in the Bill's content and in how it was dealt with and passed in here. It would serve us far better as legislators to concentrate on the complete withdrawal of this Bill and its reintroduction to the House when it is appropriately dealt with.It reminds me of the case I mentioned last night and the outfall of it in terms of the imprisonment of a woman, Yvonne Walsh, in Mountjoy Prison. She cannot purge her contempt of court because she is not the person to do it. Grant Thornton continues to pursue her. She is 21 days in jail. Her two 15 year old children are doing the junior certificate. She is a lady who wants to comply with the courts. What has been set out for judges, and what has been set out in that case, is an example of very poor administration of justice. I was with her for an hour and a half, and I have to say this debate now is similar to the one she is encountering. The onus is on us to get it right. I appeal to the Minister to have some sense in regard to this, disregard the agenda of the Minister, Deputy Ross, focus on the intent of the Bill, be far more reforming in terms of its content and come back into the House and allow us have a proper debate on it. We should reach that decision quickly rather than go around in circles on it.

There will be no account of the Minister, Deputy Ross, when this Bill is found to be wrong in the fullness of time but the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is bringing the Bill forward. There is a money aspect to the Bill as well, which will cost the taxpayers more money to fund this change and set up a commission that will advise the Government as to who should be appointed to whatever judicial position is vacant and the Government may or may not go with that. In spite of its recommendations, which may cost €1 million a year, we could find that the elected Minister or the Government of the day will not go with whoever the commission advises should be put on the Bench. I could think of other things the money would be better spent on such as the people who must travel to Belfast on a weekly basis to get their eyesight back.

I am delighted to get the opportunity to contribute for two minutes. This is a holy mess and, to be honest, everyone in the country knows it is a holy mess. They were all talking about it last night. It is not of the Minister's making but, sadly, the finger will be pointed at him and as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, he can be damn sure the Minister, Deputy Ross, will be writing about him in a very short period of time. This mess is in the hands of the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he is not here to explain himself. He is hiding. This is an astonishing situation. To be honest, it is embarrassing and confusing in light of the fact that the Bill now has to go back to the Seanad. When we first debated this Bill a number of months ago, a vote was called. It was a Thursday. I remember that I voted a certain way and rushed back to a committee I am involved in, the Schull show committee. I got a text from the Minister, Deputy Ross, that night. I have no problem getting a text from the Minister. I am delighted to get a text from a Minister and I am easily able to text back. He was surprised at me that I voted in a certain direction and I told him that the Bill was confusing. I told him at that time that it was going in a direction that does not make any sense. I am only a young garsún inside here in the Dáil, and most people might say with very little understanding, but I knew at that time we were going in a certain direction that did not make any sense to me, as naive as I thought I was. However, it turns out that I was 100% correct in my assertion at the time. I plead with the Minister to withdraw the Bill and throw it in the bin. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is the cause of what is nothing short of filibustering. He is using delaying tactics that are costing the State money and costing public representatives their time and energy in this House. He should come in here, explain his carry-on and the errors he has committed regarding this Bill. I ask the Minister please to give serious consideration to binning the Bill and let us get back to putting it right. He should talk to the Minister, Deputy Ross, and get him to bin other Bills also that are the cause of hardship and misery in this country.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	334	There is obviously a degree of urgency to enact legislation around the area of judicial appointments. I understand there are a number of appointments that have not been made to the Court of Appeal and that dates for cases in the Court of Appeal are now being set in 2020. The first question I ask the Minister is whether judicial appointments now are effectively frozen because that is a political issue the Government has allowed happen on the one hand while, at the same time, we have to address this legislation. The Ceann Comhairle's note indicated that if we were doing things again we would probably do them slightly differently and that after the Government's proposal to increase the commission membership from 13 to 17 was rejected, the subsequent amendments would not have been taken. As it transpired they were taken, and therein lies the confusion. While the Ceann Comhairle has said, and the Minister has agreed, that we can refer the Bill to the Seanad, amend it and revert to this House, the real concern is that if the Bill is subsequently challenged and the debate is referred to in terms of the intent of the Dáil, it then becomes very unclear because on the one hand we voted that there would be 13 members on the commission but on the other hand we added three additional members, being the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court and the Attorney General. When that debate arises, the question will be whether it is 13 members and who the three additional people are replacing.It has added serious confusion. The Minister knows as well as I that when a Bill is challenged in this way, it is frequently the case that the transcripts of the debate in the Dáil are needed in order to understand what Members were trying to deal with. I agree with Deputy McGuinness that the correct procedure would be to withdraw the Bill and start again properly. It would add the level of clarity that is required. I asked the Minister about what will be the annual running cost of the commission, particularly when he said it was a 17-member commission. I alluded to a figure of €1 million and the Minister told me subsequently it was €500,000. I want to put on the record that this figure of €1 million comes from the explanatory memorandum. I do not want the Minister to think we are exaggerating the figure. They are the figures the Minister presented to the House.

I agree with what my colleagues said. There is an awful lot of confusion, particularly with regard to ministerial responsibilities. I raised that issue last night. I agree that the Minister should consider withdrawing the Bill and starting again. The latest proposal that arose in the past few days involves using the opportunity of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill to bring in some changes relating to sentencing guidelines. While I welcome the sentencing guidelines, just blending them with this Bill seems inappropriate. People also took the opportunity during the debate to question the decisions of judges of particular courts without offering any particular evidence during that debate. That is quite scandalous. I was thinking about some of the statements that were made last night. We may come back to that again. One issue I raised last night concerned the example of family courts, which are in camera. I have received suggestions from constituents that some of the decisions and behaviours of judges raised the need for supervision of judges. That is the kind of thing that could be included in the Bill. What the public will be most lost about is the fact that even after we go through all of this process, the Government may discount all the suggestions and recommendations made by this new proposed quango and actually make its own decisions relating to the appointment of judges.

This includes most of the parties in Opposition with the exception of Sinn Féin. I think this is an aspect of this as well. The Minister seems to be content with allowing a below-standard piece of legislation to be passed in a ham-fisted and amateurish way. It damages the Department and the Minister. The Minister is allowing the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - by means of the comments he made over the past number of months - to damage our Judiciary. Can someone tell me which judges have been appointed incorrectly to courts in our country since Independence? The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has raised questions about appointments by saying that they were due to cronyism and political deals. Which judges does he think should not be serving right now? Which judges do Deputy Ó Laoghaire and Sinn Féin think should not be serving right now? That is the issue that is fundamental to what they want to do here in appointing a commission with a majority of lay people - of people who may very well have an axe to grind with certain members of the Judiciary. I put it to them that probably many members of Sinn Féin may have an axe to grind with certain members of the Judiciary as well. What we are trying to do here is very serious. For the first time since 1995, the Government is changing how judges are appointed. I do not believe the system was broken and I do not think the Minister believes that either. At the whim of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and in order to keep the Government going with the support of Sinn Féin, which did not actually recognise many of the courts 40 years ago let alone the Judiciary itself, the Minister is willing to take a hammer and change how appointments are made. I really believe that the manner in which this debate has unfolded and also that in which these amendments have been dealt with mean that as part of a duty of care to ensure that legislation is robust, the Minister must withdraw the Bill and start again. When the public looks in from the outside at how this has been dealt with by the Department, it raises further questions about the latter and about the operation of the Cabinet and how it is proceeding, with the support of Sinn Féin, to fundamentally change how judges are appointed. What is being done is absolutely wrong. The Minister should withdraw this legislation now.

I do not want to deal with the substance of the Bill. Rather, I wish to focus on the technical difficulties with which we are faced. It would be ludicrous to proceed on the basis that we accept that what we have done is flawed but we will continue with the process and expect the Seanad to clear up the mess in some kind of ham-fisted way. This is really an appalling vista, if that is not too strong a phrase. I have some sympathy for the Minister because I know the difficulties he has at Cabinet level and I know the issues he has with one member in particular and his band of merry warriors. I served with him in the Seanad and I know his form. The thing that catches me out a bit is how this creates a problem for Sinn Féin because I am at a loss to understand how it is beholden to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. It entered into an agreement with the Minister for Justice and Equality in good faith and I understand that. I might not agree with it but I understand it. However, when an event happens, as happened last night, surely Sinn Féin will not continue with this charade of allowing the Seanad to clear up the mess created by this House. Surely Sinn Féin has more respect for its role as a key Opposition party and will not allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage in bullying because he is a member of the Cabinet. Surely Sinn Féin will call him out on that and support the House in seeking the withdrawal of the Bill. Sinn Féin can support the contents and provisions of the Bill with which it has sought to agree. Whatever grubby deal it has done in some other way, it will get all of that in due course. It should, however, show some respect for the House for God's sake. We spoke for a long time about ensuring that those of us outside of Government would have some level of input into the workings of this House. The first opportunity Sinn Féin got, however, it has chosen to work hand in glove with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and bully the Minister opposite in order to drive ahead regardless of the mistakes that have been made. It can still get its way but it should show respect for the House, its procedures and the way in which legislation is or should be properly formulated. We should do the best we can do with it in this House. Fair enough, if something arises at a later stage, all the other checks and balances that exist can be applied. However, let us not let a Bill go out from here and say "Sure we know we made a mess of it and we'll let some other organ of Government or of the procedure and process tidy it up." I recognise that some of Sinn Féin's members are relatively new to the democratic process here but in respect of their understanding of it, I appeal to them to come on board in respect of this matter.

It was a combination of the sequencing of the amendments and then an amendment being tabled when perhaps it should not have been. Frankly, what has happened is not that unusual, albeit it is happening in the context of a more high-profile Bill that has been the source of particular discussion.

During the course of these subsequent amendments, we will tidy up anomalies that currently exist and have nothing to do with last night's amendments, but to do with votes won by Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace and O'Callaghan on Committee Stage. They will rectify the inconsistencies that were created on that Stage. Those amendments will be discussed subsequently and will be resolved. After these amendments, the Bill will be in a better shape. Those Deputies who have been engaging with us on an ongoing basis will be aware of that. I believe the Ceann Comhairle is right that there is no other sensible way to approach this but to proceed carefully, judiciously and to pass the necessary amendments. I know the Deputies are having a lot of craic, but hand in glove-----

However, we are in a completely unprecedented situation here where we are about to debate the remaining amendments which have not been ruled out of order without knowing the cornerstone substance of the Bill we are debating. We do not know if it will be a commission of 17, 13 or 16. We do not know if it will include the Attorney General, which is a not insignificant, substantive issue in the nature of the commission. The Minister might outline how he intends to resolve the issue. Does he intend to introduce in the Seanad an amendment to remove the intention of having the Attorney General, the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court or does he intend reintroducing an amendment to provide for 17 members or 16 members in a commission? If that is the case, we are putting the Seanad in a very difficult situation because it will be debating, for example, that amendment to have a larger number of members without knowing when it is returned back to this House whether the Members here would stick to the votes we made last night. For example, would Sinn Féin change its position as it voted last night against having 17 members? We are legislating here in the blind and we are asking the Seanad to legislate in the blind before it comes back here again.

A large number of amendments sought to change the composition of the commission to increase the membership of the commission, while at the same time maintaining a lay majority. It is worth reminding Members as to what took place because there seems to be a difference of views here. I sought, by way of Government amendment, to have the two lower court presidents, the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court, as full members of the commission and to reinstate the Attorney General for the reasons I outlined, not only on this Stage, but also in some detail on Committee Stage. My amendment No. 10 achieved that. I sought to replace the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission with a nominee of that body who would be a layperson and my amendment No. 12 achieved that. I also sought to increase the number of laypersons by one from six to seven. This was in the context of our debate where everyone was in agreement that we should have a broadly based commission. However, my amendment No. 14 would have achieved that if passed. I acknowledge now what the Ceann Comhairle has said. I fully accept his ruling that the discrepancy or contradiction - it is no more than that - which arises from the defeat of my amendment No. 8 would have changed section 10 to provide for a commission of 17 in place of a commission of 13 and the subsequent passing of amendment No. 10 relating to the addition of three members. Therefore, the effect of the defeat of amendment No. 8 and the passing of amendment No. 10 is what was agreed to in the House. It is inconsistent, but it was voted upon. I do not intend to withdraw the Bill because I believe we have a pathway forward, as outlined by the Ceann Comhairle at the commencement of this evening's debate. I accept that it is not ideal, but I acknowledge the will and wishes of Members of this House as manifest in the vote. I listened with great detail to everyone's contributions and I now believe that the object of our exercise must be to move forward now with a view to addressing the inconsistency, and I believe we can do it. I welcome the positive disposition of Members who agreed that should be our priority. However, other Members have different views. I wish to respond to a number of serious questions raised here. I welcome the contribution of Deputy Curran, a former Government Whip with some experience of the practice and procedure of the House. He made a point about the operational and set-up costs. He rightly referred to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. However, he omitted to say that on Committee Stage we changed the architecture from how it appeared when the Bill was originally submitted. At the behest of the committee - again by way of lawful democratic vote - we removed much of the architecture that was going to consume some of the projected cost. The Department of Justice and Equality estimate it to be a little more than half of the amount to which Deputy Curran adverted. It will be in the region of €500,000 to €600,000. It is obviously very difficult to put an exact figure on it, but it is important for us to be familiar with the parameters. There is no veto on the appointment of judges, nor should there be, nor can there be as far as Government is concerned with particular reference to the constitutional role and function of Government in this regard.I might add, for the information of Members, that there is no change to the constitutional position on the appointment of judges. This advisory commission will recommend a number of names to Government but the constitutional and legal position will not change in regard to the obligation, power and authority on the part of Government to nominate, for appointment by the President, members of the Judiciary. There is no veto and there is no freezing, which is evidenced by a number of recent appointments that were well received in this House. I acknowledge the positive contribution of Members in that regard. I agree with much of what Deputy Darragh O'Brien said. I do not agree with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in many of the comments he has made. I put that on the record last week when he was sitting beside me, lest there be any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of my comments. We agree to differ. We are members of different parties. We are together in a partnership arrangement and we have agreed a programme for Government. While I very much respect the entitlement of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to hold an opinion, I do not agree with that opinion and I do not share his view. I acknowledge, of course, that this reforming legislation is in the programme for Government and, of course, the priority of any Government is to proceed with the implementation of its programme. This is a Bill produced by the Department of Justice and Equality in accordance with the commitment given in the programme for Government. While I am pleased that we have made some progress, I am disappointed that we have not made the type of progress I and many other Members would have wished. However, I do not see the need for any rush. In fact, anyone who read the Committee Stage proceedings would be of the view that there are not too many items of legislation enacted here in the past couple of years that have been given such detailed consideration. That is testament to the authority of the justice committee, which I welcome. I am a democrat. I also welcome the fact we are operating in a minority Government situation. This is important, reforming legislation. I urge Members to continue to work on it with a view towards improving it. Of course, I acknowledge that there is now an inconsistency but that inconsistency was a result of a democratic vote in the House last night. I voted in a particular way but a majority of Members in the House did not agree with that and, of course, I accept that. I agree with the Ceann Comhairle when he says there are now a considerable number of amendments that he feels should not, in the circumstances, be put. I believe that to be the correct course of action because the amendments that will not be put are the amendments deemed out of order. All of that is as a direct consequence of the actions we took last night. In the normal course of events, that would occur in any event. However, the difficulty arises due to the fact we are left with an inconsistency. I believe there is a way in which that can be dealt with. I acknowledge what has been said in that regard by Deputies O'Callaghan and Ó Laoghaire, both of whom have been involved in the detail of this legislation since its publication. I am of the view that we can move forward on the matter of these amendments. Of course, I will accept the democratic wishes of the House as far as the endorsement, or otherwise, of these amendments is concerned, and we will then proceed to the Seanad. However, this will not be done in any rush or with any undue haste, but only having given the matter careful and due consideration. That is my obligation. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have an obligation to ensure there is a duty of care, to quote Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I take that role and function seriously. My duty of care is to enact a piece of legislation that is legally sound, constitutionally robust and workable, and I think we can do that.

It is fair to say there is a certain amount of artificiality about what we are now proceeding to do. We are going to deal with amendments in respect of an item of legislation when we do not really know what the core commission will be constituted of. We are heading down a dangerous path. There appear to be three options. There is the option put forward by Deputy McGuinness that the Bill be withdrawn. I understand the Minister has rejected that but perhaps he should reconsider it. The second option is that we go down the route outlined at the outset by the Ceann Comhairle. The third option is one we have not yet considered. It was the case that, yesterday, one of the amendments put forward by Deputy Wallace, amendment No. 7a, was tabled as a late amendment. Is it not possible that we could rise now and come back at a later time, when the Minister could bring froward further amendments which we would consider at that later stage? I ask the Minister to consider this. I want to acknowledge the point the Minister made when he indicated the cost of the commission will not be €1 million, as identified in the explanatory memorandum, but will be reduced to €500,000 per annum. I want to commend the justice committee because, as a result of its work, according to the Minister, it has managed to reduce the running costs of this quango by 50% through its amendments. That needs to be recognised.

I understand the predicament he is in and I thank him for his clarifications, especially those on why the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot be here and on how he disagrees with his colleague. That is healthy in any democracy. Nonetheless, I am still very concerned. We are in uncharted waters and there are too many anomalies. While I do not want to disrespect the Ceann Comhairle in any way in regard to what he suggested, I believe the most honourable and respectful course of action for the Minister and the Government would be to withdraw the Bill at this time. As Deputy O'Callaghan said, there are three options. The second is to do as the Ceann Comhairle said and the third is to do what we did with Deputy Mick Wallace's amendment No. 7a last night. It is very strange territory, particularly given the genesis of the Bill. I also acknowledge the work done by the justice committee in regard to amendments. The spectacle here last night was totally unsavoury and while I am not blaming anyone for that, there was utter confusion. Although the Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for marching the Bill through the Houses, the Minister who designed it, and who has got his paw marks and fingerprints all over it, is as láthair - absent. I am sure he is up in his office watching this in order to know what we are saying about it, but he is now like an absentee landlord from the hills of Killiney. He is out there like the lord of the manor.

We are here discussing his mess, and a damn fine mess he has created. It should be withdrawn. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill and give it back to the drafters and the Department to try to amend it. If we give it to the Seanad and it sends it back to us, not knowing what we are going to do, the whole thing is ridiculous.

What was put out there, with absolute fanfare, as the supposedly greatest radical reform in appointments to the Judiciary in the history of the State has turned out to be an absolute and utter debacle in terms of what went on here last night. It actually copper-fastens political influence in the process and makes for more political interference than existed previously. While the Minister said that what we are doing here is legally sound and workable, I do not think he can say that because we are buying a pig in a poke.In fact, such was the mess last night, we do not know what we are buying here. We know that side deals are being done and people are being brought on side with various commitments but that makes a nonsense of what is one of our most important areas of work, because the role of the Judiciary is absolutely critical. While I do not think the amendments were perfect, nor do I think they were dreadful but the scenario we have got ourselves into is worse now. It would be best all round to withdraw the Bill because people have been contradicting themselves. Last night, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Labour Party voted to reduce the numbers and then voted to put three extra people on. It is absolute lunacy. Sinn Féin Members were doing side deals. They said on the record that they would vote for the position outlined in Deputy Wallace's amendment, in which the presidents of the District and Circuit Courts would be put back in, but that they did not want the Attorney General in and wanted a lay majority. Although this was provided for in Deputy Wallace's amendment, they did not support it because they had done a deal with the Government, presumably on sentencing, which will not be really enforceable anyway. The Minister says this was not rushed and that we are not being hasty with amendments being brought back here. This time last year, the Minister's predecessor sat down with the heads of the Department of Justice and Equality and committed that the number one item of priority legislation was on mandatory inquests in respect of maternal deaths, in the form of the proposed coroners (amendment) Bill. We discussed the timescale and the possibilities for its enactment by last summer, not this summer. I raised it with the Minister and raised it with the Taoiseach in February, who told me it would be published that month. The Minister told me in March it would be published later that month but there has been nothing. Where is the rush there? This is a nonsense, particularly when one sees the Judicial Council Bill 2017 languishing in the Seanad. That is an opportunity for real reform but we get this nonsense. It is a disgrace.

The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 is now discredited. I have my political manners and I place great significance on the fact that Fianna Fáil is not happy with this. Fianna Fáil Members are the people helping to keep the Minister in his position in Cabinet and the Government in place and if they are not happy with this Bill, it is in serious trouble. It is not just Fianna Fáil looking for it to be withdrawn. There are people on the Independent benches who have worked diligently in their roles and many have concerns over this farce, and not just because of the confusion and disarray of yesterday evening and today. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a lot of experience and he knows that there is a bad smell of trouble in this Bill. Sometimes, when a thing looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. I strongly advise the Minister to go back to Cabinet and ask what the Government is doing. He is on a folly and sometimes, when a person is in a hole the correct thing to do is stop digging. After hearing the Minister speak tonight, I have the feeling he is in a position of trying to defend this but does not want to be in that position. He knows he is trying to defend the indefensible. It is wrong and it is unfair that the person who is proposing this, who has masterminded it and who wants it to go through, is not here. He should be here and should not be leaving the Minister to hang out to dry and to face questions from all of us.

It appears we are trying to unscramble eggs but are not making too good a job of it. We are going around in circles time and time again and, as a number of Deputies have said, we find ourselves in a place we do not want to be. This matter is extremely important, in that it deals with judicial appointments in the future. The manner in which this debate has evolved over the past number of months will have been alarming to people looking in from outside. The Attorney General, who was advising the Government on legislation, described the Bill as a dog's dinner and that was borne out yesterday evening. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, had to have crisis talks on this legislation but it is an awful pity he does not have crisis talks on critical legislation that is needed within his own Department. A second runway at Dublin Airport is under construction but we do not know whether it can be in operation when construction is finished because, for 18 months, the Minister has dithered over who the competent authority was going to be. In the past three months, he called in party representatives over a new competent authority and we are still awaiting legislation on that.

It would be far better if the Minister for Justice and Equality took full responsibility for this legislation, told the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to butt out and to do the job which he was given the seal of office to do, withdrew this Bill and did it properly in order that we could have robust legislation. Let the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come into this House and deal with a Bill he has been trying to bring through the House for the best part of 18 months but has been unable to, namely, the drink-driving legislation he initiated in February last year. If he cannot bring his own legislation through the Dáil, the Minister for Justice and Equality should not let that Minister bring him down in respect of his own legislation.

The confusion still exists, however. We are still discussing a Bill and amendments without knowing whether there are to be 13 or 17 members of the commission. We do not know if the Attorney General is to be a member of the commission but the Minister realistically and honestly expects us to conclude the Bill. There is another option and it is still available, even if amendment No. 7a is not.The option is still there for the Minister to withdraw the Bill. It could then be reintroduced. That would be the cleanest, most honest and most direct thing to do rather than discussing a Bill where the central part - the establishment of the commission - is so confused. The attempt to conclude the remainder of it is a mistake. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, still has the option to withdraw this Bill.

While that is something on which the Ceann Comhairle can adjudicate when he has a minute, I do not think they can be pushed at the moment. I am not sure if they can be tabled now although we would be happy if they could. I am sorry that Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 24, which is also consequential on his amendment No. 6, cannot be moved now either. This is key because that was to get rid of the Public Appointments Service as the body to appoint lay members and he was proposing that it be replaced with a system whereby lay members would be nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Citizens Information Board and so on. We had something similar on Committee Stage. While that cannot be moved, the discussion and the problems with the Public Appointments Service have to be re-echoed. It is not ideal. It is unsatisfactory that the PAS has been given the role of appointing the lay members. There is huge potential for that in indirectly rechannelling ministerial influence through the PAS. It is also the case, and the point was well made on Committee Stage, that the type of expertise that was being sought for commission members came from the commerce, business or senior civil servant type of background, which could be far more susceptible to political influence and far more connected to the political classes, than any members of the Judiciary in many instances. What we would get would really be an optical replacement of, mar dhea, lay people but which would be just as susceptible to political influence as any other body. In that sense, it is really regrettable that those amendments cannot be tabled. I refer to Sinn Féin's amendment No. 29. It seeks to change the criteria by which PAS selects lay members. It is broadly similar to what is in the Bill already, with the key difference that it proposes a diversity and social inclusion appointment category. It is more complicated to involve the PAS. I note a technical problem with it, in that it is called "the public appointments commission". I do not know if that will be a problem with it going further but the PAS is being maintained with a list of nominating bodies called the "Diversity and Social Inclusion panel". Those bodies would nominate three of the lay members of the commission. The bodies on the panel would have to demonstrate their relevance to the objectives of diversity outlined in amendment No. 3 or on the nine grounds in the Employment Equality Acts. It is a very novel and good idea, even though it is a little complicated. I am willing to forfeit its complexity in deference to the important contribution it could potentially make towards encouraging and expanding diversity. In light of some earlier amendments that were not moved, it is important that this amendment would be moved and consequently, we will be supporting that Sinn Féin amendment No. 29.Although it is complex, it would, as I said, add to the Bill. Amendment No. 38 is quite important as well. We will certainly be pushing it, particularly if Sinn Féin's amendment No. 29 does not pass. We are proposing to delete the provision that lay members of the commission would have knowledge or experience of processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sectors organisations. In other words, it is a kind of automatic pass on to the commission for retired senior civil servants. It is not what the intent behind the legislation was when we spoke of appointing lay people; we were talking about people who reflect the most diverse aspects of Irish society. Amendment No. 40 is in this group and it is still in order. It is our tidying-up measure relating to an amendment we successfully tabled on Committee Stage providing that one of the areas of knowledge or experience that commission members should have is of "civil society, trade union activity and academia". Our tidying amendment would change this to "or academia" as our original amendment could have had the consequence that one of the criteria for the appointment of lay members is to have knowledge in all three areas, which was not envisaged. This amendment makes it clear it would be one or the other. Government amendment No. 41 reinserts "board membership and corporate governance" as one of the skills the lay members must possess. We got rid of this on Committee Stage and it is incredibly insulting to committee members that the Minister would try to reintroduce this now. There were incredibly strong arguments made as to why this should not be the case if we are to reflect a more diverse and real sort of background. It is regrettable that the Minister is sneaking it back in here. We will strongly oppose that. Amendment No. 42 is a Government tidying-up measure in respect of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. As we have already voted to accept a member in other parts of the Bill, the amendment is absolutely fine. The other amendments in this group are out of order. I believe they were all tabled by Deputies O'Callaghan and Wallace and myself, although I am not completely sure. We had much discussion on Committee Stage on this and we feel strongly that there must be a check on the role of the Public Appointments Service in appointing lay people. Either our amendment No. 38 or, preferably, Sinn Féin's amendment No. 29 should be part of that, although only if linked with the rejection of amendment No. 41. That amendment is trying to prescribe the type of lay person we are to get, which if the amendment is accepted will not be diverse at all.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	418	We are debating a series of amendments proposing to amend section 12, which deals with the recommendation of lay persons for appointment as members of the commission or as chairperson of the commission. It is important to say at the outset that currently we do not know how many people we are talking about. Under the amendment passed by the House last night, there are to be 13 members of the commission. We know that five will be judges and three others will be lawyers, so I assume we are talking about having five laypersons. However, one of the downsides of the Government running with the legislation in the way it has is that we know it will try to increase the number when the Bill gets to Seanad Éireann. We really do not know how many members will serve on the commission. We know the Government wants a commission of 17 people but if there are to be eight from the Judiciary or legal profession, the Government will need to appoint nine lay people on to this commission. It is important to point out these people cannot be members of the legal profession or retired judges, for example. One would think it would be useful to have a retired judge on a commission to advise on the appointment of judges. It could be somebody such as Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who would be an excellent choice for the commission, or Ms Justice Mary Laffoy. They are not allowed on it because they have been "contaminated", as the Government sees it, by previously being a member of the Judiciary. It is easy for us in the House to try to put together legislation that will put lay people on this commission but we must understand and assess whether the section drafted and proposed by the Government would be feasible in terms of attracting individuals as lay members of this commission. We are dealing with a batch of 20 amendments, from amendment No. 25 to amendment No. 44, inclusive. Like Deputy Clare Daly, I would like clarity on her amendments Nos. 25 and 26. It is unlikely that they can be moved. However, I am conscious that the Ceann Comhairle gave a very detailed written ruling to the House when Report Stage resumed. Much consideration has gone into it and there is no indication that amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are not appropriate to be moved. If they are not on his list, I suspect we will have to move them. I will be supporting amendments Nos. 25 and 26. We know that amendments Nos. 27 and 28 have been ruled out of order. Amendment No. 28 has the objective of having the members of the commission elect their own chairperson. This was contained in my amendment No. 6, which was defeated by the House, and it is a very good idea that the commission should be able to elect its own chairperson. How will we distinguish as to who will be the appropriate lay person to be nominated by the Public Appointments Service as the chairperson? I do not know how those different characteristics will be assessed to determine a chairperson. It is worth pointing out that in the North there is an equivalent body that makes recommendations to government on the appointment of judges in Northern Ireland. The chairperson of that body is a judge. For the past 23 years, the chairperson of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has been the Chief Justice. For some reason a decision was made by the Government that it had to have what it referred to as a lay chairman; in effect, they want somebody who is not a judge or lawyer to be the chairperson. I have never got an answer to the question of what is the public policy benefit in having a person who is not a member of the Judiciary or a lawyer - it should be a member of the Judiciary instead of a lawyer - as the chairperson. I do not believe in deference to any group in society but if the Taoiseach was asked to serve on a committee but he would not be allowed to chair it, there would be outrage. That would arise because the Taoiseach is the head of the Executive branch and it would be inappropriate for him to be on a committee but not chair it. Similarly, if this House set up a committee to deal with procedures in the House and the Ceann Comhairle was a member, he would end up as chairman. I do not know if there is a committee in this House of which the Ceann Comhairle could not be the chairman. I do not know why the Government insists that the Chief Justice, who will be on the commission, should not chair it. This seems again to be an obsession of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the effect that the commission cannot be chaired by a judge. It is the wrong decision. The person on the board with most insight into what it takes to be a judge would be a judge. There is nothing controversial about that. I mentioned last night that if a panel was to interview people to pick the next editor of a national newspaper, surely we would want people chairing the panel who would understand newspapers and what it is to be an effective editor of a newspaper. For some reason, it is presented in this debate as though the last thing we should have is the Chief Justice chairing this commission. Amendment No. 29 is from Sinn Féin and I do not know if it is being pursued. I do not want to put Deputy Ó Laoghhaire on the spot. I am conscious that it refers to general lay appointments and the diversity and social inclusion appointments. We debated Sinn Féin's amendment last week.That amendment was withdrawn by Sinn Féin on the basis that the diversity and social inclusion appointments had the effect of removing the provision in the Bill which states that there had to be proficiency in the Irish language within the courts. That is an amendment I put down, and I know Deputy Ó Laoghaire supported it on Committee Stage, but I am not sure whether amendment No. 29 is being pursued. If it is, I will reassess it, but perhaps Deputy Ó Laoghaire could address us on that, if he gets the chance, to let us know if the amendment is going ahead. The remainder of the amendments are minor consequential amendments that seek to insert the word "lay". I will support amendment No. 30 which is solely in the name of Deputy Daly. I will support the other amendments which are in the name of both Deputy Daly and the Minister. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about amendment No. 41, which provides that the people on the commission would have knowledge of board membership and corporate governance. What does that mean? Are we going to have the great and the good and the same people against whom the Minister, Deputy Ross, used to rail for years as being the insiders in Irish society? Is he now going to allow the insiders in Irish boardrooms to pick one of the most important public offices in the country?

I will ensure that one of our Senators resubmits the amendment in the Seanad because it is a good model, and I appreciate Deputy Daly's comments in this regard. I ask the Minister to consider the model. As I said, it will be retabled in the Seanad. It is based on the premise we discussed at length on Committee Stage that there is scope to change the kind of people, to include lay people, we have on the board. We have lay people on many public boards, but very often they are drawn from people who might have come from particular circles and who might have been involved in particular parts of the public service and so on. All these people have a significant contribution to make, no doubt about it, but what we want to achieve is a greater level of diversity. The intention is to have a split between three who would be appointed from the traditional process and three who would be appointed through a diversity and social inclusion panel. That panel would have to be nominated from organisations which are on a register maintained by the judicial appointments commission, and they would have to advance the objectives of diversity and social inclusion. I will not push that on this occasion but I will ensure it is returned to in the Seanad. That is amendment No. 29. Regarding some of the other amendments in this group, I am satisfied that the chair is being kept, as is proposed currently. I note that there are lay chairs both in Scotland and in England and Wales. It is not unheard of by any manner of means. I support amendment No. 40, which I believe will likely pass. I do not see any reason for it not to. I also support amendment No. 38, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace, which would delete lines 39 and 40. It makes sense to remove that criterion. That experience is unnecessary for serving on this board. Further to what I said earlier, it is important that people come from a broad spread of backgrounds. It need not be people who just have managerial experience or experience of managing big bodies or anything like that. I do not think it is a necessary qualification for someone serving on a body that appoints judges. Therefore, I will support amendment No. 38 also.

There are a number of reasons for this, one of which is the Attorney General's advice, which has been quoted, that the Bill is a dog's dinner. The events of last night in this House have very much contributed to that atmosphere surrounding this Bill. I think what many people are deeply concerned about is the unholy alliance that the Government has built up with Sinn Féin in respect of this Bill and our Judiciary. If we want to see the motivations of the Sinn Féin Party in coming on board with the Government in respect of this Bill, we need only consider what Deputy Ó Snodaigh said last night in this House about the Special Criminal Court. It sent a chill down my spine and I suspect it sent a chill down the spines of many ordinary decent Irish citizens. Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated:I listened to the contributions and responses to what I had said earlier. If anybody wants a history of the anti-republican bias of judges in the Special Criminal Court, I have no problem at all.He went on to say:I will not necessarily go into it here. [He can go ahead and do so if he wishes. We would certainly be interested in hearing directly what Sinn Féin's views are.] It is not just about anti-republicanism and judges falling asleep on the Bench or a history of abuse to some of the people before them in that court. It is also in other courts.That is Sinn Féin's motivation in supporting this Bill. It wants in some way perhaps to get revenge or some influence on the courts system. A number of years ago, when there was controversy about Sinn Féin's position on the Special Criminal Court, a solicitor from Cork, Mr. Jim Brooks, wrote to the Irish Examiner. He gave a description of the IRA intimidation of Special Criminal Court judges. I will read part of it into the record. It was published in the Irish Examiner on 14 February 2016: Dear Editor, In the light of the controversy surrounding the Special Criminal Court I thought the following story might be of interest to you and/or your readers. At the height of the "troubles" I was in Dublin on legal business and I met one of the sitting Judges on the Special Criminal Court. He had been recently appointed and he recounted the following story to me. On the eve of his journey to Dublin to hear his first case he received a phone-call at home. The case involved an IRA Defendant and the phone-call went like this. Caller: Judge you will be hearing a case tomorrow and we would remind you that it would be in your best interests to deliver a Judgment favourable to the Defendant. The Judge put the phone down. The Judge received a second call seconds later. Caller: Judge please don't put the phone down. We know all about your family. The Judge cut him off by putting the phone down. Third call. Caller: Judge we know you have a young family. We know where they go to School and we know lots about them. The Judge put the phone down. The phone rang immediately again. Caller: Judge just to remind you that we know a lot about you and you might like to know that your Bathroom window is open. The Judge put the phone down, checked his Bathroom and found yes the window was open. The Judge was not intimidated.The letter goes on and is signed by Mr. Jim Brooks, a solicitor in Clonakilty. It is chilling to be aware of such instances that are reported and of the connections that members of the Sinn Féin Party and current Deputies have with persons who have been convicted before the Special Criminal Court. Deputy Ó Snodaigh's comments last night and his alliance with the Minister on the appointment of judges send shivers down our spines. I appeal to the Minister to use his better judgment and collapse this enterprise at once and tell the Minister, Deputy Ross, to worry about the bus system and the train system, forget about this and come back to us with reasonable proposals that can ensure the independence of our Judiciary is protected and enhanced, as it should be under our Constitution, in order that people can have confidence going before its system. I fear that, with Sinn Féin lining up with the Minister, the public will have less confidence in the Judiciary, in the judicial system, and that in fact it would be the opposite of what the Government intends. As Deputy Barrett very wisely said yesterday, this really is an abdication of responsibility on the part of the Government. It is also an abdication of Fine Gael's self-described reputation as the party of law and order. All I can do is lay the facts before the Minister. This is who he is lining up with on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. If he is satisfied with that, if his party is satisfied with that, go ahead, but I do not believe Fine Gael's voters will forgive it.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	421	Deputies Clare Daly and Jim O'Callaghan have gone through the individual amendments. My name is attached to some of them. At the heart of this is the so-called "lay versus law" dimension about which we seem so perplexed.I am totally in favour of a more broadly representative section having a say in how judges are appointed. However, there is considerable capacity for political influence being exerted over the lay members who are appointed to this commission. It could be done in a fair way but equally it might not. They may be of a particular political persuasion and might give a political dimension to how the judges are selected. It is more than likely that there will be five judges on the commission. Our proposal was also for five. The Public Appointments Service are selected by Government, the Public Appointments Service select lay members and the Minister has an option after three years to reappoint them for a further three. Do I think that we might have a better chance of getting a non-political, neutral position from a judge that has risen through the ranks and proved his or her self to be exceptionally good at their job - otherwise they would not have risen up through the ranks - that the layman will have a less political dimension and will be less political in their selection process than the judge? I am afraid that I do not. I am very wary of who will end up on it. Yesterday I asked the Minister where the lack of trust for the legal profession came from. We all know that not every judge is great, but not every teacher is great nor is every builder; there is good and bad everywhere. However, behind the Bill a lack of trust is being displayed towards the Judiciary and I do not accept it. We have been through all this in the Select Committee on Justice and Equality. My understanding of the principal reason behind reforming how we appoint judges was that we should make the process less political and that we should have less political say over what judges are appointed. We know that there has been political influence over the years. However, the judges there bear a huge responsibility in the spotlight. Take a judge who came from Fianna Fáil stock, for instance. Is it likely that after being a judge for some 15 or 20 years, he or she will automatically favour a Fianna Fáil candidate over another? I am not convinced he or she will. The Minister has not explained why the Bill has that dimension running through it, where it is as though we do not really trust the Judiciary. We had put down several amendments on whether there ought to be a lay chair. I do not agree with Public Appointments Service
having an elected chair. We favoured the commission that is being set up being the body to elect the chair. It is rational in any area of life that if a committee is formed, it makes such a decision, having sat around and discussed who among the members will make the best chair. I do not believe that giving the Public Appointments Service the power to elect a lay chair, and making it compulsory that the chair is lay, can be defended. It does not make sense. I am not hung up about whether the chair is lay or legal, I think it should be either and that it should be for the committee itself to appoint that person. Our big fear, which we expressed at the committee, was for people to be drawn in from sections of society that would not normally get a look in in the area of appointing judges. We put down amendment No. 38 which seeks to remove the line regarding, "processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations". As Deputy O'Callaghan said, more often than not, these people are the insiders in society. They are generally the people from an influential and powerful background. We do not think that these are the people we seek for our reformed judicial appointments system. We want people from a broad section of society and to give people who did not have a look in up to now a chance. People who are well up in the system are almost sure to have a political inclination which defeats the whole purpose.

We are discussing amendments that pertain to their roles while not knowing how many people we are talking about. I was looking at amendment No. 38. One thing that bothers me greatly is experience. It is the one thing in life that one cannot buy. No matter what one's job or role is or what function one performs in life, any person who is at something longer than somebody else and who has gone through life's trials and tribulations for a longer time than someone else will have to know more than the other person. When we talk about putting lay people into positions such as we are now, we have to really stand back and consider what we are trying to achieve. It is like what happened many years ago when some people decided the abolition of the dual mandate in local authorities was a good idea. They actually drained many local authorities of years of political experience in one day when they removed Members of the Oireachtas. Looking back, it was not a very smart thing to do. The people who did it will be remembered for a long time for scoring own goals and shooting their own parties in their two feet. These amendments are like a race to the bottom. Why should we not have retired judges? Why should we not have people who worked in the Judiciary for all their careers? Why should they not be on a commission? Why should we not use their years of practical experience? Sometimes people might not be all that delighted with judges' decisions but we must respect their decisions and the methods for coming to their conclusions nevertheless. Over the years, I have had the privilege of knowing District Court judges who gave years of sterling service and had a wealth of practical common sense experience under their belts.Those types of people would have an awful lot to offer when it comes to deciding on the very important decisions which need to be taken. Obviously I am not saying anything against lay people but it comes back to the point I was just getting at which was about political and judicial experience. If nothing else, who is a better driver, somebody who is doing 1,000 miles a month or somebody who is doing 10,000 miles a month? Is it not obvious that the more experience one has, the better one will be in the function or the role one is to perform? The Minister is again getting it from many people here tonight that this is a time for reflection. He and his colleagues should really stand back and look at the proceedings which have gone on here and think about what they are trying to do. We are not asking the Minister to collapse the Government. That would not be necessary. However, even at this late stage, there is time for the Minister to use his experience and to say that this is a nonsense. What the Minister and the Government are trying to do with this commission is actually nonsense. The Bill and the way it has proceeded in the last 48 hours has proven nothing more than farcical. Hearing some of the contributions, it seems to me that the hastily scrabbled together deal certainly leaves an awful lot to be desired. I heard today from people around the country who were watching the proceedings, including some from the Minister's own party, and many of them did not realise a deal had been made. Indeed the former Ceann Comhairle announced here last night that he knew nothing of it and he is a paid up member of the Minister's party. He did not know anything about the deal that the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet had made with Sinn Féin. Even he did not know about it. That is certainly treating members of the Minister's own parliamentary party with contempt in my opinion. We live in a democratic society. If the Minister's parliamentary party is cutting side deals to try to get to where it wants to go, surely to God it should have informed its own members rather than foisting it upon them in the way it did. Leaving Deputies such as Deputy Seán Barrett, who came in here last night having to say that he did not know what deal had been done because he had been out of the country on parliamentary business for a few days, in the lurch leaves an awful lot to be desired. If the Minister was to do the proper thing by himself, by the Government and, most importantly of all, by the people he was elected to serve, he would weigh this whole situation up and decide what he has to gain and what he has to lose. The credibility of what the Government is trying to do, as opposed to the Minister's personal credibility, lies in tatters tonight because of the events that have unfolded. It is never too late to say we are wrong, we have made a mistake and we are going to pull this Bill. The Minister should remember that Fianna Fáil keeps the Government in its position. It is not happy at the moment. I do not see why the Government should consider sinking itself just to pacify the one person who wants to drive this forward.

We have come back and the Ceann Comhairle has made a ruling. We are where we are but we are going around in circles. We are sending the Bill to the Seanad and expecting it to fix our problems. I know it will come back on Committee Stage here in the House but clearly we are sending out conflicting messages. One basic flaw is that we do not know whether there are going to be 13 members on this so-called board or 17 as the Minister, Deputy Ross, had been looking for. I do not know where the Minister is. I have called on him several times. He was here for the votes and he cleared out again like the flight of the earls. He was gone like a flash. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is afraid of contagion and does not want Deputy Ross near. I do not know what is going on but tá sé as láthair arís. He did not have the you-know-what to come in and marshal his own Bill, to be here for support or to be here to look at us or to make body language, gestures or whatever at us if he would not talk. He could write and talk all he wanted for decades in the newspapers and could solve everything, but now we have this Bill. This Bill changes little and does not address any real problem. That is my opinion. There is a real need for the legal profession to be reformed. I was in a technical group with him for five years before this present incarnation of the Government, and Deputy Ross had all kinds of ideas about what he could do and what he would not do. To be unfair to myself, jakers I believed him. I thought he was a bit of a whizz-kid and that he had the knowledge and expertise. I thought that he had friends in legal places, not including Deputy O'Callaghan, who would not have been here at that time, and that he knew what he was talking about. It now looks like he knew nothing about what he was talking about and was only making it up. He was a fake. It was fake news. He was here before President Trump ever came around. He had the fake news and the fake dreams. It was all fake. The real judicial problem is controlling the power of the King's Inns. I mean no disrespect to my learned friend from the King's Inns. I think Deputy Thomas Byrne might have gone through it as well. I have no problem with that. I have never been over there, I just look at it in awe.

It is all part of the reform of judicial services according to the infallible, inevitable, intolerable Minister, Deputy Ross. Both premises and organisations should be taken over by the State. They should be taken into public ownership and given to DIT, which is being centralised nearby at Grangegorman and is in need of extra premises. DIT is properly accountable to the State and its Legislature and it would be fitting for the Grangegorman campus to be enhanced by the inclusion of King's Inns and Blackhall Place in the context of both being brought under appropriate democratic control. It might be going somewhere then. We can have all the semantics we like here. We can have all the suggestions, motions, potions and God knows what else, but that is what we really should be doing. We should be reining in these two institutions which are a hangover from the British state and which are really not accountable to anyone. They are not accountable to this House or to anybody else. That is very serious. That is the kind of issue that should be in the Bill, not what the Minister is talking about. As I have said, DIT is properly accountable. I specify DIT because it is properly accountable but is also in that location near those premises. Universities and institutes of technology are accountable to the House through the Ministers and through legislation. We might then get some notice or response from the learned ladies and gentlemen in those institutions: Blackhall Place and King's Inns. I mean that. If the Bill was meaningful or if the Minister was interested he would have done that. He had the opportunity tonight to take back this Bill, to go that direction and to include that proposal or at least to discuss it with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality or ourselves. He could at least have talked to us about it. Legal education and the legal system would be removed from the elitist clutches of the two branches of the legal profession and placed in the properly accountable hands of third level institutions, such as universities, which are well capable of managing the task. In those universities we have boards, CEOs and people who are accountable and who can be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts. When do we ever see any of these learned institutions brought before any committee? We have certain people who were brought in before two committees that were fighting over which would get the first chaw at them. Deputy Alan Kelly was in there like a werewolf guffawing at people and wanting them in. When are these people going to come before any committees? When are they going to be in any way accountable to this House or in any way held responsible for any of the situations down there? We had the whole situation of justice delayed.They huffed and they puffed and they got a whole new appeals court, which I campaigned against and opposed, but we have seen little improvement. We saw some frantic action a few weeks ago - perhaps six weeks ago - to deal with cases. There were 150 per week, I believe. Other than that, people are waiting three to seven years for their cases to be heard. Justice delayed is justice denied. If the Minister, Deputy Ross, were serious, he would have brought in these people under a single professional institution and cut out all the pandering and elitism in the institutions in question. To the best of my knowledge, and unless someone can tell me otherwise, Dublin City Council maintains the area. The institutions do not even have to pay to cut the grass themselves. The legal practitioners are accorded an elite status as people we must look up to. I am not saying we should look down on them but we are supposed to look up to them and are expected to bow to them in their wigs and everything else. I am not against any of them, for that matter, but am saying the whole institution leads to elitism and a select culture. We are empowering them to go on. In this Legislature it is our duty, and the Minister's, to address this. The Minister was so ambitious and so anxious to reform the judicial system. Why start with the judicial system? Why not start with the legal profession? Many of those in that profession eventually become judges. I am not commenting on their fitness to be judges. The Government should start at the bottom and change the culture. First, it should examine the two institutions and have them shut down and placed under the auspices of one of the universities or some other body. I am not saying where but I am just suggesting DIT as it is located close to the two institutions. This is where the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, should have started if he had been really interested. He did not. He just came in here for media soundbites based on what he said he would do and the great man he was. Now he cannot be found. Tá sé as láthair arís. He is probably watching us on the television. If he is, I salute him and say hello to him, but why can he not come in here and acknowledge we are debating his mess, not that of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan?

The way things are going, we should not be talking at all. This Bill is about appointing people with knowledge to select judges, on whom we rely to mete out justice and give people a fair and balanced hearing. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board comprises the Chief Justice, who is the chairman, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister nominated by the Council of the Bar of Ireland, a practising solicitor nominated by the Law Society of Ireland, and no more than three persons appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is proposed that the chairman of the commission be a lay person. Also to be included are the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. At the end of the list is a reference to six lay members selected by the Public Appointments Service. The service must ensure a lay person will not be recommended for appointment as chairperson of the commission unless it is satisfied that he or she is a fit and proper person to be so appointed and is suitable for appointment having due regard to "his or her having demonstrated experience of effective board management and corporate governance". Who is going to check out all that? Why would someone in that capacity have gained as much knowledge as a judge, who would have operated as a solicitor or barrister before becoming a District Court judge or Circuit Court judge? The Public Appointments Service must also be satisfied as to "his or her having such experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate having regard to the functions of the Commission" and to "the desirability that he or she has knowledge of-----

The person appointed is supposed to have knowledge or experience of the operation of the courts. Who could have more knowledge than a judge or solicitor? Section 12 refers to the provision of supports to persons who are victims of crime or to users of the services provided by the courts. Again, who could know more about this than the judges, solicitors or barristers? Section 12 refers to "processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations". Who is going to decide who these people are? For over 100 years we had a system that served the country well. Why is it that we are changing it now because of the wishes of one man who wrote so much in the newspapers and whose idea it was that Governments and Ministers should not appoint judges anymore? Is it because of that? Is that why we are going to wreck the perfect justice system we have had for 100 years and throw it out the window? Is it just to satisfy one man and ensure his support for the Government? Surely nothing could be more ridiculous. Section 12(4) states the Public Appointments Service shall ensure that a lay person is recommended under subsection (2) for appointment as chairperson only if it is satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person to be so appointed and is suitable for appointment by reason of the person possessing such experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate having regard to the functions of the commission. Why are we doing this? Why is the Government allowing this to happen when it knows this is the most ridiculous Bill that has ever come before the House, in my time anyway? Members who are here longer than I am will say the very same thing. The Public Appointments Service is advised that the general scheme of the Bill contained a provision to the effect that, in appointing lay members to the commission, the Minister must have regard to the objective of having gender balance. That is fine but I believe knowledge and experience should come before deciding whether the person should be a man or woman. I have no objection to women but surely it should come down to experience, not just gender balance. It is absolutely ridiculous. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has just been replaced in the Chamber by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is also part of the Government. They are succumbing to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to ensure his support for the Government. It does not matter whether it is a good or bad Bill but, since it is the Bill of the latter Minister, the Government must support it. What is going on is ridiculous. I appeal to the Government to address this. In light of what happened last night, we do not know whether the commission will have 13 members or 17. We are talking in a vacuum.However, that is costing the taxpayers and I ask the Minister to do the proper thing and withdraw the Bill sooner rather than later because it will finish up in the courts. If the Bill ever becomes law, it will not happen for years when there will be a different Administration in this Chamber.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-23 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	431	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the amendments on the appointment of a chairperson and how the ordinary members will be appointed. The first thing that has to be cleared up is the fiasco that happened here last night when we did not know whether we were talking about 13 or 17 members. As a result of some sweetheart deals being done that seem to be getting even cosier in recent months, we have a Bill now that is neither here nor there. It is probably legally unsafe. It was voted on here last night. It will need a good deal of teasing out, although I suppose the cartels in the Seanad will work again to get it passed. Sooner or later, however, the day of reckoning will come, the Bill will not be right but people will be appointed. It should be noted that much of what judges have to work with around the country has been legislated on by Members in this House. They have guidelines on certain sentences and when they are criticised for being lenient, perhaps we should look at ourselves to see if we have given them too much scope in that regard. That is one area that needs to be examined. I have a fear that these so-called lay people on the commission will be retired county managers. To me, lay people are ordinary people. They are not people who have been in cosy jobs all their lives who move on when they retire to another bit of an income. As a State, we seem to have a woeful habit of doing things like that. I am not a lawyer. I never claimed to be one but, in fairness, the likes of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan would have a vast knowledge of the workings of this area and because of what he has gone through over the years in terms of experience, his views should be taken on board because a government is not able to push through every measure. It has to listen to others to make something better but I worry about the Minister, Deputy Ross, who is like the rabbit in the burrow. He is probably looking at the monitor in his office at the moment. He did not show up here at all. This is a measure to appease him in terms of getting a Bill through the Houses. It is to keep him quiet and keep the Government together for another few months but it is not doing it right. Ironically, there have been more judges appointed using the old method in the past two years than ever before even though the Minister's column in the newspapers would lead one to believe the position was much different. Once again, we are speaking out of both sides of our mouths. We need transparency and to make sure that judges are appointed properly. Everyone agrees with that but we need to make sure also that the educational side of it is not a cartel set up. We must be very clear that the Judiciary must be separate. They have to make their own decisions separate from everything else. When we look at appointments, and I am not just talking about the Judiciary, it was never someone farming in County Galway, County Kilkenny or elsewhere who got appointed. It was always a person in some public job. In terms of the process, a list is put before the Minister but he or she is nearly told what to do. To be honest, they are told what to pick. I do not see how we can make things better that way. As legislators, we need to make sure that we bring in something like a bill of quantum to provide guidelines on insurance cases. In terms of sentencing, day in, day out we hear about a judge who gave someone bail. However, that is not the judge's fault because as we have found out, under international law, if a judge does not give legal aid he or she is in trouble. They can be done for miscarriage of justice. The Attorney General has expressed his views on the Bill, which are alarming. The Attorney General is the Attorney General to the Government and everyone in that situation should be singing off the one hymn sheet. It is alarming that even though the Attorney General described the Bill in a few different ways some months ago, we are still powering ahead with it. The only reason I can see for doing that is to tick a little box that was a deal. It should not be about that. We can tick the box but we need to make sure we get the legislation right before we tick it. We must make sure that we take on board the views of Deputies here who have experience in the legal profession. I recognise that the Minister has a legal background but there are other people in the House who have vast experience in that regard. We need to make sure when we bring legislation before the House that it is right. We cannot have a repeat of the fiasco that happened here last night that, allegedly, will be sorted out in the Seanad. The Bill will then come back here and we will go around the merry-go-round again. That is not making progress or sending out the right signals. We need to get this Bill right and make sure that the appointment of people to the commission is done in a proper way and that the Judiciary is recognised as well.

I again ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to consider standing back on this issue. The nation is watching very closely and they saw the shambles that went on here last night. If his Government has its hand tied behind its back by the Minister, Deputy Ross, I plead with Sinn Féin to release the ties of the Fine Gael Ministers and TDs and call a halt to this mess. I know it is not a mess that Sinn Féin intended but it has happened and it is before the people at this time. From what I can see, and I have to be careful in what I say, the Minister, Deputy Ross, is holding the Government against its will on this issue. There is only one party that can call a halt to that and that is Sinn Féin. It can make him put this Bill in the bin, restart it and face the people. I referred earlier to a text the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, sent me following a vote in a previous debate in which he indicated his frustration that I did not support the Bill. I outlined my concerns to him at that very early stage and now they are justified because this is a complete mess. It is an embarrassment for our country and for our Government and anyone who is supporting it on this Bill. In terms of whether it will be a 13 person or a 17 person commission appointed by the Government, we are back to square one. It is like a quango. Will it be a little job for the boys? Will we be sitting here in a couple of years from now saying that these appointments are questionable and asking whether it was Fine Gael or Sinn Féin and who supported it?It is time for us to pull back. There is no doubt that there needs to be reform in some respects. On many occasions, I have raised the case of a gentleman in my constituency who, since 2005, has gone through the court process since 2005 and who has been treated extremely poorly. This man has endured a lot of ill health because of a case brought against him by a semi-State body that had plenty of money to do so. The bottom line is this man feels justified in his view that there was no court registrar on the day of the court case. I raised this case with the Minister, who is not here but who has heard me discuss it on the floor of the House previously. He is not to blame because he was not there. I fully accept that. However, I pleaded with him to work with this gentleman to find out whether there was a registrar and what procedure was used, regardless of the efforts made by this man to find out whether there was a registrar in the court because if there was none, it means the court proceedings were null and void on the day. Nobody to whom I have written in this Government can provide that man with a course of action - a road he can travel or a person to whom he can go to find this out. To me, it stinks to high heaven of a cover up because if there was honesty and transparency, which should exist in these situations, they would be able to say who the registrar was, when he or she was there and who was paid to come on the day but nobody is able to supply him with that information no matter how many times he has gone through the courts to try to resolve that.  We need to reform our judicial system but a 17 or 13-person commission is not the way forward. It is just another job for the boys. There has been discussion here about whether it will cost €1 million. It might only cost €500,000. That is a huge amount of money for people who are struggling. Members of the public watching the debate last night and tonight are not happy with the parties that continue to support this Bill, which is faltering all around them. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is on a little ego trip. I would plead with the Minister to talk to each and every member of the Government and say that enough is enough and that it will not be part of this charade. It has definitely been found that there are major questions about it. There has been doubt among the public that there was an issue here and last night proved that there was. It is time to step back, govern decisively and not be led by somebody on an ego trip. It has put us in a very serious situation. I do not know how many Deputies have spoken to the Government tonight. They have been very consistent about the way they have said this will go. They have pleaded with the Government to pull back but to date it has refused to do so. The body language of those opposite does not give me the impression that the Government really supports this. It is being carried along by the hand. It is a case of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or the country. Sometimes democracy and standing by the people are far better than standing by a man on an ego trip. As we said earlier, he could write about the Minister in a few months' time and tear him to bits about what he did in this Bill, that Bill and the other Bill. Today, he is backing the Government but the pen is heavier than the sword and he will be back with the pen again fairly soon. I ask the Minister to listen to the public. There is an outcry. We are all human. Many mistakes have been made here along the way and last night proved that. The Government has an opportunity to overturn that and govern the way a Government should govern and not continue to support somebody who is fighting a losing battle on this issue.

I have not spoken on this Bill in recent times, although I spoke initially. What struck me when I looked at it in the first instance was that we were going down a very populist road based on populism rather than on evidence. I have the distinct feeling that the Minister has to be cringing given his own background and the very valid arguments made here by various Deputies. I feel for him and would not like to be in his position because there is no rational basis for the changes proposed here. When I went back to my first speech, I looked at the system that was in place. On many occasions, the members of the existing board made recommendations and called on the Government and, indeed, were instrumental in asking, for reform to stop political interference. This was the judges themselves appealing to successive Governments to stop the political interference. They put it slightly differently when they spoke about ensuring that there was less interference from the Government and more independence. Here we are today. On top of no evidence for the change and no evidence for the cost of it - the Government cannot tell us what it will cost, although the existing board is doing it on a very tight budget - we are here today and we do not even know the make up of the commission in terms of numbers. Is 17 or 13? We do not know. We have a Minister pushing this for his own motives when I can think of many things he could be doing as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. On a personal basis, I like the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport but he should focus on the job he has. The Minister's job is to be courageous enough to say the Government cannot go through with this Bill in its current form and to embrace the amendments that have been put forward. I have sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for just over two years. I must declare that I am a former member of the Bar. I will come back to many problems with the Bar but they certainly do not involve the Judiciary. Watching public body after public body and different organisations appear before the committee over the past two and a half years, which are experts in the language of corporate governance, procedures and processes and yet where there is no accountability, I cringe when I read that language.Despite the limitations of the appointments system, the Judiciary has gone up in my estimation as courageous and independent-minded. I am delighted that the gender balance is improving all the time. As Deputy Wallace has pointed out, that what is proposed in the Bill would allow for more political interference in the type of people appointed. As Deputy Fitzmaurice pointed out, we could get more local authority chief executives and men or women of that type. In this Bill we are not looking for people who can think independently, can stand up and say exactly what is wrong or right without fear or favour. A substantial number of the problems with the legal profession relate to the limited access for people at point of entry and the scandalous cost of legal education in both branches - solicitors and barristers - something the Minister should look at. The Minister should address the lack of guidelines on sentencing. We could take serious action to address the lack of support for victims in court who are left wandering around courthouses without assistance and are brought in simply as witnesses. I briefly mentioned the Public Appointments Service. I have absolutely no confidence in section 12 which provides that the Public Appointments Service would also pick the chairperson. At the very least, good governance would dictate that the commission would determine who the chairperson would be on merit. I have an open mind as to who should be chair; my preference obviously would be for a member of the Judiciary given my experience. However, the chair should definitely be picked by the commission. Judges' lack of training could be addressed very quickly. Access to courts is too costly for ordinary people. Members of the Judiciary have frequently said that the ordinary person without resources has very limited access to the courts. All of these are urgent issues the Government should address: they should have been addressed by the previous Government. Instead we are introducing the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which is simply not fit for purpose. More than that, it is twisting language on its head. I am disappointed that Sinn Féin is colluding with this type of misuse of language. It is suggested that it will bring more openness and accountability into the appointment of judges when the very opposite will occur. There is no analysis of what we have learnt from the weaknesses and faults of the existing system. Most of all we have utterly failed to recognise that the members of the Judiciary have been the most vocal in calling for changes to the existing system, not the Minister, Deputy Ross. When the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, deals with the fact that he is most uncomfortable with what is being proposed, I ask him to take courage in his hands and to learn. He will make his mark in history if he stands up and says, "We've made a mistake, but we're going to stop and not persist with this mistake."

Lay people looking in at what happens in the Dáil Chamber must be amused on the one side and saddened on the other side at what has gone on. Certain people have been dealt a very poor hand by the Judiciary. I mentioned this earlier and I will give a bit more detail now. As we are debating a Bill dealing with reform that is needed in how we appoint judges - I take the previous speaker's point that members of the Judiciary also want reform and have asked for it - a woman, Yvonne Walsh, is in the Dóchas Centre having been sent there to purge her contempt of court. She has two children sitting their exams. She cannot purge her contempt because she does not have the power to do it. She has been in jail for nearly 21 days. She has been deprived of her human rights. She has no access to email. She is a lay-litigant. She cannot take the steps to get herself out of jail.

Where is the justice for that woman and her family? Will the Minister intervene in that case? The answer to that is probably "No" because they are on one side and we are on the other. However, there has to be room for an intervention where something goes seriously wrong. It is wrong that that should happen to this woman fighting for her family home. I ask the Minister seriously to intervene in that case and determine how she might be helped. There is a whole litany of differences in terms of the Judiciary, court orders and information made available to judges in the death of Shane O'Farrell. His mother, Lucia O'Farrell, has repeatedly pleaded with Members of this House, but to no avail. Where the justice system fails someone so badly and there is an abundance of proof that Lucia O'Farrell is correct, there should be an intervention.

Earlier I asked the Minister to withdraw the Bill because it is nonsense. He is imposing a cost of €1 million on the Exchequer. He is creating a commission that will be appointed by another quango - one quango appointing another quango with the authorisation of the Minister. Where is political responsibility in this debate? Where is Government direction in this debate? Where is justice in the debate? It is not present. We are discussing one political system replacing another flawed political system. When the Minister gets three names on a piece of paper from this very expensive quango and one of them is known as a Fine Gael supporter, I doubt he will look at the other two. I am surprised at Sinn Féin, which might have extracted something through its support for the Government Bill and it may benefit people going through the system. However, surely Deputy Ó Laoghaire must be ashamed at what is going on here this evening, and what happened yesterday and on the previous day. The Minister has brought this Bill to the House with so many issues that we cannot even add up the number of members of the commission.

Given that the Minister knows the system, I cannot understand why he will not be man enough to withdraw the Bill and bring back a perfected Bill which can be properly debated before it goes to the Seanad or anywhere else. The committee members have done their work. We have come across a problem with last night's votes and we should be big enough as legislators to say that we will not pursue this defective Bill and that we will perfect it in such a way to bring it back in - even with Sinn Féin's support. We need a perfected Bill with the flaws taken out of it and issues dealt with to make it stronger legislation should it ever be contested outside this House.

Lucia O'Farrell wants justice. Yvonne Walsh wants justice. She is languishing in jail this evening, after 21 days, and she cannot fulfil what the judge has asked her to do because it is not within her power to do it. Still the State stands idly by and watches that woman in jail, with her two children about to do their junior certificate exams. What a disgusting spectacle when a Government stands to one side and gives such huge time to debating this Bill. It is not right and the Minister knows it is not right, but he will not take the sensible and proper decision in terms of administration by withdrawing the Bill and perfecting it. I believe, at the end of this, we will still be back here next week or the week after, debating the same thing over and over again. Each and every one of us knows it is an absolute farce the way it is being put through this House. I appeal to the Minister again to withdraw the Bill, perfect it and bring it back.

He will be aware from my amendments how best I see the composition question on the commission being approached. Under my amendments lay members will be drawn from the Public Appointments Service process, as will the chairperson, similar to the Deputy's own view. IHREC will nominate its own lay person. I made the point before in regard to the Deputy's approach that his amendments would make it difficult for the comprehensive framework of knowledge and experience in subsection (7) to be referenced. If the Public Appointments Service was confined to only making a small number of selections from these categories of experience and knowledge, I believe we would risk losing valuable inputs in the appointments framework. I am concerned that by narrowing the selection of lay people under Deputy Ó Laoghaire's approach, we are losing out on important inputs. Deputy Charles Flanagan: Amendment No. 29 is in the name of Deputy Ó Laoghaire. The Deputy will be aware how best I see the composition question on the commission being approached. Lay members will be drawn from the Public Appointments Service process, as will the chairperson, similar to the Deputy's own view of that. IHREC will nominate its own lay person, which we have touched on already. I made the point before, in regard to the Deputy's approach, that his amendments would make it difficult for the framework of knowledge and experience in subsection (7) to be referenced, in particular if the Public Appointments Service was confined to only making a small number of selections from these categories of experience and knowledge. I believe we could risk losing valuable inputs in the appointments framework. I am concerned that, by narrowing the selection of lay people under Deputy Ó Laoghaire's approach, we are losing out on critical inputs. I believe amendment No. 30, in the name of Deputy Daly, undermines the position of the selection of the chair given there are specific requirements in section 12 underscoring the special position of the chairperson. I am concerned about that and, therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. With regard to amendments Nos. 31 to 36, inclusive, these are in Deputy Daly's name and in my name, so perhaps they can be taken together. I can defer to Deputy Daly in respect of them but Deputies will be aware these are merely necessary tidying-up amendments that make it clear that the relevant position as set out in section 12(5)(a), (b) and (c) can relate only to the lay members. Those provisions concern the three objectives set out in the subsection, that is, knowledge and experience of the matters set out in subsection (7) and the objectives relating to having an equal number of women and men and the diversity of the population as a whole. Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 together remove from subsection (5)(a) the reference to the members of the commission appointed pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f) and (h) of section 10. In other words, it deletes references to the practising barrister, practising solicitor and lay members but realigns the wording to relate only to the lay members. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 serve the exact same purpose in respect of subsection (5)(b). Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 repeat the process in respect of subsection (5)(c). On amendments Nos. 37, 39 and 41, the fundamentals of section 12(7) are retained because these will be essential to the success of these measures. It acknowledges the pivotal role of the Public Appointments Service as the acknowledged leading recruiter for the public service in the State and that it will manage the process. My proposed amendments Nos. 37, 39 and 41 are on the criteria set out in section 12(7). On amendment No. 37, in Deputy Daly's name and in my name, Deputy Daly has spoken on this and I am with her on it. In amendment No. 39 I am seeking to reinsert in the Bill the words therein which were deleted by the committee, and the position is similar in amendment No. 41. I can accept amendment No. 40 in the name of Deputies Daly and Wallace. With regard to amendment No. 39, I do not believe the reference to "administration" should be dropped as I believe it was an important part of the composition under the current Judicial Appointments Board. I can think of very many public and other institutions which, and, indeed, also eminent individuals with an administrative background in the public or private sphere who, could make a very substantial contribution to what the commission will be seeking to achieve. With regard to Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 43, I am aware we separately have similar requirements in section 12. I think we will need another member who will be more familiar with board procedure and governance. It may well come into play in a situation where the chairperson's role, for example, needs to be filled on a temporary basis. On amendment No. 38, in the name of Deputies Daly and Wallace, apart from the actual recommendation function of the commission, the members will be required to engage in a substantial manner with procedures, practice and policies. This trait is captured in paragraph (e) and I believe it is important. As a result of that, I have a difficulty with amendment No. 38, which seeks to remove that. I caution against it. My amendment No. 42 proposes the deletion of subsection (8), which I believe is superfluous as subsection (5) already mandates the Public Appointments Service in selecting the lay persons to have regard to the diversity issue and the equal number of men and women objectives. I am not sure that it needs to be repeated at this stage. Amendment No. 43 is consequential on Deputy O'Callaghan's preference as to the manner of securing the chair of the commission, which we discussed in the previous grouping. I have a difficulty with that approach.

I want to concentrate on the last points concerning our amendment No. 38 and its intention to delete that lay members of the commission would have knowledge of the "processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations", as well as the Minister's attempt to reinsert what the committee voted down, reinstating "board membership and corporate governance" as some of the skills that lay people might possess. We think it is critical that amendment No. 38 be accepted and amendment No. 41 be voted down. I will give a relatively recent example where similar criteria were laid down in terms of board membership, corporate governance and public sector administration, as these were already included as two of the four matters that the Public Appointments Service must have regard to when selecting commissioners for IHREC in accordance with section 13(5) of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014. As a result of those two clauses, in a recent competition for IHREC commissioners by the Public Appointments Service, we had the exclusion from even an interview of Michael Farrell, the eminently qualified senior solicitor with FLAC, a lifelong social justice campaigner and a human rights consultant. He could not even get an interview for that panel because of those criteria being in place.We have all made huge points to the effect that, if we want lay involvement to represent society as a whole, we do not want to have cloned versions of politicians, civil servants and big business. We want real diversity and of the two amendments, one must be passed and the other defeated if we are to have the necessary balance.

We are seeking to identify the characteristics and eligibility of the lay persons who are to be appointed to the commission the Minister wishes to establish. I will be supporting amendment No. 30 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly because it seeks to remove section 12(4). The subsection refers to how people who are to be appointed to the board as lay persons must display certain characteristics. The first is that they must be a fit and proper person, which goes without saying. It also states they should have demonstrated experience of effective board management and corporate governance. That is legal-speak for getting people appointed who have served on boards of Irish plcs or other private or public company boards. I do not have any objection to these individuals, but I have a concern that we will find ourselves in a situation where appointments to the judicial commission will be similar to appointments made to Irish plcs. It will be the same group of individuals who were appointed by friends to other groups and the State will see that they are very respectable and knowledgeable, with great knowledge of board management and corporate governance. Anyone who sits on a board can say he or she has knowledge of board management; it does not even matter which board it was. It is a dangerous provision to insert as we do not want people coming from private companies or plcs onto the board to bulk up their CVs and enable them to say they served for four or five years on the judicial appointments commission. It is about insiders and we need to be careful about what the Public Appointments Service is doing. I am surprised that the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, is supporting this as he used to rail against insiders appointing friends to other plcs

I am against the notion that we will legislate to encourage the Public Appointments Service to pick lay members from the section of society whose members are part of the status quo and do not challenge the powers that be. We were looking for fresh thinking and to come up with a commission that would represent the people of Ireland to a greater degree. I am confident that members of the Judiciary would be a lot more objective in selecting individuals they see fit to become judges than the people who come from these organisations who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. God help us - have we learned anything from how this society runs? There is a merry-go-round of individuals who have a certain dominance of power in Ireland. They have had a foothold here and this building, Leinster House, is overrun by lobbyists and people with influence who have an impact on how legislation is structured. One example is the REITs that were set up, which were outrageous. We created a situation where investment funds from abroad bought up stressed properties, used them in the rental market and paid no tax on the income.

Sometimes, when one is a Minister in the Cabinet, one becomes detached from what people are saying on the ground, although I do not say that of the Minister for Justice and Equality. He is, however, making a sacrificial lamb of himself in this folly by standing over something that is not worth standing over. This is a farce and a shambles. A lot of the Members on my right have been here for far longer that I have been and I always listen to people who have been around for longer than I have been. I am hearing from them and people left, right and centre that this is wrong. I call on the Minister to wake up, smell the roses and realise he is backing a losing horse in this Bill. It has to be withdrawn and if he does not do so today, or tomorrow, it will happen eventually because people will realise he is making a major mistake. It would be prudent and smart to withdraw it, even at this late stage. I plead with him, in the the interests of common sense, to do so. One can have all of the education in the world, but one cannot beat common sense. The people watching are asking what, in the name of God, are we doing and trying to achieve. Why is everybody debating an issue when the Minister who is proposing it is not even here? The Minister for Justice and Equality should demand of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that he be present to hear our concerns. Every one of us has been elected to do a job and it is only right and proper that the Minister be here to hear the debate.

It refers to elitist boards such as those of plcs and their friends on the board of the Public Appointments Service and everybody else.

We should be talking about Ms Yvonne Walsh and getting her freed to go back to her family in a crucial time in their lives. That is what we should be fighting and working for here, and we are not. I refer to something I have been speaking about for a long time, the gentleman in Skibbereen who has had no justice for the last 13 years. No one here can tell me or that man how he can get justice and find out if there was a register in the court on that day. That has been overlooked completely. We continue to overlook important issues while we are sorting out the dream of the Minister, Deputy Ross. His dream is turning into a nightmare. He is in hiding. I have no doubt if he is down in west Cork, he is probably down in one of those potholes that he failed to provide funding for. A sum of €500,000 was spoken of. There is a bridge in Lyre in Clonakilty that needs €500,000 to be rebuilt since 2013 so that people can travel on the road. That €500,000 could repair the roads but the same Minister is not doing so. We should not be discussing this Bill. It should be in the bin.

We have debated the desirability of a legal or non-legal chair. My approach is to have a non-legal chair for reasons that have been well amplified both during the course of this debate and earlier. If we are having a non-legal chair, it is eminently appropriate that the non-legal chair is a person who is specially and appropriately qualified for the job. My concern is that the deletion of subsection (4) will take away important attributes that an expert chair should have. I refer to experience, effective management, qualifications, training, expertise and the desirability that he or she has knowledge of and experience in the matters to be specified. I accept the points raised by Deputy Clare Daly but I do not agree with them. From that perspective, if we were to agree this amendment or if I were to accept it, I would be considerably and overly narrowing the important position of the chair of the judicial appointments commission. That is especially the case since at this stage we appear to be moving towards that person being a non-judicial figure or a non-legal figure. That is all the more reason there should be expertise.

The issues at stake here are about the chair of the commission. We were trying to allow the members of the committee themselves to decide the chair, removing that function from the Public Appointments Service, PAS. On the section the Minister referred to, I will not repeat all of the points made earlier but it is expertise in effective board management and corporate governance. The Minister said he does not agree with me. It is not me he is disagreeing with, however, but with the entire Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. It voted to remove this criterion on Committee Stage. It was the will of all of the Opposition. The other Deputies have articulated the points very well so there is no point in me dealing with that. It is not, however, about a non-legal chair. It is about the process of how the chair would be appointed and what type of a person the chair should be. We are allowing for the group to appoint its own chair but also ensuring that he or she does not come from the elite area we are trying to break up, refresh and in which to have something different. We honestly think the people on the commission are best placed to decide among themselves how that might be done. We are talking about a new approach. We are trying to have a representation from broader society but yet the wording here replicates criteria used on many other similar bodies. It is entirely inappropriate in this instance.
