          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_10">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I understand from Mr. Justice Barron that he has almost completed the drafting of his report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which also includes consideration of other events including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976 and the murders of John Francis Green and Bríd Carr and he expects his report to be ready for publication after the summer. I also understand that Mr. Justice Barron considers that he has the resources necessary to complete his work. He has not indicated his intention to make an interim report. The cost of the commission to date this year amounts to approximately €398,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I have received correspondence from the group, Justice for the Forgotten, urging that in discussions on the peace process, the needs of victims to know the truth as to the circumstances of their loss or injury be given full recognition, and asking that the two Governments and parties to the Good Friday Agreement commit themselves to the establishment of public inquiries where the truth as to the cause and circumstances of atrocities cannot otherwise be obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">At Weston Park, both Governments acknowledged that certain cases from the past remained a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion by the security forces. Subsequently, Mr. Justice Peter Cory agreed to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in the cases of the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright. If Mr. Justice Cory considers that in any case a public inquiry is required, the relevant Government will implement that recommendation. With regard to any other public inquiries into other incidents or events, I believe it would be best to await Mr. Justice Cory's report and recommendations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I am grateful to the Taoiseach. When he says that the report is almost completed, could he indicate why it has taken so long? He gave the same answer on 22 April last year when he said that the report would be completed in autumn 2002. Is the Taoiseach aware of any of the reasons for the delay in completion? Has it to do with lack of co-operation from the British authorities or are areas still outstanding in which co-operation from those authorities is less than it might be? Does the Taoiseach know if Mr. Justice Barron will make specific findings, reach specific conclusions or make particular recommendations? When the Taoiseach receives the report, is it still his intention to refer it in the first instance to the appropriate Oireachtas committee?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_15">It remains my intention that the report, when received, will be immediately referred to the appropriate Oireachtas committee where it will be examined. The latest indication is that we will have the report in September. It will then be referred to the committee, which could consider it straight away when it resumes its work in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I am not sure how Mr. Justice Barron intends to write up his report. I imagine he will try to give as much detail as he can, whether in the form of recommendations or further actions, on the manner in which we could proceed. The delay can be attributed to the ongoing nature of the deliberations, and the difficulties encountered by the British Government in acquiring the data. The Irish Government did everything it could to deal with this issue. There were direct dealings between Mr. Justice Barron and the British authorities through the NIO, the British Government and its agencies. We will have to wait for the report to see if Mr. Justice Barron is entirely happy with that co-operation, but no matters are currently outstanding at this stage. This is not to say that Mr. Justice Barron got everything he wanted as that might be an over-optimistic assessment. We will have to wait and see the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The delay in publication can also be attributed to the fact that the team working with Mr. Justice Barron continued to follow through on the various issues. It spent considerable time consulting the records of this House, those of the Garda and those they received through the co-operation of the NIO and the British authorities. The team also followed up other related matters, as we in this House had asked them to do. We asked them not to confine their investigations to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but to look at other cases, some of which were related to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings while others were on a different track. The team spent a good deal of time on those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The end result is that we have dealt with all the outstanding cases. I am not aware of the situation in this regard and I do not want to give the impression that I am so aware. Mr. Justice Barron is not briefing me directly on this issue. I only know that he is at the final stages of drafting the report. I hope it will be printed and circulated in the House in September. I made it clear that is what I want. I do not want to go further, if that is possible, and I understand that will be possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">As regards the Remembrance Fund which was announced yesterday, when will the members of the commission be appointed? Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate to the House when the families concerned may expect payments to be made. Will he also indicate the scope or parameters of eligibility in that regard? Has the Government given consideration to reopening the Garda investigation, given the dissatisfaction expressed publicly by the relatives and families of those affected about the Garda investigation at the time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_20">As regards the Remembrance Fund, I announced a few months ago that €3 million would be provided this year to address the needs of the victims in this jurisdiction of the conflict in Northern Ireland and it will be administered through the Remembrance Fund. I understand the trustees of that fund will be announced shortly by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Last week we agreed the proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the administration of the fund. Those proposals will be proceeded with as a matter of urgency. Yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met Justice for the Forgotten and he outlined the basis on which the payments will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The payments involve acknowledgement payments of €15,000 to bereaved families or persons who were either killed in this jurisdiction or were resident in this jurisdiction at the time of their death, lump sums to spouses and dependent children of victims who were killed in this jurisdiction or resident here at the time of their death and injured victims, subject to the condition that amounts do not exceed €15,000 per applicant. Unless already covered by payments under the previous category, unmet and continuing medical costs and vouched medical expenses will be covered, including some health expenses not already paid for by another body or State agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">There is an allocation of payments up to €15,000, subject to conditions, to people who had to move as a direct consequence of the conflict in Northern Ireland and the payment of a grant to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund. There is also payment for the counselling needs of persons in this jurisdiction who were injured as a direct result of the conflict in Northern Ireland. This will be met by the health boards or the victim support groups, such as Justice for the Forgotten. Provision has been made in the Estimates for this purpose. The Government has approved expenditure of €9 million over the expected three year period of the fund. It is expected the commission will be in a position to seek applications for payments under the various categories of the proposed scheme later in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I referred to ongoing medical expenses. A number of people, although not many, are still in receipt of ongoing medical treatment. A few individuals are still having shrapnel removed from their bodies. A case was highlighted recently where an individual had shrapnel removed from the knee and elbow, and there have been a few other similar cases. They will receive assistance because they have not received aid up to now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_24">Will payments be made to people other than the immediate relatives concerned in the particular bombings?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_25">No, other than those categories I mentioned, namely, the relatives of people who have been directly injured or killed or those receiving ongoing medical treatment. Some of those who are receiving medical treatment may not necessarily have been injured in the bombing but they suffered different ailments afterwards or were traumatised in one form or another and continued to have difficulties over the years. There is a small number of them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_26">On 17 May 1974, 33 people lost their lives – 26 in Dublin city centre and seven in Monaghan. The purpose of the Barron inquiry is to determine whether British security forces colluded with the UVF in those attacks. It is probably difficult for anybody in the House or for our predecessors to appreciate the pain that lingers among the members of the Justice for the Forgotten group when they do not know what happened or the reasons for the deaths of their loved ones and so on. The publication of the Stevens report and the "Stakeknife" episode adds further confusion and pain to the memories of the people in the Justice for the Forgotten Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">A sizeable proportion of people in surveys carried out in Britain recently, for whatever reason, do not trust the British Prime Minister in regard to the truth. I do not say whether that is the reality. Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with the British Prime Minister on Friday in Greece when he meets him at the EU leaders' summit? Will he remind him that Mr. Justice Barron expects to publish his report by September and that he will be unhappy if he does not have it out by September? Will he urge him again to make sure all the information relevant to the report is given by the British authorities to Mr. Justice Barron so that the central fact of collusion between the British forces and the UVF in 1974 may be apparent?</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The inquest will resume symbolically on Friday but it will not have practical effect until following the publication of the Barron inquiry report. The case of one of the victims of the Monaghan bombing was not concluded and the inquest will re-open on that case. Does the Taoiseach consider from his sources of information that there is justification in calling for an expansion of that inquest in that other victims of the bombings may, in justice and in equity, feel the inquest should also resume in the cases of their loved ones?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I reiterate that we have gone through a long process of trying to get additional information from various sources within the British establishment and that has been completed. Mr. Justice Barron will make his views known on whether that was entirely satisfactory but I will not re-open that issue. We went through a long period of trying to get the information and set up meetings with him between various individuals. His team held those meetings and we will have to wait to see what Mr. Justice Barron states about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">On the inquest, I have spent a great deal of time on all these cases over the years, including all the cases that we have referred to Judge Cory's inquiry. There are different views about what happened and why it happened but the House should understand the circumstances. In the Troubles of Northern Ireland at that stage atrocities were being committed practically on a daily basis. There was plenty of speculation about collusion at the time of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which I remember well. It was strongly believed at the time that there was collusion but the question was trying to prove it. These issues were dealt with at a remove and I have spent long hours talking to the families over many years. However, the reality is the Barron inquiry has been our first real attempt to find and go through all the information to see where we get.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">With regard to the Garda investigation, about which Deputy Rabbitte asked me earlier, I informed the families five or six years ago of my information about that. I found it extraordinary that the Garda investigation into the biggest atrocity in the South during the entire period of the troubles was opened and closed within a year. The position with the inquests was similar. They opened on 27 May 1974 and the death certificates were issued, and they were not held again. That is extraordinary. We must look at what was in the minds of people at the time, who were concerned with other issues. The findings of the Garda investigation have been available to Mr. Justice Barron. We must await the report of the Barron tribunal and see where we can go from there. There is no point in my trying to second guess that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">When delegations from Northern Ireland ask me to look at individual cases I am advised that if we were to open all those cases, involving various groups and including the security elements, we would never achieve trust and confidence. I have views on that question which I may express when the Barron and Cory inquiries have been completed. I am frequently asked, by all sides, not to go down the road of inquiry. They may not ask publicly but they certainly do so privately. We must try to get to the end of the Barron and Cory inquiries. If we were to investigate every case and establish public inquiries it would create much difficulty, perhaps not now but for the next 20 or 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We are committed to completing the Barron inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and related cases and the Cory inquiry into the cases which were agreed in Weston Park, and we should complete those. I hope that in some of those cases there will be sufficient evidence and new information to justify full inquiries. I have always felt particularly strongly about the Pat Finucane case and I believe there is a large amount of evidence to justify an inquiry into it. However, that evidence must stand up and when Mr. Justice Cory reports in the autumn we will see that evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">The Garda investigation opened in 1974 and closed n 1975, and that sounds extraordinary now. The coroner issued death certificates in 1974 and then, effectively, the case was closed. In recent years I have asked myself why those events were not investigated. Mr. Justice Barron will review those records. I can only imagine that so many other atrocities were happening at the time that it was thought that the investigation could not be brought further. That seems strange when one looks back at what happened in 1975 and 1976 but those are the decisions that were made. The investigations were not subsequently reopened and successive Governments did not so request until we began to look at the question again in 1998 after the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Let us wait for the findings of Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry and examine them in this House. Let us also look at Mr. Justice Cory's report when it is made.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_36">I thank the Taoiseach for his forthrightness in this reply. It is of critical importance that everything is done to determine the facts of what occurred so that people will know whether there was collusion between the British security forces and the UVF, and why 33 people lost their lives in 1974.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Assuming Mr. Justice Cory and Mr. Justice Barron bring in their reports on time and given the Taoiseach's personal interest in this matter, if either inquiry finds evidence that would require the reopening of the Garda inquiry here will he be prepared to follow through on that and order such a reopening? It seems extraordinary that the Garda inquiry finished up in 1975 at very short notice. I ask the Taoiseach to reiterate the importance of this matter when he meets Prime Minister Blair on Friday – perhaps he will confirm that he will at least mention it to the Prime Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_38">I know Deputy Kenny is not suggesting this but if I say I will not open up that inquiry, it will seem I am not prepared to do so. I am prepared to do anything to get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">On the lapse of time, the extensive records which existed were examined. Therefore, it was not that the Garda Síochána did nothing, but its members obviously brought it to a particular stage. In the circumstances which probably existed at the time, they may have felt they would not get any further and other events probably took over.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">At least substantial information exists and the Garda has totally co-operated and been very helpful in all of this. As the Deputy can imagine, 26 or 27 years later no one involved in those investigations at any level remains but people, within and outside this jurisdiction, came forward to Mr. Justice Barron, and to Mr. Justice Hamilton in the first instance, and therefore they have had the benefit of all that information. I am not a legal person and cannot say whether this will stand up. Unless I am entirely wrong, as I have said time and again to the British authorities and in this House, there was collusion in the Pat Finucane case. Again, the question is whether this will stand up. I will be very disappointed – but I will have to accept it because that is what I agreed to do – if Mr. Justice Cory does not opt for a public inquiry in the Pat Finucane case, and perhaps in other cases also. We will have to await that decision but we will know soon enough. In fact, Mr. Justice Cory is finished a number of his reports and those reports are now being held pending the completion of all the reports which he wants to present to both Governments. We will just have to wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">There has been recent evidence about Rosemary Nelson which Stevens must further investigate. Loyalist paramilitary people have stated that members of the then RUC offered to treat them in a particular way if they were to look at some of the people who were causing them problems. These are serious allegations and must also be examined by Stevens. I have made no comment about Stakeknife because, frankly, I do not have sufficient evidence although I have heard plenty about him. I honestly do not know what is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I have been assured that Mr. Justice Barron will complete his work over the summer and I still believe Mr. Justice Cory, whose work has been delayed by a few weeks because his wife has been ill, will finish his report in the autumn.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_43">Given that the Taoiseach has described the period between the opening and closing of the Garda investigation at the time as being extraordinarily brief, is he aware whether Mr. Justice Barron has pursued this issue with the members of the then coalition Government and, if so, has he received full co-operation from the members of that Government in this inquiry and on that specific question in which they must have had quite a deep interest?</p>
          <p eId="para_44">On the meeting due to be held this Friday with the coroner on the arrangements for the resumption of the inquest, there appears to be an issue regarding co-operation with the police authority in the North of Ireland. On any resumption of the inquest, which I understand will take place following the publication of the Barron report, will the Taoiseach ensure that steps are taken to ensure full co-operation and that wherever co-operation is sought, such a request will have the full backing of the Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The Taoiseach has referred to Mr. Justice Cory's investigation. If Mr. Justice Cory recommends the need for a public inquiry into the murders he is investigating, does the Taoiseach agree that would at the very least add to the case being made by the relatives of the Dublin and Monaghan victims for a full public inquiry following the publication of the Barron report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_13">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_46">We will give full co-operation and assistance in the matter of the inquest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_47">The issue is whether there will be full co-operation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and that it will give whatever information is sought by the inquest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_15">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_48">I believe it will. The new Chief Constable, Mr. Orde, has been very co-operative. I do not think there will be a difficulty. I believe they will co-operate if they have any data and records and we will endeavour to ensure that co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The Garda investigation does not have anything to do with the Government. It was a Garda operational matter and the Garda would have dealt with it on that basis. The Garda conducted the investigation but the circumstances of the time were different and it was probably thought that the investigation would not get any further. That information has been made available to Mr. Justice Barron. He has spoken to the Garda. I have not been directing his investigation. The Government appointed him to do a job and both he and the late Mr. Justice Hamilton have expended an extraordinary amount of effort and commitment on the job. The only area in which the inquiry was assisted by the Government was when we were asked to facilitate them by opening doors through contacts with the Garda Síochána or Departments, the Northern Ireland Office, the British Government or the security system. In each case we used our good offices to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The Garda investigation at the time was an operational matter. Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry has been able to follow those issues through. The period of time in question saw many events and issues happening in this jurisdiction, including many atrocities. The Garda investigating teams would have been involved in the investigation of those events. We must await the publication of Mr. Justice Barron's report to see whether he was given all the co-operation he required.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_51">Like Deputy Gregory, I picked up on the comment made by the Taoiseach that the suspension of the inquest is extraordinary. Given that it was the largest act of mass murder in the history of the State, it is implausible to state that the inquest was suspended because it could not be progressed any further. Is that the most plausible reason the Government can give? I know there was trauma at the time. I was caught up in it but luckily, I was not injured. Is it acceptable to say that it could not be brought any further?</p>
          <p eId="para_52">I understand the €9 million remembrance fund is to be established on a statutory basis pending the approval of the Attorney General. Is this matter being dealt with in a manner satisfactory to the Minister for Finance, given the times we are living in? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the fund will be operational by September?</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the Stevens inquiry, which dealt with collusion in the late 1980s? All collusion, not just that in the late 1980s, needs to be investigated and exposed. Will the report of the Stevens inquiry be made available in full to the Government and Opposition parties and will it be made public? To what extent will the report be published?</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I want the Taoiseach to deal with the Stevens report, the publication of which will give us an idea of the extent of the collusion that needs to be investigated. Will the Government look for disclosure in relation to the full period of the Troubles, as there has been a suggestion that collusion was a deep-seated aspect of the entire sorry episode?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_56">The Deputy asked about resources and I can inform him that the money has already been provided in this year's Estimates. That is up and running.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">Yes, it is already in the Estimates. The resources will be available as soon as the period of the Estimates commences. Some €3 million per year is being made available over a three-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">All I am giving in relation to the inquest is the factual position. As most of us recall, the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan took place on the afternoon of Friday, 17 May 1974. The inquest met ten days later, on 27 May 1974, and a report was produced. The evidence presented, which concerned the identities of the victims and medical evidence, enabled the death certificates to be issued. The inquest adjourned and did not meet again until the other day. I can dramatise my view of how things happened, but I am just giving the factual position. If the Garda investigation took place now we would all be in here standing on our heads, but there were different circumstances at the time. The matter was investigated in detail at a certain period in time and then it stopped.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_61">That is what happened. After the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, the relatives of the victims, with whom other Members and I had been in contact over the years, asked the Government to see what could be done in relation to the matter. I asked for clearance from the Government and then we moved. That is what has brought us to this point. There was no active file on the matter, or on hundreds of other cases on this island, between 1976 and 1998. That is the reality. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to go back and deal with all these cases. We can do our best through the Barron and Cory investigations. The cases that were to be included in the Cory investigation were agreed two years ago at Weston Park. If there are public inquiries into some of these issues, in whatever jurisdiction, the Governments have agreed to deal with them. There will be public inquiries into such matters. I fought hard in the previous Government for the establishment of the Saville inquiry and I convinced the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to establish the inquiry, which is ongoing. It is hoped that the inquiry will bring some conclusions to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">In 1997 I saw the difficulties that exist in this regard. President de Klerk, Cyril Ramaphosa and others, who were at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, said that the only way to deal with these matters was by means of a truth and reconciliation commission. I floated this idea at the time but did not receive much support. I received less support when I floated it again. I am quite frank about this issue. We have to deal with it on whatever basis we can. It is best if we allow Mr. Justice Barron, who is examining the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and four or five related cases, and Mr. Justice Cory, who is looking at another half a dozen cases, complete their work before we analyse the issue as a whole. If we believe that we can open up all cases and have public investigations into them all – if one wants to do that, I am sure we can do so – we will not get trust and confidence and we will not be able to move the political agenda forward at the same time. That is my fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">What we have agreed to, we will finish. It is difficult, but we must try to deal with this as best we can. Not a week passes during which I do not meet the relatives of people involved in some terrible atrocity. This is happening more and more. It has been, and will be, extraordinarily difficult to investigate and get to the bottom of all of these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Late last year, the Taoiseach in response to questions on the Barron inquiry, stated that Mr. Justice Barron's report would be available in early 2003. Today he gave us a number of answers as to when he now expects it to be published mentioning "after the summer", "September" and "in the autumn". Given that the Taoiseach earlier indicated different expected closing dates over the period of Mr. Justice Hamilton's and Mr. Justice Barron's work, how confident is he that any of the three responses he gave today will prove to be correct and that we will see publication in any or all of those cases? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the publication of the report is but the first part of a process and that the report must then go before an Oireachtas committee? What is the current position in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Does the Taoiseach support the oft-repeated demand of members of the Justice for the Forgotten group – the families, the bereaved and the injured – for a full public inquiry into the events of 17 May 1974 in this city and in my home town of Monaghan?

          <p eId="para_80">I am not writing the report – it is being written by Mr. Justice Barron. There is a quasi-judicial system in operation. With the agreement of the House some years ago, the Government consulted with the then Chief Justice, the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, as to how to deal with such matters. The Judiciary is totally independent in terms of its work and how judges deal with their investigations – and that is how it should be. My record of predicting the completion of tribunals has not been good in the past five years. However, I hope this will be finished in September and it is certainly my understanding that it will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">In reply to Deputy Joe Higgins, I am trying to look at the context in which people's minds would have been on different investigations. There were many atrocities and a huge number of issues affecting the security of the State in those years. No doubt, those concerned were carrying out investigations without making any progress and were moving on to other issues, many of which all of us will remember. At this remove, I can only assume that must have been the reason – that they felt they were not going to get much data or information and, accordingly, these matters were closed and they moved on to something else. I do not believe there was any malice involved. Apparently, that was how they were operating, strange as it may seem. I believe that is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I have raised all of those issues with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, with successive Secretaries of State and others in the British establishment over several years. We have now reached a certain point and we will just have to wait to see what are the views of Mr. Justice Barron. As he is the person for whom we were trying to obtain information, we will have to await his views on the information he has received, the meetings he has had and the assistance he got from Mr. Blair directly and from the Secretaries of State. I just do not know whether he got everything he needed and what was actually available. We will just have to wait for his report.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_86">It is planned to use electronic voting and vote counting on a countrywide basis at the European and local elections in June 2004. The security assessment report on threats to the external physical features of the voting machine, referred to in the question, was commissioned by my Department in March 2002 before the system was used in three constituencies at the general election of 2002. The issues in that report were considered by the Department and measures were taken, where necessary, to deal with the issues raised. The authors of the security assessment report have recently expressed satisfaction that the actions and measures implemented by my Department in the use of the system meets any concerns expressed in their report.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">Does the Minister of State agree that placing an order costing €35 million for a new system of electronic voting, without discussing the system being proposed with any of the other parties in this House, was a form of dictatorship and arrogance? Can he guarantee to the House that the security codes proposed for this system are under the control of the Government rather than that of a third party? Why did his Department not submit to an Oireachtas committee the details of this system before an order was placed? Will he now agree to make all details regarding the electronic voting system available so that it can be examined and assessed by the other political parties in this House?</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I am concerned that the security code for the system is not available and is under the control only of the company supplying the system. A party that would fiddle around with the electoral system without consulting other parties is going down the slippery slope of dictatorship.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_90">I am sure the Deputy would accept that this is not a question of dictatorship or arrogance. It is important we have a system in place that is foolproof. This matter has not been discussed with my parliamentary party but it has been discussed with the experts and within the Department. When further progress has been made, there will be an opportunity later in the year – I offer that today – possibly in the autumn, for a full briefing with all the parties, the parliamentary parties and officials within them.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Lest the wrong impression is given, this report, which received much publicity some time ago, related to the physical aspect of the machine in the polling station. The machine had already been tested by international testing institutes, one in Holland, the TWO, and the software was tested in Germany by PTB. Zerflow was asked only to examine the security in the polling station, and that was examined. We merely wanted to get an objective view about where the machine should be placed in the station to ensure that it would be in view at all times of the returning officer and the polling clerk, that it would never be out of their view. Instructions were sent to the presiding officer and the polling clerk regarding where it should be placed in his or her view during the poll and that only a voter is allowed to go to the voting machine except in cases when a person is permitted to accompany a voter.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">We have asked for advice on the codes and we are satisfied that the architectural and code review will be done by a private third party of the software for the count and election set up. That is currently in progress. I would be delighted to keep the other parties informed, particularly Deputies Allen and Gilmore and any other Member who wishes to be kept up to date. In the autumn there will be a full briefing. When such a briefing was available prior to the general election not too many were interested in it. That is probably understandable. I am talking about the masses of the Members. Some Members were interested, but this system was installed in only a few constituencies at that time. I understand why not too many would have been interested because the system did not pertain in many constituencies. However, in the last referendum the system was in place in seven constituencies and it worked extremely well. Zerflow indicated only recently at a meeting in the Department that any concerns expressed in its report had been met by action taken or procedures employed in the polling stations.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_95">Local authorities completed or acquired a total of 5,074 housing units in the past year. House starts, including new acquisitions, amounted to 4,349. Details on an individual local authority basis are included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin for 2002. Current indications are that house starts, including acquisitions, will amount to 5,500 units this year and house completions will be in the order of 5,000 units. Both of these output figures include house starts and completions under the Ballymun and inner city regeneration programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The Government has been responding actively to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. Last year total social and affordable housing activity, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies, output from the voluntary sector and under the other social housing measures, met the needs of about 12,700 households compared to just short of 8,700 only three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The total capital funding for housing this year at €1.7 billion is 7% up on the amount provided last year. The substantial increases in the level of funding for social and affordable housing is reflected in the total Exchequer capital provision for this sector in 2003 of €932 million which is more than double the amount spent in 2000. The Government is maintaining and intends to maintain strong social and affordable housing programmes this year and into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">With regard to the reply I received from the Minister of State, this is the third set of figures the Minister of State or his colleague has given me in reply to the same question. We were told in notes we got on estimates that house completions for 2003 would be 4,500. When the Minster appeared before a committee he told us the figure would 4,000 and now because the Minister of State does not want to invite invidious comparison with last year he has upped the figure to 5,000, which includes Ballymun and inner city regeneration programmes. Is it not the case that the position that the housing output for 2003 will be about 20% less than it was for 2002 because the Exchequer allocation for social housing this year is significantly down on what it was last year? Irrespective of which set of figures one takes, with 48,000 applicants on local authority housing lists, is it not the case that it will take 12 years for those on the existing housing list to be housed?</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Has the Minister of State any appreciation of the suffering and frustration being experienced by families who are now waiting, in many cases, for ten or more years for housing on council waiting lists with a decreasing prospect of housing being provided for them? What will he do to increase the provision of social housing given that the cost of housing has become so expensive and renting has become so difficult for many people?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated his intention to undertake a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act 1997. The Act's provisions have now been used at all elections covered by it, including the general election in May 2002. The time is therefore right to review these provisions in light of the experience gained at the various elections. In addition, since its enactment the 1997 Act has been amended a number of times to deal with technical and other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Minister has asked the chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission for a report on the commission's views on the operation of the Act's provisions at the general election. He will also have regard to the contents of the commission's report on election expenditure at the 2002 general election, which was published last week. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for a prohibition on the display or distribution of any notice, sign, poster, card, circular or other document relating to the election, except for official notices from the returning officer, within 50 metres of a polling station. There are no proposals for a further ban on election posters but my Department will listen to any views in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">It is the duty of political parties and others involved in elections and referendums to comply with the litter legislation, which is primarily enforced by local authorities. My Department has reminded local authorities and political parties regularly of the relevant provisions of litter legislation in the context of elections, particularly the requirements in the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to remove posters and poster ties within seven days of polling.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">On behalf of the Green Party, I extend best wishes to the Minister, Deputy Cullen. Go raibh biseach air go luath. Has the Minister of State taken into account that this question is motivated not just by the support of the Green Party for the retention of the ceiling on election spending – it is quite generous and should not be extended any further – but its support for any measures that would reduce waste and littering during an election? Is the Minister of State aware that it has been found in other countries that a difference can be made by providing designated crossroads or town squares with display areas – enough of them that it is clear there is an election going on? Will the Minister examine this? In doing so, will he take into account that the Litter Pollution Act 1997 is not working? Poles are festooned with ties from one election to the next. There is clearly a need to take action to deal with this. Health and safety also needs to be taken into account, given the number of posters that have fallen on people and caused injury, which, luckily, has not been serious.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_123">There are many views on the problem of election posters. Some suggest that there should be a ban, but this would be impossible to police. I accept Deputy Sargent's suggestion about designated areas, but this could lead to other problems – planning permission would be needed, and somebody would have to decide how much time would be required. We could be talking about only a number of days. Each party should act responsibly – a reasonable number of posters should be erected at any time. That is a major responsibility for ourselves as candidates and for the parties. Without giving any definite commitment to the Deputy, I will say that anything is worth considering to try to improve the situation. I will consider any suggestions I receive.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The Deputy is absolutely right about poster ties. The problem is that when the posters are taken down the ties are not removed and it is hard to identify who owns the ties. One possibility is to have ties of a different colour for each party, but that could be difficult as well. On assuming the office with responsibility for the Litter Pollution Act, I instructed officials to write to the various county managers and the local authorities, who have responsibility for implementing the Litter Pollution Act, with a view to ensuring that all the posters and ties be removed. I cannot argue with the Deputy, however; there is a serious problem, and I will look at it very closely with the officials. I only wish I knew the answer, but it is difficult to establish who is responsible for the purpose of an on-the-spot fine. A number of candidates, in both the European and general elections, had to pay on-the-spot fines, but I doubt that anyone was taken to court. It may come to that if we want to impress upon everybody that they have a serious responsibility in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I compliment the Minister of State on his idea of having a different coloured tie for each party. That is one suggestion. Has anybody been fined because of poster ties? I doubt that any party has been fined because of this, although fines may have been issued because of posters. I ask the Minister of State to take account of the failure of the Act in that regard. We need to ensure that the ties are not left up – it increases the cynicism with which people view politics when they see the ties and then hear people talking about litter.</p>

In relation to on-the-spot fines, the litter enforcement statistics from 1997 to 2002 are very general – I do not have any break down indicating which pertain to election posters or ties.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_128">Current land use policy on retailing is set out in retail planning guidelines issued as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. These guidelines came into force on 1 January 2001 and replaced earlier interim retail planning guidelines issued in 1998. The purpose of the retail planning guidelines is to assist local authorities in addressing retail development in the context of their development plans and in assessing applications for planning permission, to guide retailers and developers in formulating development proposals and to ensure that preferred locations for retail development are guided by considerations of sustainable land use, including access by public transport where feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">In relation to the capping of the permitted size of certain retail developments, the guidelines prescribe a maximum area of 3,000 square metres net retail floor space for food store development, except in the greater Dublin area, where the cap is 3,500 square metres. The guidelines also prescribe a maximum area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large scale retail warehouse development. When the retail planning guidelines were published it was indicated they would be reviewed in light of experience with their operation. I am now activating such a review, which will need to consider a number of factors including current and prospective economic circumstances, inflation, land use and sustainable development issues and developments in retailing. It is intended the review will be informed by wide consultation with a view to ensuring that all interested parties have the opportunity of making an input before any decisions are taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Can the Minister give an assurance that any pressure being put on his Department from multinational superstores will be resisted, along with any threats that they will go elsewhere if they do not get their way? I was surprised to hear that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, was taken around one of the major superstores in Scotland by its owners some time ago. The Department must balance the need for competition with the need to ensure that our towns and villages remain viable and retain their retail outlets which are there for people's convenience, especially those who cannot travel the long distances to the superstores on the outskirts of towns and cities. Taking into consideration that post offices are being shut down, banks are closing some of their branches and the ESB is closing some of its shops in rural areas, will he try to ensure that rural Ireland and the villages and towns outside major population areas are not denuded of essential services?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_131">There are pressures from both sides in this regard and it is important to arrive at a balance. It is the intention to ensure that all relevant considerations both from a planning and economic point of view are taken into account. It was clearly stated when the new guidelines came into operation a few years ago that they would be reviewed within three or four years, which has happened. There are different reasons for this. A couple of reports were drawn up by State organisations. A Forfás consumer pricing report stated that Irish foodstuffs and non-food consumer prices are among the highest in the euro zone. There was also the national competitive council statement on inflation. Some State reports urge us to look at these matters but it is a case of achieving a balance and trying to look at the issue from an economic and sustainable land use point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">When in Scotland on other business some months ago, the Minister took the opportunity to look at an operation of a well known multi-national organisation which had indicated some interest in setting up business in Ireland. He looked at this operation to see at first hand what it was about. It is a case of reviewing the issue and letting everyone have their say. There are competing pressures and it is important to look at the issue from a wide perspective.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_133">The Minister of State must accept that even though inflation was running at 5% for a while, RGDATA pointed out that food prices were increasing at a rate of approximately 2.5%. Therefore, we cannot blame lack of competition for these increases. His Department should not fall into the trap of thinking that the introduction of super stores will mean a reduction in prices, or that as a result of wiping out smaller retailers and corner shops prices will not shoot through the roof. This is what has happened in other countries, including the UK. Will he ensure that a balance will be struck between competition, proper planning and sustainable development, particularly outside the bigger population centres?</p>

          <p eId="para_134">That is the intention. As I said earlier, there is a current cap of 3,500 square feet in the Dublin area and 6,000 for other stores. However, some stores which were already erected exceed 6,000 square feet. There are probably stores which double the 6,000 square feet. Everyone is entitled to have their say. I agree with the Deputy that it is about considering the issue from every perspective. What is suitable for Dublin might not be suitable in the country. All parties will be given time to have an input.</p>

      if his attention has been drawn to a report prepared by two leading computer scientists based in NUI Maynooth suggesting that the electronic voting system is potentially open to abuse and threatens the integrity of democracy; if he intends to extend electronic voting to all areas for the European and local elections in 2004; the estimated cost of this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [16661/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_69">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_136">Some 1.5 pages of the 11 page report to which the Deputy referred deal with the electronic voting and vote counting system being adopted here. My Department does not accept the conclusions drawn in the report, for detailed reasons which I will spell out.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">It is the Government's intention that the electronic voting and vote counting system will be used in all local and European elections in June 2004 and detailed planning for this is being co-ordinated by my Department. Electronic voting is a desirable modernisation of our electoral procedures and public reaction to the use of voting machines in the pilot constituencies has been extremely positive. I am confident the new system will enhance rather than weaken the integrity and efficiency of the Irish electoral process. The cost of the system is approximately €36 million, plus VAT. As the system has an estimated life of 20 years, most of the cost will be recouped in greater efficiency and reduced staff costs over the life of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">My Department's reasons for rejecting the conclusions of the NUI Maynooth report are as follows. First, the report restates four points from a security assessment report which was commissioned by my Department in March 2002 on possible threats to the external physical features of the voting machine and before the system was used at the general election in May 2002. These points were considered by my Department before the use of the system and procedures were put in place to deal, where necessary, with the matters concerned. As indicated in reply to Priority Question No. 75 the authors of the original security assessment report have now indicated that they are satisfied that the action taken and procedures implemented in the use of the system meet any concerns expressed in their report.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"><i>Additional Information</i>Second, the report questions a survey carried out by MRBI, on the basis that the questionnaire and report is not available. In fact the survey report was and is available, free of charge, from my Department. Third, the report comments adversely on the size and brightness of the preference number display. The preference number on the voting machine display has been increased in size and brightness, having regard to voters' comments in the pilot uses of the machine. Fourth, the authors of the report refer to the need for a voter to be able to amend his or her preferences. The factual position is that the voting machine allows a voter to change his or her preferences in private and in secret before pressing the cast vote button. The details of a preference recorded will also be displayed on the voting machine screen so that it can be viewed by the voter before the cast vote button is pressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Fifth, the report lays emphasis on a procedure promoted by an American writer on the need for a system to produce a paper ballot which would be retained in the voting machine and which could be used in a manual count later. This idea, while it may be suitable in other countries, would not be suitable here as it could endanger the secrecy of the ballot and moreover it would not be useful for a recheck on the electronic count result, due to the requirement to mix the votes before the count commences. However, our system will print a ballot paper for each vote if required by a court order in an election petition hearing. The printed ballot paper in such a case would have the details of the movement of the vote at different counts. Sixth, the report refers to the non-availability of the source code for the system especially the count source code. Making available of the source code raises important commercial and security issues and it is a matter under consideration in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">This report does not raise any new issues concerning the security of the electronic system to be used and its conclusions cannot be considered to have been substantiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">At the time the author received material from the Department. We did not hear from the author afterwards. The report went on the Internet by the tutor and my officials and I will be happy to meet at any time with this person if we can assist in any way.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">I note from the Minister of State's reply that the cost of rolling out electronic voting for the next European and local elections in June next year is €36 million, plus VAT, which brings the cost to almost €45 million. What will he say to the parents of children with disabilities for whom funding has been cut this year, to someone who is waiting for a disabled person's grant in a local authority area where this is no longer being made available, to someone who is waiting ten years for local authority housing which they cannot get because of the cuts or to the parent of a child in a school which has not been provided with funding this year? How can he say to these people that there is no funding for these services, yet the Government is prepared to spend €45 million on a system of electronic voting which has been established as being unsafe, insecure, with no traceability, no transparency and which frankly is unnecessary? Is this not a scandalous waste of money? Will he simply cop on and cancel the rolling out of electronic voting for next year, given that spending €45 million is a scandalous waste of money on something which is unsafe, insecure and will make our electoral system less transparent and less open to public accountability.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">The cost was correctly quoted at €36 million, plus VAT. As the company will be incorporated in this country the VAT will go into the Exchequer. Therefore, it is a net gain to taxpayers of €38 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I appreciate Deputy Gilmore's concerns about people awaiting DPGs, those on disability payments and people on the housing waiting list. However, we must move on. This is a modern system.</p>

I again put it to the Minister of State that the €45 million which will be spent on this unnecessary electronic voting system should be made available to local authorities that are currently refusing disabled person's grants for essential extensions, including bathroom and shower facilities, for people who in many cases are in pain. These people have been refused services by local authorities that are funded by his Department.

To help eliminate quality problems in rural areas, it is intended to introduce a licensing system to regulate the operations of the group water sector. Licensing will not alone help to ensure that prescribed drinking water quality standards are enforced, but will bring a new level of professionalism to the sector, and help individual group schemes to assure themselves as to the quality of their service. Drafting of the Bill is nearing completion, and it is hoped to be published over the summer.</p>

The Deputy will be aware of the substantial funding to ensure that we upgrade the quality of water in all the group schemes, which have served us well over many years. We now must move on and ensure that all water through the tap for domestic purposes is of the highest possible quality.

          <p eId="para_162">Overall Government policy on rural housing has been set out in the national spatial strategy, which recognises the need for sustainable rural settlement to underpin the vibrancy of rural areas. Having regard to this requirement, the strategy sets out a rural housing framework which has four objectives: to sustain and renew established rural communities in a way that responds to the various spatial, structural and economic changes taking place, while protecting the important assets rural areas possess; to strengthen the established structure of villages and smaller settlements both to support local economies and to accommodate additional population in a way that supports the viability of public transport and local infrastructure and services such as schools and water services; to ensure that key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and economic vitality; and to ensure that rural settlement policies take account of and are appropriate to the differing local circumstances in different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">In seeking to meet these objectives, the national spatial strategy draws a distinction between rural generated housing, that is, housing needed within the established rural community by persons working in rural areas or in nearby urban areas, and urban generated housing, that is, housing in rural locations sought by people living and working in urban areas, including second homes. The strategy states that, subject to good planning practice on issues such as site location and design, rural generated housing needs should be met where they arise. In relation to urban generated housing the strategy states that development driven by cities and towns should generally take place within the built up areas or by way of carefully planned extension to the built up area. However, for those seeking a rural lifestyle while working in a larger city or town, the strategy points out that smaller towns and villages can cater for this type of housing demand in a sustainable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"><i>Additional information.</i>The strategy indicates that these broad policies need to be further developed to respond to the different circumstances in different rural areas, for example rural areas close to larger urban areas, rural areas with a strong agricultural base, structurally weak rural areas which have suffered population loss and economic decline and certain areas where distinctive, traditional settlement patterns have evolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The broad principles for rural settlement policy set out in the national spatial strategy will have to be developed in more detail through regional planning guidelines and local development plans acknowledging and responding to the different circumstances in different parts of the country. I intend that my Department will, in the autumn, issue for public consultation draft guidelines on rural housing location in the interests of promoting best practice on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">Does the Minister accept there has been major rural depopulation over the past 40 years? Does he accept that planning policy in those years, including the National Spatial Strategy, has accelerated that processes of rural depopulation? Does he accept that for those of us who are interested in the future of rural Ireland there is a need for a clear strategy that involves those who want to live permanently in rural Ireland being able to do so? Second homes and holiday homes represent a separate issue. Those who want to live and work in rural Ireland should be entitled to do so and not be forced to go into existing settlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Would the Minister accept that those who are from rural Ireland have first priority to go back and live in their own areas? Would the Minister accept that those who want to retire to rural Ireland should be entitled to do so? Is the Minister aware of the ridiculous case of the Secretary General from his Department who wanted a retirement home on Sherkin Island where he has been a regular holidaymaker for years? He got planning permission from the county council, but An Taisce objected and he has been fired out by An Bord Pleanála? Does he accept that kind of example shows how ridiculous present Government policy is? If we are to do anything for rural Ireland we must have a positive regeneration policy, which encourages people to live permanently in rural Ireland.</p>

In terms of the rural development and housing, referred to by the Deputy, those who have ties with the countryside should be respected and we must find a balance.

      <b>Mr. Murphy</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government</b>
      if he is considering the imposition of a tax on heavy duty plastic sacks similar to the retail plastic bag tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [16629/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_176">An environmental levy on plastic bags was introduced on 4 March 2002 with the primary purpose of influencing consumer behaviour so as to minimise the use of plastic bags dispensed at retail outlets and lessen their impact on the environment as a highly visible component of litter. The levy has been an overwhelming success with a reduction in the use of plastic bags by over 90% and a corresponding impact on the visible environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">However, the environmental levy on plastic shopping bags does not apply to plastic primary packaging, in the form of bags or otherwise, containing goods or products, regardless of size or contents, nor does it apply to plastic sacks sold as products in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Heavy duty plastic sacks are sold for a variety of consumer uses, for example, as bin liners. I do not consider that the same anti-litter rationale as applied in the case of plastic shopping bags necessarily arises in the case of those types of products which have a valid use in the consumer's management of domestic waste. I am not therefore considering proposals to apply levies to such products.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I am aware of the increasing replacement of paper packaging with plastic in the agricultural sector, particularly in the areas of animal feed and vegetable packaging. It should be noted that under Article 18 of EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, member states are prohibited from impeding the placing on the market of packaging that satisfies the provisions of the directive. This is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in Annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, necessary measures are required to ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and or collection of used packaging, and for the reuse or recovery, including recycling, of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting the packaging waste recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in Directive 94/62/EC. Producer responsibility initiatives already operate in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste such as Repak Limited in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Films Producers Group, with administrative support from Repak in the case of farm plastics such as silage bale wrap and sheeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"><i>Additional information</i>In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">My Department will keep under review the use of plastic packaging in the agricultural and other sectors and will consider whether further arrangements are required to improve its collection and recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I believe they are doing an excellent job and we should look at further using their services.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_184">I agree that the tax on retail plastic bags was a success and we have eliminated them as a source of pollution. However, is the Minister of State resting on his laurels? I saw recently that there is a proposal to impose an environmental tax on chewing gum. Is there a proposal from the Department to introduce such a tax?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_185">The Deputy will find, in the context of An Agreed Programme for Government, the Department has considered further levies on problematic packaging whether it is beverage containers or, indeed, chewing gum. I wish we could find the solution to the chewing gum problem. However, we are not resting on our laurels. We are working closely with the Irish Farm Film Producers Group through informal talks. There is a charge on producers and they, as a result, have to collect all the heavy plastics such as bale wrap. This is collected by the farm relief services. Perhaps after some informal discussions, we can prevail upon them to also collect the other plastic bags that are used for packaging feeds. We cannot tax those because of trade regulations but we can consider an economic strategy. However, there is no intention of new taxes at the moment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_186">The plastic bag levy is welcomed by people as an anti-littering measure and an attempt to reduce waste. I ask the Minister of State to look again at the position in regard to the larger plastic bag. In my constituency in north County Dublin, the plastic bag is taking over from the paper sack as a form of packaging of goods in farming. It is a retrograde step as this form of packaging does not biodegrade. Will the Minister of State also look at returnable packaging measures for products such as aluminium cans and glass, as we had in the past? These measures are being introduced in other countries such as Denmark and Germany. I ask that such measures be fast-tracked so that we may have genuine incentives to reduce waste?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_187">I refer to the European Union directive under which I cannot place a ban on trade by a tax on these products. However, I will consider the situation and we will have further informal talks with the IFFP. It is changing over to an Irish board which involves a transition period. After that, we will enter into further talks to establish the same procedure with plastic bags on farms as currently exists with heavy wrap.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Deputy's suggestion on options for deposit return systems will also be given consideration. The success of the plastic bag levy has shown clearly that we should do something further to overcome the serious problems that exist.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_238">I remind the Taoiseach that public order on our streets is one of the critical issues on people's minds. The Government reneged on a solemn commitment and promise made to the people that 2,000 extra gardaí would be recruited. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently stated on a television programme that his Department had no moneys to deal with this promise. Public order offences have tripled to 117 per day during the Government's term in office. We have also learned that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will spend €15 million on refurbishing his offices and those of the Department at a time when school buildings are falling in on children's heads and when many other priorities should be dealt with around the country. The latest work of fiction, the progress report on the implementation of the programme for Government, states that the 2,000 extra gardaí will only come on stream as economic circumstances permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government gives greater priority to refurbishing the offices of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform than to the reallocation of €15 million, which would pay the salaries of 725 new gardaí? How in conscience, when 117 public order offences are being committed daily on the streets of our country, can the Taoiseach and the Government decide to give greater priority to the refurbishment of ministerial offices than to the recruitment of much needed gardaí to protect our citizens and to maintain law and order on our streets?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_142">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_240">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has outlined to the House a number of times recently what his plans are on recruitment of gardaí. He wants to try to increase the number of gardaí by 2,000 during the lifetime of the Government and, in the meantime, to maximise the resources in Templemore to ensure he maintains Garda strength at 12,200. He is committed to doing so and he has money in the Estimates to do so. That figure was agreed with him in the Book of Estimates for this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Deputy Kenny will be well aware of the actions of the Minister in relation to violent crime. There has been public order legislation and tough measures have been implemented to deal with public order issues. The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 is being rushed through the House to deal with a number of important issues that have arisen through the analysis of public order issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Gangland killing is also a serious issue and there were two more killings over the weekend. While these are operational matters for the Garda, the Minister has divided the force into specialised groups to try to deal with these issues. Far from ignoring crime, the Minister of justice, given the substantial resources, staff and increased commitments he has, is endeavouring to deal with it. It is entirely disingenuous of Deputy Kenny to say this issue is in any way being ignored given the legislative base the Minister has, the improvements in and strengthening of the law, the number of gardaí available to him and the fact that Templemore is operating at its maximum.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_243">The Taoiseach's answer is quite confusing. He speaks about the Minister maximising resources, although the Minister recently said publicly on television that he had no more money to recruit gardaí. The Taoiseach referred to him as the Minister of justice; I thought he was supposed to be the Minister for justice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_245">This money comes from the public purse and priority has been given through the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to allocate €15 million for refurbishment of ministerial offices over and above the priority accorded to the recruitment of gardaí to keep law and order on our streets, given the legal base the Minister has. If Templemore is not capable of producing more recruits, surely other facilities can be used for temporary training of new gardaí. The Taoiseach has a moral responsibility to see to it that the priorities of the taxpayer, who funds the public purse, are addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">In his time, serious crime has increased by 22% and assaults have increased by 50%. There were 1,886 more assaults in 2002 than in 2001, with 16 assaults and nine sexual assaults every day. The detection rate has fallen from 41% to 38%. I ask the Taoiseach to maximise resources and give the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the necessary priority to keep law and order on the streets. Will he and the Government decide to reallocate the €15 million and, instead of refurbishing ministerial offices, use it for the recruitment and training of gardaí?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_146">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_247">I was not one bit confusing in what I said. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is working off a figure of 12,200. That is the current authorised strength of the Garda. He is resourced for that and the priority is to bridge the gap and make maximum use this year of the existing capacity of the Garda training college and to bring the strength of the force to its highest ever level. That is what is happening. As I understand it, Templemore cannot take more students for training. We are committed to increasing the number as resources permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">With regard to crime figures, the last quarterly figures showed that there was a drop of 10% but that is neither here nor there. As long as there is crime, we should try to deal with the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I want to bring the Taoiseach back to the deal that he caused to be done on the day before the Government came into office, when he asked his friend and now backbencher, Deputy Woods, to do a deal with the religious congregations about their contribution to compensation for victims of abuse in residential institutions. The Taoiseach will recall that was done on 5 June 2002 and he will recall, for ease of reference, that the arrangement provided for unlimited exposure of the taxpayer and the Exchequer and a ring-fenced contribution from the religious institutions. It was roughly on the basis of one third cash, one third properties already transferred and one third properties to be identified for transfer. Under the deed of indemnity the properties were to be identified within nine months and accepted by the State. Now that the nine months have passed, have those properties been bestowed on the State? Is the Taoiseach satisfied, bad deal as it was, that at least that contribution has been made by the religious congregations?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_255">Subject to getting the precise details, as I understand it, the lands and properties have been identified. I do not think they have been passed to the State but there is a number of these in the education area. Some time ago the Minister for Education and Science informed me of some of the properties the Department hoped to get and others that were still under negotiation. I can provide a list of the updated position. Deputy Rabbitte does not share my view. Perhaps the negotiations finished last June but they had gone on for a considerable time and they were properly conducted. Since we last spoke about the issue, the data were put in the public domain. I still believe it was a fair and responsible deal, which went through all the Cabinet procedures. With regard to the sites, I have every confidence the religious authorities will honour the commitments they gave. The Minister for Education and Science was anxious to get particular sites and lands that were more important to him than others. There might still be some level of discussion taking place on that issue but there is a commitment that they will be handed over to the State.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_256">By way of reply to a parliamentary question on 10 June, the Minister for Education and Science made it plain that not one single property has been transferred in the nine months.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>

          <p eId="para_259">We are agreed on that. On the identity question, the Minister stated: "However, a number of other properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title."</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It would appear that the majority of the properties identified to be transferred have been rejected as being of no benefit to the State. In respect of the €40 million to accrue from the properties already transferred, according to the Minister's reply: "To date none of the properties on the list has been accepted." Regarding the €40 million that was to accrue from the properties already transferred, none of the properties is deemed suitable by the redress unit in the Department of Education and Science. Not only did the Taoiseach get a bad deal initially but it seems the deal, such as it is, has not been enforced and that taxpayers have good reason to feel acutely aggrieved at him and the former Minister, Deputy Woods. A person who would do a deal like that could not be sent to the well for water.</p>

The amount of money involved was stipulated and the Minister for Education and Science has indicated the lands he requires. The fact that he has not agreed to accept those offered to date is an indication that there are others which he prioritises and wants to get. He has a register, if not a complete one, of church lands in which he is interested. I understand he has identified sites which he and his Department want. The State's position is that these sites must be delivered.</p>

Obviously, there are cases where he might otherwise have to purchase sites for school programmes. Hundreds of schools require land for extensions and most of the land, particularly in primary education, is in the hands of religious bodies. The Minister has many sites.

          <p eId="para_270">I understand the Taoiseach may be heading off to Thessalonika this week to deal with the new EU constitution. I am interested in the Government's position regarding the EURATOM Treaty. Is the Taoiseach aware that a large number of MEPs and parliamentarians have come together in a united call that the EURATOM Treaty should not be a part of the new constitution, even as an annexe? Given the interest shown by the Government in the Sellafield case, it is surprising that it has not signed up to this common approach. Is the Government considering signing up or is it pursuing another agenda?</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Is the Taoiseach aware that Article 1 of the EURATOM Treaty calls for "the speedy establishment and growth of nuclear industries"? This is not what we expect from the Government, given its opposition to Sellafield. Is the Taoiseach conscious of the fact that most of the EU member states have no nuclear power or are phasing it out and that since the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents there has been a radical change in the attitude to EURATOM and nuclear power in the EU? I ask the Taoiseach to provide leadership in supporting the call by the Governments of Austria and Luxembourg, among others, to include a sunset clause that would see the EURATOM Treaty phased out after 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Will the Taoiseach support the integration of nuclear safety, which we all support, in the environmental and health aspects of the new EU constitution? That will be the place to deal with the clean-up operations following this sorry episode of EU history, when nuclear power has dominated research funding to the exclusion of other energy forms such as renewable energy.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I commend the work which was completed on Friday in the convention. It certainly provides the basis for a successful summit in Thessalonika and for the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference in mid-October. I acknowledge the work everyone has put into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The EURATOM Treaty was discussed last February. At that stage, Deputy John Bruton put forward a paper from the praesidium to which the Irish Government responded. Within the group of countries – the friends of the communitaire group – we have supported initiatives of Germany and other countries and the winding down and closure of nuclear stations has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">It has not yet been decided how the EURATOM Treaty is to be finalised. I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, just after Question Time today. Precisely how it is to be dealt with, whether it is to be an annexe to the treaty or take up a separate section, has not yet been resolved. When we put forward a position paper last February, agreement had not been achieved. Deputy Bruton endeavoured to get agreement at the praesidium as to how it would be dealt with but that was not finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">If the group that we have been supporting on all the other issues – and our Austrian friends who have been taking a lead are in that – we will certainly be supportive of it.</p>

Why did the Government not sign the agreed call from MEPs and parliamentarians, and the Governments of Austria and Luxembourg, to bring an end to the EURATOM Treaty and to insert a sunset clause which would come into effect after 2007? I understand that Deputy Carey signed it but that the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, did not. Can we have a clear response as to where the Government stands on this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Giscard d'Estaing can be forgiven for supporting the EURATOM Treaty, given the French association with nuclear power and that country's disproportionate spending of €3 billion on nuclear power. Where is the Irish interest? Is this about not upsetting the British over Sellafield or nuclear power in general? Will the Government give clear support for the ending of the EURATOM Treaty? It is a dinosaur among EU institutions and has outlived its usefulness and relevance. I ask the Taoiseach to be proactive in this regard.</p>

At the meeting of environment Ministers in Luxembourg last week on environmental liabilities, we supported the principle of the directive and voted against the nuclear section included therein. We have taken that view throughout the convention on any areas where there was reference to the involvement of the nuclear industry. This is consistent with what we are doing in OSPAR, UNCLOS and in the case in The Hague.

This is causing grave difficulties and even closure for small businesses and is now one of the most serious threats to employment.

It should recognise that there are other parties in this House that would also appreciate a briefing. I hope that can be resolved. It is hardly too much trouble for a Government that does not like to take too much trouble about anything.</p>

Section 3(3)(<i>b</i>) states that such a person would have powers, duties, rights and obligations as a member of the Garda Síochána.

          <p eId="para_536">It is important that this point is raised. It is a matter for the Minister to clarify whether the amendment will add to the Bill or otherwise. It is appropriate that my colleague has sought to ensure that this Bill is worded to optimum effect. This is a historic and important Bill. It is an indication of the maturing of Irish society. It is also an indication by the Oireachtas that there is wholehearted acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent agreements since then. From that point of view, we need to get the wording of the Bill exactly right. That is not in any way to suggest that the central point of the Bill is not something which I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically endorse.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I was glad to have the opportunity yesterday to see members of the PSNI in the police college in Northern Ireland. I went there with other members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. It was heart-warming to observe the spirit and morale in that college. It has problems in terms of accommodation and on the infrastructure side in that the building needs to be replaced. That was not the issue. The issue is that young men and women are studying there to become members of the PSNI. Its membership is a mixture of gender and, under the 50:50 rule, of people from the different communities drawn from an enormous recruitment pool, which we all must enthusiastically endorse and support. A further development of the PSNI is the implementation of the recommendations arising from Patton and elsewhere for the exchange of members between the two forces, which we all must also enthusiastically endorse, and I certainly do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">On the amendment, I am open to argument as to whether the phraseology suggested by the Deputy is an improvement of the Bill or otherwise. It is up to the Minister to convince us one way or the other. This amendment does not take from the central tenor of the approach, which should be the enthusiastic support and endorsement by all Members for the development that is taking place under this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I am opposed to this amendment because it is clear from the provisions of section 3 (1)(<i>a</i>) that a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland who is seconded to the Garda Síochána and appointed under this section is appointed to a rank in the Garda Síochána. The relevant words are “appoint a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to a rank in the Garda Síochána”.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">A person appointed under this section will be formally appointed to the Garda Síochána. He or she will be under the direction and control of the Garda Commissioner, as is provided for in section 3(3)(<i>a</i>). In addition, section 3(3)(<i>b</i>) provides that he or she will have the powers, duties, rights and obligations of a member of the Garda Síochána of the rank to which he or she was appointed. He or she will be subject to the Garda disciplinary committee system.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">It should be pointed out that the following provisions under subsection (4) do not apply to a person who is a member of the Garda Síochána: Sections 10 and 11 of the 1924 Act, various portions of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925 and regulations thereunder, with the exceptions specified, and the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">It is envisaged that somebody who is a member of the PSNI will be eligible for appointment to a rank in the Garda Síochána and once such an appointment takes place, he or she will have the powers, duties and rights of a member of the Garda. The formulation for which the Deputy is arguing is not really necessary and would interfere with the present wording of section 3, so I would prefer to leave it as it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">The Minister stated in his last reply that certain parts of this legislation, such as the compensation scheme, apply to the Garda Síochána but not to PSNI members. The reason for this amendment is that if a scheme were negotiated by the Garda in the future, the Minister would have the flexibility to apply new regulations where necessary. This would come in useful for disciplinary matters in particular. The current wording does not allow the Minister the flexibility to apply any new regulations.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_555">In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_556">"5.–(1) All appointments under <i>section 2</i> and secondments under <i>sections 3</i> and <i>4 </i>shall be subject to human rights qualifications and screening for misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">(2) No officer shall be deemed eligible for an appointment under <i>section 2</i> or a secondment under <i>sections 3</i> or <i>4</i> unless that officer has completed approved human rights training within their own force.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">(3) Notwithstanding a determination of eligibility under <i>subsection (2),</i> no officer shall be deemed eligible for an appointment under <i>section 2</i> or a secondment under <i>sections 3</i> or <i>4</i> if she or he is the subject of an investigation or inquiry, whether internal or otherwise”.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">This amendment is to deal with a gap we noticed when we first started to discuss this Bill. It is a pity that the Bill is being rushed because we should be able to address this matter more fully. The initial amendments we tabled would have been appropriate even at this stage. We are dealing here with human rights and are not asking for anything which would not normally be expected or which is contrary to the desire for good policing. It applies not only to the PSNI but also to the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I welcomed the Minister's answer to a question in my name a few months ago on human rights training in the Garda Síochána. He stated that the training would not only be given to new recruits but that it was intended to extend training to existing members. The problem is that the same is not happening, nor is it, to my knowledge, due to happen, in the PSNI. Any student of recent Irish history or politics will be aware of the many complaints against the RUC and its latest configuration, the PSNI. There have been many violations of human rights in recent times, but those who have been guilty of human rights abuses, which are catalogued and have been investigated three times by Sir John Stevens, still have the right to remain within the PSNI. If this Bill is passed, there is nothing to prevent these people becoming gardaí for the period of their secondment.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I am not the only person who believes this matter should be dealt with. Anybody who took note of the most recent Stevens report, which comprised only 19 pages of a huge document, will know that Sir John Stevens himself comes to the conclusion that there was collusion, a wilful failure to keep records and an absence of accountability, and that members of the police force withheld intelligence and evidence and ran agents who were involved in murder and mayhem. No member of the RUC, and the RUC Special Branch in particular, has ever been charged, for example, with any offence regarding the attacks on 80 people initiated by an RUC agent, Brian Nelson, which led to 29 deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">If this Bill is enacted, those members of the police force who are guilty of orchestrating killings and other instances of collusion within the Six Counties could end up serving in this jurisdiction. This is not acceptable to me or to the ordinary citizens of this State. That is why I have tabled an amendment seeking that, at the very minimum, human rights investigations and screening for misconduct are carried out in relation to PSNI officers or constables who are to serve here and also in regard to members of the Garda who are to serve in the Six Counties. It is not just members of the PSNI who have been guilty of human rights abuses; members of the Garda are and have been under investigation for very similar activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The Stevens report was not the only one to outline the failings of the police system. One of my earlier amendments provided that the coming into force of the Bill would be contingent on a ruling from the oversight commissioner on the Patten recommendations, but this amendment was ruled out of order. The latest report of the oversight commissioner states that human rights training for members of the PSNI is one of the crucial areas of the Patten recommendations. He identified this as an area of concern where changes are "well within the control of one or more of the policing institutions, but which have yet to show sufficient progress."  In previous reports the oversight commissioner stated that human rights training for serving officers and civilian employees has seen limited progress and there is a need for a clear implementation programme which would include financial implications and time schedules. If the amendment is accepted it might force the PSNI to fast-forward the implementation plan and training might take place. This might force out officers who have been guilty of colluding with loyalist death squads.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The Patten report recommended that a new oath should be taken by all police officers expressing an explicit commitment to upholding human rights. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 obliges the chief constable to bring the new oath to the attention of serving officers and to ensure they understand it, and understand the need to carry out their duty in accordance with it. However, the oversight commissioner reports that progress in relation to serving officers – former RUC officers – is lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">This Bill is an act of completion under the Good Friday Agreement. However, the other aspects to which I referred are also acts of completion. At the very minimum we should expect human rights equalisation. It is a pity we have not had sight of the Garda inspectorate Bill which would indicate whether the gardaí would come under scrutiny such as is undertaken by the police ombudsman in the Six Counties or the oversight commissioner in relation to the PSNI.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_408">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_566">I support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment. Given the new beginning in policing, it is necessary for members of the police to have human rights qualifications. This is more important given that many members of the PNSI – former members of the RUC – have been guilty of collusion with Unionist death squads in murdering Nationalists, Catholics, human rights lawyers and a Sinn Féin councillor. In order to ensure a new beginning, it is very important that police officers are trained in human rights in relation to screening and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The Stevens inquiry report was outlined by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. We have seen just 19 pages of the 1,000 page document. At the time we stated that the Government should have full access to the contents of the report. The report makes known to the public what was going on for a considerable time, and condoned by the State. If there is to be a new beginning, which I and every member of Sinn Féin wish to see, we need a policing service which will have such training and will have no problem signing up to the human rights code. Officers should complete human rights training within their own force, which is a positive thing. It should not apply to just the policing service here but globally. It is something towards which we should all strive. Since we are trying to bring about a new beginning, the amendment strengthens the Bill. I will await what the Minister has to say in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Some officers who are deemed eligible may be subject to an investigation or inquiry, internal or otherwise. This aspect must be factored into the legislation, which is what the amendment proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I ask that the issue be taken on board and that the amendments be agreed to. It would be a statement of trust for our communities, particularly the Nationalist community in the Six Counties who have had to live the nightmare of having a corrupt, partisan and sectarian police force. Anyone who is prepared to undertake human rights training, and sign up to this code, will benefit from it. It could have the desired effect within communities where the policing service operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">We have seen on our television screens in this State some terrible abuses by gardaí. This also highlights the need for this type of training and for people to be compelled to observe a human rights code. I ask that the amendments be supported.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_571">I support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment. In doing so I say that we need an all-Ireland police service. The amendment, if accepted, would offer some kind of interim measure in terms of a cross-Border police service. Is this it, without even some level of rudimentary screening? As it is clear at this point that we are not getting Patten, what are we getting? Will the legislation afford any level of protection to communities, North and South? If so, this is the opportunity to do this. We need to have watchdogs in place. The amendment offers us a very practical and common sense watchdog which should not be offensive or an insult to anyone. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider it carefully. People argue that we are starting from scratch with this process. If we are starting from scratch, now is the time to include the screening process and watchdogs and to try to get the process right.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">When considering the RUC, one is often told one will get a few bad apples in any barrel. Unfortunately, my view, which is shared by many people throughout the island, particularly in the north east of the country, is that it is not just a case of a few bad apples, it is more a case of a foul orchard. To impose that level of mistrust, so to speak, on the people of this State, or <i>vice versa,</i> would be a major mistake on the part of the Government. This is a common sense, practical amendment which should be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I will not deal with the Stevens report as it has already been mentioned. Suffice to say that if evidence were needed, surely it is evidence enough that a British policeman could not publish his report, except for a very small synopsis of the least offensive part of the entire report. I wonder what the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform thinks of that report, particularly the fact that officers under investigation in the report will be spread out not just across the Six Counties but the entire island. Is that a practical, common sense road to go down? I suggest it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">In regard to the gardaí, we all know they have neither wings, harps nor halos. The people of Fermanagh and Tyrone will not welcome sharp-shooters from places like Abbeylara policing their community. In this amendment we are not just looking at the issue one way. It deals with the Garda as well as the RUC. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, I accept the prospect of the commencement of human rights training for gardaí. It is unfortunate that is not in place yet. However, at least this amendment would ensure that would be the case. Even if the RUC was not ready to comply with it before its members are seconded here, accepting this amendment would ensure that the gardaí who may choose to go and serve in the North, could at least be able to imbue their new found colleagues with some semblance of human rights training.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">No one needs a police service more than the Nationalist, republican and Unionist working class communities in the North. We are not aiming to slow that process but to speed it up. To deliver on such a proper policing service requires, at a minimum, this amendment to the Bill. I believe that the Minister knows that all of us on the Sinn Féin benches would be very happy to not only support this Bill, but also to sponsor it at a future date when the time is right and when proper legislation has been enacted to deliver what would be a real police service. Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, that opportunity is not available to us at this time. Acceptance of this amendment would be a good indication that at least we could trust the Minister on some issues, if not in going to the shop for milk at least when dealing with the RUC. I ask Members to support this very reasonable, logical and common sense amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_410">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_576">It is important for us to lay down the guidelines for the future and for the new Ireland now. We are talking about a framework for the future. I will be the first to accept that very nasty things happened in the past 30 years, particularly in Northern Ireland, but also in other parts of the island. I will not have a post mortem on that or on those responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Yesterday morning, I met the members of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. That body exists to hold the new PSNI responsible through the Chief Constable. Already its performance has clearly been impressive. It is a question of whether, not just as part of an act of completion or in the implementation of our responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement, we are prepared to trust and have confidence in the future. Any question of a narrow or carping approach in relation to the PSNI sends all the wrong signals. From my discussions with the members of the board and from everything I saw in the police college in Belfast I was convinced that enormous progress has been made. The policing board is doing a great job. That was also clear from my discussions with Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, whom I met on Sunday night.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">We are into a new era and our approach should be to be part of that and support it fully. From that point of view, it is incumbent on all of us who have a genuine interest in the new Ireland and the future development of this island to put our support behind the PSNI. That involves accepting that it be in this Bill on an equal status with the Garda Síochána. If we want to talk about separate developments in the Garda Síochána, such as an ombudsman, we will do so another time. We cannot suggest in a snide way that because of problems in the past we must put restrictions on the future of the PSNI. We should go out and support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">We should not support it in the football match tonight in Kilmacud, but should support the Oireachtas in that game. We should be there wholeheartedly welcoming them to Dublin as part of Irish society as they come to play a civilised game in the capital city of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We are talking about the spirit, which should move us all in relation to the future of Northern Ireland, and part of that spirit is acceptance of the PSNI and the policing board, that we are in a new era and that we should fully support and endorse what is happening in that new era.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_411" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I do not propose to accept this amendment. I understand that the regulations made under section 7(2) can specify any experience or qualification that may be necessary or desirable for appointment to any ranks. If human rights were not the subject of adequate training in any police force at any time in the future, that could be prescribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I believe all PSNI officers have received training in the application of the Human Rights Act 1998. More recently all PSNI officers have been trained in the code of ethics, which has been drafted to reflect the European Convention on Human Rights, the relevant United Nations standards and best practice in ethical policing in the United Kingdom and other countries. All Police Service of Northern Ireland officers are required by law to carry out their duties in accordance with the code of ethics published by the Policing Board of Northern Ireland. Training in human rights is fully integrated in all police recruit training.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The same applies to this State now. Human rights training forms part of the Garda Síochána basic education. The Garda College currently provides a number of training courses for members in the area of human rights. For example, human rights and diversity training is provided for trainee gardaí and a two-day development course on human rights, anti-racism and ethics is provided for inspectors and sergeants. That course is designed to provide a basic introduction to international human rights standards. To further support and enhance human rights training, a generic human rights training course for Garda teachers and trainers has been developed and is being delivered between March and September this year to 132 teachers and trainers. The aim of that course is to facilitate the integration of human rights concerns, norms, principles and ethics into all relevant aspects of training courses. It will be delivered by internal and external experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">With regard to the general question of appointments, secondment or lateral entry to either police service, the selection criteria, experience and eligibility for appointment will be determined in the first incidence by the commissioner and the chief constable. Nobody can serve here as of right. No member of the Garda Síochána can declare an intention to serve in Northern Ireland as of right. It is for the chief constable and the commissioner to make an appointment in either case. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the arrangements provided for in this Bill would in any way endanger anybody's human rights. On the contrary, they will have the laudable effect of creating confidence right across this island that the Patten report is being implemented step by step.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">This is one of our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. This legislation is urgently needed. I have already said that the police joint investigations legislation is coming through this House. I look forward to the day when under European Union law it will be possible for police services in both parts of this island to form joint investigation teams as well as the secondment with which we are dealing here. Co-operation between the police services north and south of the Border is at an all-time high and as a result there has been tremendous progress in addressing issues of mutual concern, including ongoing terrorism and organised and other serious crime on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">It is by the process envisaged in the Patten report that confidence in the policing service in both parts of this island will be built up and strengthened as time goes by. To people who sometimes talk about the Patten report and its implementation, I say that a cornerstone of that report was that the RUC should not be disbanded, but that it should be transformed into the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Those people who constantly ignore that aspect of the Patten report should remember that one of the cornerstones of the Patten recommendations is that there should be no disbandment. That point is always forgotten when convenient, but it is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">It is a process of transformation. The police forces on both sides of the Border are not perfect. The only basis on which they will go from strength to strength in future is by developing the foundations now in place. The point was made earlier that we need an all-Ireland police force and that this is a transitional step. In some ideology that may be so, but what we have signed up to in the Good Friday Agreement, and what we expect of others, is that the steps I am currently putting before the House will be put in place and that we will build on the building blocks of the PSNI and the Garda Síochána and make them fully inter-operable.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I have attended a number of conferences and events which did not simply involve playing football or engaging in ice-breaking gestures. The intensity of the relationship between the two police forces is deepening all the time. Conferences such as the one held recently in County Cavan are of huge importance. Day-to-day co-operation between the two police forces, such as has been evident in recent days, preventing mass murder being committed by terrorist bombs in the Derry and Louth areas, is of huge importance.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Young people of Nationalist and republican backgrounds should be encouraged to join the PSNI in Northern Ireland and to take their part in the building of genuine policing in their communities. Rather than prevaricate, withhold support or stand on the sidelines, the time has come for people to tog out for the Good Friday Agreement in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">There have of course been setbacks. The failure to have elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly is a grave disappointment and one which caused grave misgivings for the Government and most, if not all, Members of this House. The Government elected by this House is nevertheless determined to proceed with all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement as best we can. By going ahead with this measure and with the police joint investigations team, and all the other practical steps of co-operation, we are showing that nobody, in a paramilitary group or anywhere else in constitutional politics, has a veto over the determined statement of the Irish people. This asserts that the Agreement made on Good Friday, put in place by the Irish people and approved by them in two referenda, North and South, is the only basis of which further progress will be made on this island. It will be implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I am not in the business of holding back or moving backwards, or engaging in tit-for-tat withdrawal of our full and wholehearted commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. We are delivering on our side of the deal. I urge everyone in this House to abandon the tit-for-tat approach whereby someone refuses to do one thing if somebody else does not do another. I urge all in this House to assert that we will deliver our side of the bargain because in terms of moral force and political leverage, to go ahead with our side of the bargain in an unreserved manner is the best way to deal with intransigence. To adopt the proposal suggested by the Sinn Féin members in this House would be to play straight into the hands of people who want to derail the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_602">This is a comprehensive, wide-ranging and necessary Bill. As someone who comes from the Dublin North-West constituency, I have more than a nodding acquaintance with landfill sites. As far back as 1950, the Finglas and Cabra areas experienced the despoliation of badly managed landfill sites by Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council. I speak with some direct experience, if not authority, on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I draw the attention of the House and of the Minister to an issue of which at least one Deputy on the Opposition side, namely, Deputy Joe Higgins, is aware. There is a phenomenon in the Dublin area, which may well be experienced in other areas, whereby significant numbers of cars are systematically dumped on the side of roads on the periphery of the city. There is a particular problem in Dublin in that the dumping takes places on the boundary between Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council. The car dump in my area is located near Dunsink Observatory, which is administered by the council for advanced studies, which was established by the Department of Education and Science and Dublin universities. There are up to 4,000 car bodies in the dump. Will the Minister consider introducing a provision on Committee Stage whereby the Waste Management Act 1996 or a related Act would be amended to permit local authorities to remove car bodies from the periphery of the city? There is confusion in regard to powers provided under the Planning Acts, the Waste Management Act and the Litter Pollution Act. Even though there is a task force comprising representatives of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and the Garda, it is unable to satisfactorily prosecute the perpetrators of this activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I have consulted officials of my local authority, Dublin City Council, in regard to aspects of the legislation and, rather than ranging all over the place, I will hone in on a number of specific issues. The fly tipping of builders' waste has reached epidemic proportions over the past year or so along side roads in city areas, namely in Ballymun, Darndale, Coolock, Finglas, Blanchardstown, Cabra, Clondalkin and Tallaght. It was thought that much of this activity had been addressed by the introduction of waste permits. However, the legislation in this regard is inadequate to deal with the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I ask the Minister of State, therefore, to consider introducing a requirement that all advertisements, including those printed in the <i>Golden Pages</i>, by persons promoting a waste collection service must contain the collection permit number of the person or company involved and making it an offence for such advertisements to be carried without a valid permit number. The current system is not adequate. Local authorities have a problem with advertisements in the <i>Golden Pages</i> and in local newspapers, particularly free sheets that circulate in the Dublin area, by persons offering a waste collection service and providing only a mobile telephone number as a contact point. Dublin City Council suspects that most of the material collected by these persons or companies is dumped illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Section 14 of the Waste Management Act could be strengthened through a number of measures. Local authorities have the power to halt and board vehicles but it should be clarified whether this power also extends to stationary vehicles. Local authorities have the power to order the driver to take a vehicle to a designated place and hold it for such a period as may be necessary for its purposes. There is a serious flaw, operationally, in ordering the driver to take the vehicle to the designated place. If we wish to have effective enforcement, the authorised officer should also be specifically allowed, if it is considered necessary, to impound the vehicle at the road side and have it removed to a designated place. The owner should be made liable for all towing and impoundment costs and these should paid before the vehicle is released. These recommendations have been made by a task force comprising local authority officials and the Garda. The power to impound stationary vehicles should also be clearly stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It may be said that these powers are excessive but it is the only way to deal with unauthorised hauliers. They disappear when they drive to the designated place, despite the carrying out of late night enforcement operations. It is impossible to ensure in most cases that the vehicles reach the designated place. If what I propose was included in the legislation, the procedure outlined would make it difficult to avoid going to the designated place.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I refer to the level of fine outlined under section 10 of the Waste Management Act 1996. It provides for a fine of £1,500 or €1,905 on summary conviction. There is significant work involved for a local authority in bringing such a conviction and this level of fine is not a deterrent. The level of fine should be increased significantly and I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue so that the fine and the maximum prison sentence are increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The exemption specified under section 39(7)(<i>d</i>) of the Waste Management Act 1996 should include the deposit of waste from litter bins, road sweepers and clean up areas into compactors at local authority depots. This would exempt such facilities from the requirement to obtain an EPA licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Section 14 of the Act does not allow a right of entry to a premises unless the authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing there is a risk of environmental pollution or that such has occurred. That is borne out in practice as the local authorities work with their hands tied behind their backs. This section has been used against local authorities when prosecutions have been brought under packaging regulations. The judge, in a number of cases, did not accept that the packaging waste on the producer's premises gave rise to a risk of environmental pollution. The rights of entry need to be made more explicit and should include entry rights to investigate whether breaches of the Waste Management Act 1996 or regulations made thereunder have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Can abandoned cars be specifically included in the definition of litter? There is a problem in terms of what constitutes a abandoned car. Is it a car that lies on the side of road for a long time with a number plate? If the number plate is removed, is it in a different category?</p>
          <p eId="para_612">It should not be necessary to retrieve evidence for litter prosecutions involving objects discarded from cars. That provision is proving to be an anomaly. Records held by individuals or companies that are required for compliance with the Waste Management Act 1996 or regulations made under the Act should be admissible as evidence in court in all prosecutions and there is a serious doubt as to whether this is the case currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There is a number of other issues but I will communicate with the Minister of State directly on them. A great deal of tightening up is required to ensure the legislation is as enforceable as it should be. We thought that much of the previous legislation in this area had solved all our problems but, regrettably, it has not. We should try and get this as right as we can this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">When we debate environmental issues, we often refer to the phrase "minimise, reuse and recycle."  It is a compact phrase that rolls handily off the tongue. However, in statistical terms, there is not enough of it happening. While that is nothing to be proud of, a great deal of good work is being done by a number of people. Until we as citizens decide we want to do something about these issues, we will not get far. It is all right to put legislation in place, as we can address any issue and legislate it to death, but someone must enforce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">We should have enough pride in our own country to want to see it looking well. Domestic waste and items such as cars, washing machines and fridges should not be left in our most scenic areas. We do not want to see our rivers polluted by raw sewage and animal excrement. We all have a role to play and we must decide to do more than we are currently doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Much work is being done. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced that €55 million would be made available for the environment fund this year and significant funding has been given for capital works. When one compares what is being spent this year with the last operational programme one sees how funding has increased. This gives us an incentive to encourage local authorities to rise to the challenge they are offered. The Minister is providing the money and local authorities should draw it down. I was critical of my county for not having a project on the drawing board for the last round of capital applications. I was amazed that a county which is progressive in many ways, particularly in relation to the environment, did not make an application. However, I believe County Donegal is in the process of putting together an application for the incoming round of funding. I trust it will be met with approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In my constituency there is a new waste station in Carndonagh which has a facility for most types of waste. The disposal of cars has been a huge problem in the recent past. Cars which had failed the NCT were being driven at high speeds and in a reckless fashion and burned out in the middle or on the edges of roads or on forestry land. In the very recent past it appears that the price of scrap metal has gone up and there is a rush to get these cars off the roads. It might help Deputy Carey to examine the issue of the scrap value of cars. I hope things have changed since we had a clean-up in recent weeks. Although we have a waste facility in Carndonagh people still drive miles to abandon waste. It is a sad day when people put rubbish in their cars and drive to scenic areas to dump it rather than use the facility provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">This brings us to the core issue of paying for a service. I disagree with the campaign in Dublin of non-payment of waste charges. If people do not share the load the facility cannot be provided. I believe one must pay a little for a service to appreciate it. I agree with the Minister's action in granting the power to discontinue the collection of waste from people who are not paying the charges. I believe strongly in fair play. Those who create a little waste should not have to pay as much for its disposal as those who create a lot. The pilot study in Cork to weigh waste is an important step forward and should be followed. People should get credit for minimising their waste and for using recycling facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Donegal County Council has put many initiatives in place. The tidy towns scheme is doing much to raise standards. I would like to see more support for volunteers. The Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, of which I am chairman, will consider volunteerism at its next session. State agencies cannot do everything on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I am a member of a county council and I know the difficulty faced by councils in making decisions regarding the siting of waste management and sewerage facilities. We often baulk at the challenge of deciding where such facilities will be located. For every 50 proposed sites there will be 50 pressure groups. It is important that hard decisions are taken and that we move things on collectively. It is only if we work together with the support of funding that we can make a better country.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I would like to hear the contributions of Opposition Deputies but I do not think sharing my time would be of any advantage. We will all be together on Committee Stage and we will use the time then. I will need ten minutes to respond to the contributions of Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I am struck by the fact that a small number of provisions took up most of the Deputies' time. I take it, therefore, that the vast bulk of the proposals in the Bill is non-contentious and, in most respects, welcomed. This gives us a good basis for Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I highlight a comment by Deputy Allen, who said that legislation is one thing and implementation is another. I could not agree more. Many of the Bill's provisions tackle that very issue. Let us take, for example, the question of empowering local authorities to decline to collect domestic refuse where the householder has not paid for the service. This is a question of enabling the local authority to implement the law in the most straightforward and simplest way possible. The current position which forces local authorities to continue to collect waste from those households which have not paid their waste charges sends a clear signal to those in default that their inaction is acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">I sat through the debate and did not interrupt any speaker. It is not my nature to interrupt others and I demand the same respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">It is akin to telling a person he can have his day in court some time in the future but in the interim his refusal to pay will not be challenged. This situation might be acceptable to some but it is not acceptable to this side of the House, nor is it acceptable to those people who pay their charges. Law abiding citizens – people who pay are law-abiding – should not be expected to subsidise those people who will not pay up.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The proposal to make it an executive function to set waste collection charges is a matter of implementation. Waste charges are a fact of life. They are necessary if we are to achieve a modern and efficient collection and disposal service. In this connection, accusations were made about the Government's attitude to local government. The Government is committed to supporting and reinvigorating the local government system. For example, a major review of the funding system is being undertaken, taking account of the international experience. New financial management, human resources and IT systems are being put in place, together with increased emphasis on corporate planning and customer service. The sphere of local government influence is being widened significantly through the city and county development board process and new financial supports for councillors are in place, together with training and better back-up and a modern legislative framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Over the Government's term of office the programme of action to strengthen local government will continue and intensify. There will be further measures to improve local authority performance and to develop the role of the elected council as part of this process. Accordingly, there is no lack of commitment to local government or local democracy and it is wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">With regard to waste charges, Deputies have, deliberately or accidentally, overlooked the fact that local authorities are empowered, under section 103 of the Local Government Act 2001, to consider and adopt annual budgets. This long-standing process is not being changed by the provisions contained in the Bill and local authority members will continue to carry out this very important function for their local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Under the Bill local authority managers will have the power to determine charges for waste collection and disposal, but the level of charges will continue to be decided locally and, in particular, following consultation between the manager and elected members in the context of adoption of the annual budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I remind Deputies that the waste management plan is a key instrument in ensuring the country gets the waste management infrastructure it needs. Deputies will be well aware that finalisation of these plans was not without difficulty. It involved people exercising their responsibility and making hard but necessary choices. This applies equally to those elected members of local authorities who adopted plans and to local authority managers who had to act in the absence of agreement from members.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">While plans need to be kept up to date, there is no merit in revisiting the foundations on which the plans are based. We cannot allow uncertainty to creep back into the waste management planning system. Inaction will inevitably lead to inertia. We need to keep the focus firmly on delivering modern waste management infrastructure and services. That is why it is proposed to make the review, variation or replacement of a waste management plan an executive function, exercisable by local authority managers. This will ensure that plans, many of which were adopted after considerable argument and debate, will not be overturned or altered in ways that set at nought their fundamental objective, that is, the putting in place of modern waste infrastructure and services. Of course, there will be full public consultation with regard to any such variation or replacement of plans. The provision on waste management plans is a vital step and one that must be taken at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">There were suggestions that this Bill is a Trojan horse or some other exotic device to introduce taxes by stealth. In this regard I simply remind Deputies that every aspect of the Bill is open to the scrutiny of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Deputy Cuffe, in his contribution, wrongly suggested that the Bill promotes incineration as a panacea. The Green Party is well aware that national policies are firmly grounded on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, and this Bill is no exception to that policy. Prevention, minimisation, reuse and recycling are, and will remain, key priorities. What some people seem to have a problem with is how to deal with waste that cannot be dealt with under those preferred options and thus refuse to grapple with the realities we face. Such people are like ostriches. Failure to make provision for properly constructed and managed thermal treatment facilities and residual landfills will mean the ostriches will find themselves burying their heads in rubbish rather than in sand.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_646">The issues we have been discussing show a stark contrast between the approach taken by the opposite sides of the House. The Government is prepared, and duty bound, to make hard choices on implementation and to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">This is why the Bill provides for a substantial strengthening of Ireland's environmental legislation. At its core is provision to bring our integrated pollution control and waste licensing systems, already among the most advanced in operation in the EU, fully into line with EU legislation. Issues relating to the directive will be fully dealt with in Committee, but I should point out that we are transposing a European directive so we must comply with its fundamental provisions and mandatory requirements. I am sure Deputies will bear this in mind on Committee Stage, both in terms of submitting amendments and in considering the explanations that will be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Specifically on the issue of IPC licences, Deputy Cuffe raised a point about appeal mechanisms against proposed determinations by the EPA. Complex technical and specialised issues may arise in applications for IPC licences, therefore it is appropriate that decisions on such applications be taken by a highly expert, independent body. The EPA is that body – it has developed considerable experience in IPC licensing over the past eight years – and there is provision for comment on draft EPA decisions before they are finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">A number of Deputies referred to climate change. As the House is aware, Ireland has an emissions growth limitation target of 13% over 1990 levels under the Kyoto Protocol, reflecting our need for economic development. Our Kyoto obligations arise in the commitment period 2008-12. The Government's National Climate Change Strategy, published in November 2000, comprises a systematic programme towards meeting these obligations and sets a ten-year policy framework for achieving the necessary emissions reductions.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">While measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our obligations, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must now be intensified. Meeting our target is an important Government commitment. Accordingly, a review of implementation of the strategy has started and we intend to ensure more focused and intensive action towards full implementation over the remainder of the decade, including pursuit of any additional measures which may be identified in the review. In the broader context, I reiterate that the focus of our efforts for the environment must, at this stage, be on action. When this Bill is passed we will have the strongest environmental legislation this country has ever seen. With this in place we will have the opportunity to better and more fully tackle the environmental challenges we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Deputy Carey made reference to a number of issues. He spoke about permits on advertisements, whether in the <i>Golden Pages</i> or elsewhere. We must examine this, and whether stationary vehicles must be considered the same as vehicles on the move.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The increasing of fines is included in the Bill. In addition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will later this year introduce a fines Bills which will then ensure that fines, right across the spectrum of Departments, will be increased regularly on an index-linked basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Deputy Keaveney importantly referred to the fact that we are custodians, that we should have pride, and that, while we can enact all the legislation we like, at the end of the day it is important we create the awareness that Ireland belongs to the people, not to the 166 Deputies. All of us, collectively, have a responsibility to ensure we pass on this country in a better environmental state than we received it. If it is not possible to improve it, then we should maintain those very high standards if we can achieve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I wish to share with the House my experience today in County Leitrim presenting green flags. A number of Deputies and leaders of parties have made such presentations at schools. This is an ideal programme introduced by An Taisce, with which we in the Department work. That is where we must start. If I had found a sweet wrapper today, it would have been impossible to present the green flag.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">There are 269 schools involved in the green flag programme. I applaud what they have done and I would try to entice more schools, both at primary and secondary levels to become involved. If the schools did so, some of the litter problem would certainly be resolved.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_680">If there is any advantage in it for Tallaght, I am prepared to wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The Irish people are involved in a magnificent adventure this week. They are playing host to people with disabilities from around the world and, in the process, learning, experiencing and discovering. In a world of commercialism and crass exploitation, we are learning the meanings of true competition and pure and unadulterated sport, we are experiencing the ways in which people overcome barriers to demonstrate ability above and beyond the norm, we are discovering that people with disabilities are capable of courage, grace and skill that we can only envy and we are seeing what it really means to overcome. The atmosphere surrounding the Special Olympics World Summer Games has encouraged a sense of celebration and discovery. We should be grateful for the work and effort of the organisers of the games, as their commitment and dedication to the myriad of tasks they have undertaken are lessons for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Against that background, one of the most shameful things about this Government has been the mean-spirited way in which it has dealt with the issue of disability. I will return to the subject later, but it is appropriate to begin this evening by pointing out that the community that has organised the events we are witnessing and reached out to people with disabilities from all over the world deserves a Government of vision and generosity. It has, instead, been foisted with this miserable Government, which was elected on the basis of lies and deceit, is interested in power for power's sake and does not possess a shred of moral authority. It is appropriate, therefore, as the House nears its summer recess a year after Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats took office again, that it should debate how the Government parties have lived up to their promises and how citizens have benefited from their return to office.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I emphasise that the Government's performance must be compared with the promises made by the Government parties when seeking re-election. The Government's extensive back-up apparatus has made sustained and persistent efforts in recent weeks to suggest that its performance may be judged only against the programme for Government and not against the bogus promises which won it power. I do not mean to imply that the Government has honoured the programme for Government – far from it – but the electorate did not vote on the basis of the programme. Its decision was based on the very explicit commitments of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats at election time, some of which are listed in the motion I have moved. It is not possible to exaggerate the significance for hundreds of thousands of people of commitments such as the elimination of hospital queues by 2004, the extension of medical card eligibility to 200,000 people, the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí and the funding of 40,000 additional child care places. Such hard commitments were pressed on the people by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">When the Government started to churn out its various works of fiction in recent weeks, the Progressive Democrats Party sought to resile from any proposition that it was involved in breaking promises. Deputy Liz O'Donnell claimed that it was all the work of Fianna Fáil and said that the Progressive Democrats, as a party, tend not to make such promises. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 5 June last dealt explicitly with the commitments made by the Progressive Democrats. I will leave this issue by mentioning that the Progressive Democrats manifesto stated that it “will increase the strength of the Garda Síochána by 2,000 members”. The Progressive Democrats, having made their share of commitments, cannot pretend that all responsibility rests with the larger Government party. There has never been an instance, in the history of the State, of political parties engaging in such a comprehensive and cynical post-election turnabout and consigning undertakings solemnly given to the political dustbin immediately after their election. A particularly central undertaking, given on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was that there would be no cutbacks, secret or otherwise. This was cynically advanced before polling day and contemptuously abandoned within days of the result.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The main reason why the Labour Party has put this motion before the House is because it believes it is right and appropriate that the Opposition should subject the Government to audit at the end of each year in office. This Government abhors accountability and seeks to avoid it at all costs. Its most determined campaign this year was conducted to secure the filleting of the Freedom of Information Act and its leaders' most assiduous efforts are devoted to avoiding detailed questioning in any public sphere. That includes this Chamber, sadly, in the case of both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">I will not be able to refer to more than a few of this Government's depredations in the time available to me. I have had to make selections because the Government has made matters worse in the last year in almost every area of this country's economic and social life. Its only achievement is to be able to say that it has affected every walk of national life in such a short period. The tragedy is that it damages everything it touches.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Government has shown itself to be, undoubtedly, one of the worst Ireland has ever had. In its first year in office, it has broken dozens of promises made to the electorate, attempted to distort its record in office, launched a series of savage attacks on essential elements of public spending, introduced a raft of increased and new charges and expected the most vulnerable people in society to bear the cost of its incompetent economic management. That is what this motion seeks to capture.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Many Government backbenchers fully, if privately, accept the charges and the demands contained in the Labour Party motion. Yet these Deputies will, in the end, shame themselves as democratically elected public representatives by acting as lobby fodder to support the Government amendment to the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Some few on the Government benches, even office holders, have publicly in their comments and remarks, to all intents signed up for the thrust of the motion. Yet, they too will, in the end, shame themselves by also voting for the Government amendment. Among such will be Deputy Tim O'Malley of the Progressive Democrats, a Minister of State who just the other day was a loud protester at the behaviour of the Department of Education and Science, the Minister and former Minister in the case of St. Nessan's primary school in Mungret. St. Nessan's is, of course, in the Minister of State's constituency. It is a school with a complex of ancient temporary classrooms in a notorious state of disrepair. These rooms are, in his words on RTE radio, "totally unsuitable, they would not pass safety standards". He is right. I have seen this school, as it happens, having recently visited it with my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. However, it is no worse than a number of others in respect of which similar undertakings were given.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">My constituency colleague, Deputy O'Connor, is the lone Government backbencher in the House. When he was a candidate in the general election he caused a letter with the Taoiseach's imprimatur to go in the doors of every house in a large section of my constituency pledging that long-promised refurbishment work in Kingswood schools would commence immediately after the election. Nothing has happened since then. This is just one more example.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Anybody who visited St. Nessan's with Deputy O'Sullivan knows that Portakabins do not come cheap. On 8 April last in answer to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Wall, the Minister revealed that last year the rental cost of these temporary classrooms for primary schools alone was €8.4 million while the purchase cost was €17 million. There are 166 primary schools renting temporary classrooms and an unknown number have had to purchase classrooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I recently visited Lucan with my colleague, Senator Tuffy, to meet with local people trying to cope with the consequences for their schools of explosive local population growth arising from a flood of badly planned and poorly controlled housing developments. Such has been the uncontrolled expansion of Lucan – the largest in the country according to the census – that in recent years many families must send their children to schools outside their community. The fabric of the community is being destroyed by bad planning, the hallmark of Fianna Fáil, and inadequate resources afforded to schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Another example taken at random is a secondary school, Castleknock Community College. In 1998 Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised this school a purpose-built gym and other facilities to cope with the large number of pupils. Now, although these facilities were promised and had gone to planning and through various other steps in the Department's labyrinthine procedure for permitting building work, nothing has happened to date. In the context of the Government cutbacks in education, the school is now left in no-man's land on the waiting list of work to be completed. That scenario is repeated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">In my constituency, Firhouse Community College is almost an identikit of what happened in the case of Castleknock Community College. Again, solemn undertakings were given by the Government. There is no Progressive Democrats candidate in the constituency since the departure of the Tánaiste into exile in Dublin Mid-West. Fianna Fáil pledged that the long-promised sports hall for Firhouse would be built. However, nothing has happened. All around the country communities have been let down by the Government in a similar fashion. Although, according to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who first made the promise to the people of Mungret in 2001 that St. Nessan's was going to be sorted out, the people who have really been let down are those in the Government. As he put it the other morning on RTE radio when being pressed on St. Nessan's: "The Government was let down because the money ran out." The money ran out, as Tommy Cooper would say, "just like that".</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_698">The feeling of disillusionment all around the country is no surprise to any Deputy on either side of the House. On 27 November last year it was revealed that the Health and Safety Authority was then investigating unsuitable conditions in as many as 34 primary schools around the country. On 8 and 9 of April, my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, proposed a motion specifically highlighting the situation with the schools building programme. During that debate Deputies on the Government side of the House drew attention to appalling examples of schools neglect. However, education is only one area.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">One of the first cutbacks made by the Government – one of the earliest signs of what was to come – was the announcement on 29 June of last year of a €32 million cutback in the foreign aid budget. A month later this cut was increased to €40 million. Deputy O'Donnell, then a former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, described how she had to fight to protect this budget during her term in office. Last September she told <i>The Irish Times</i> that she had to lie across the overseas development aid budget. She said she had to sit on it like a hen to protect it from all invaders. When Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats left the hen-run the foxes immediately struck. The budget she fought to protect was cut at the stroke of a pen. What will Deputy O'Donnell do when the division is called tomorrow? On what side will she cast her vote? I do not think we even need ask. Nor do we need to ask on what side her colleague, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will cast his vote. We know.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">We know that the Government will win the vote tomorrow night, with the support of all these Deputies who will criticise it in the corridors, in the bar, in the newspapers anonymously, on radio and television occasionally. In the media they are strong, forthright and critical. In the lobbies they are sheep, but the actions of the Government, the blatant blather of its counter motion and the whipping of Deputies against their best instincts, the spirit in which they were elected and the truth that they know, is no real victory. No one today believes a word or an utterance that escapes the mouth of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and those Ministers and Deputies who go along with and echo the banalities and the clichés of the leaders of this awful Government. The Government told massive untruths to citizens to get itself into office. Just over a year ago at the general election citizens were deceived in the most calculated electoral fraud perpetrated on Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">According to the official figures published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the average price of a new home in Ireland is now over €200,000 and the average price in Dublin is €267,000. In order to buy a house at those prices, a couple would need an annual income of €60,000 or almost €80,000 if living in Dublin. In the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, the rate of increase in the average price of a new house has been five times the rate of inflation, more than four times the increase in average earnings and more than three times the increase in the cost of building. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have presided over six years of profiteering in the housing market and, especially, in the price of building land, all of which has been paid for by house buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Given the scale of the housing crisis, one would expect a re-elected Government to address the problem in the interests of home buyers, the tenant and those who are waiting for social housing. Instead, this is its record since its return to office. The Government has abolished the first-time home buyer's grant; increased VAT on building land by 1%, thus increasing the price of houses; handed back 16,000 affordable housing sites to the builders; cut the budget for social housing by 5% in money terms and almost 20% in real terms; allowed housing lists to increase to almost 50,000 while the number of homeless people has doubled; introduced a Residential Tenancies Bill three years after it was recommended, with a provision that the landlords register will not be shown to the Revenue Commissioners. I know the media, being overworked, does not get around to small points of law, but that is actually in the Bill, that the register may not be shown to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_705">This is a Government which, to get elected, fraudulently promised a year ago that it would put 2,000 extra gardaí on the streets – again, in Tommy Cooper's style, "just like that". This is a Government which promised that, on re-election, it would, again like magic, issue 200,000 new medical cards, bringing comfort and security to thousands of families fearful of going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. We have a Taoiseach who, to get his hands back on power, with the Minister for Health and Children, promised to eliminate hospital waiting lists within two years. We now know that during all the time they were making these promises, they were secretly planning the cutbacks on public spending that would be unveiled as soon as the election was safely out of the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">This also is a Government which, with its cutbacks and mismanagement, priorities, ideological bent and excuse that "the money ran out", is doing untold damage to public services. Perhaps nothing more clearly and graphically illustrates this than the story on health. The health system is in a shambles. Yet it has been lavished with resources so that we are now close to average EU spending. The annual health budget at the beginning of the 1990s was in the region of €1.5 billion a year and it is now almost €9 billion a year. This is taxpayers' money. Irish people have paid for a world-class health service and system, but the Government has not delivered what Irish citizens have paid for. It has delivered chaos, queues and closures.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">However, while the Government makes us pay for a world-class health system on which it refuses to deliver, it still finds time to look after its friends, as we saw in this year's Finance Act, with its cool little tax break for investors in private hospitals. Now, we are to have more "reform" of the system, or so we are told. It is, apparently, to be made even less accountable, more remote and probably more expensive. When all the new quangos have been established, their principal merit, in the eyes of the Government, will be that there is someone else to blame.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Of course, our health system needs reform. It needs the sort of reforms that put patients at the centre of the service, the sort of structures where the money follows the patient. It needs reforms that put an emphasis on human dignity, that recognise the right of people to be treated quickly and efficiently when they are in pain. Reforms that tinker with administrative structures, while ignoring the crisis that faces thousands of people on a daily basis, are meaningless. If a chief executive in the private sector made a presentation like that to his shareholders, how long would he last?</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Apart from the hospital service as such, Ireland's community care service is, increasingly, a shambles, unable to provide the support elderly people need and to which they are entitled. It is unable to respond to the needs of young mothers or people with physical and sensory disabilities. It is unable to offer children the guarantee of protection that a civilised society would take for granted. In the area of intellectual disability, there are media reports, day after day, demonstrating how such people are capable of beating the world. Other stories demonstrate how people with disabilities have united communities, created a fantastic atmosphere around the world's largest sporting event and given a lead to other countries in this European Year of People with Disabilities, but their Government sneaks around like a thief in the night, refusing to publish the rights-based legislation it has categorically promised, refusing to make the meagre resources available that would prevent essential services from tottering into crisis. The Taoiseach will preside over the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics in Croke Park on Saturday night, but he will not act to prevent vitally needed services from closing down.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Government is also inflicting serious wounds on the economy. With its policy of stealth taxes, hikes in public service charges and stoking up of consumer spending, inflationary pressures have been intensified and competitiveness damaged, and now we have continuing pressures on the cost of living and an appreciating currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">One area particularly affected by this mismanagement is the area of housing, to which I have already referred. The truth is that in a remarkably short time and against the ironic background of greatly increased prosperity, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have made home ownership a luxury. They have sided with property investors and land speculators against home buyers and tenants. They are making young home buyers and tenants pay for the Government's fiscal mismanagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Disadvantaged communities are also being forced to pay. On 8 February 2001, the Taoiseach announced the RAPID programme, designed to fast-track resources to "the 25 most deprived urban neighbourhoods in the State for special treatment, involving the front-loading of State investment in facilities and services to bring about a major improvement in the living standards of the residents in these areas over the next three years". A further 20 areas were subsequently designated. The impression given was that, once a plan was settled on, through the complicated structure prescribed, there would be no shortage of funds to support plans advanced from these areas. Now that those areas have brought forward the plans, there is no money to support them. The Government has pulled out from under its commitment. RAPID was a cleverly chosen acronym, with the purpose of communicating action in transferring significant resources to areas of disadvantage. It worked well in winning votes in the run-up to the last general election. However, now that the election is over, the Government pulled the rug on the most disadvantaged communities in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I wish to refer to the Taoiseach's speech to the IMI, in which he pointed out "We have to get our cost and price inflation down to 2% or risk losing jobs and markets." Yet, a range of commentators, including the Central Bank, have shown how the Government's own policies are the direct cause of between 1.5% and 2% in price inflation this year, before any other sectors of the economy are taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Nothing could put the situation into sharper focus than the 80 page litany of self-pitying claims published by the Government recently in the guise of a progress report. I said at the time, and I repeat, that the Irish people might believe they are more entitled to an 80 page apology from the Government in view of the way they were so seriously misled by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats during the election campaign. These absurd attempts to rewrite political history – the Government produced three in about two weeks – only add insult to injury. If the Government approached the implementation of the national development plan with the same enthusiasm it has shown for producing reports attempting to defend its own record, the country might not now be in the mess it is. Perhaps more to the point, it is surely time the Government recognised the deep distrust and contempt with which it is viewed by a majority of our people. One year into office, it is widely accepted as a total disaster. In the fullness of time, its dishonesty, incompetence and arrogance will all combine to make a sorry epitaph for the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and many Ministers have a barely suppressed anger at the notion of people calling them to account in relation to the promises they made in the run-up to the last general election and their performance in this, their sixth year in government. The Government is angry and the reason for its anger is that people are letting it know, in no uncertain terms, how cheated they feel by its behaviour. The air of injured innocence adopted by the Taoiseach, on the basis that all politicians made promises and that "we were only doing our best", does not deceive the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">People who have experience of the sheer anguish and confusion of waiting in an accident and emergency department for hours, or even days, are equally angry. This is happening in a health service where, time and again, the Taoiseach and Ministers continue to repeat that never has so much money been spent on the health service. However, the silent reply from people is that never has so little been achieved with all that money. Ireland has had a series of wake up calls regarding the state of our economy. Some weeks ago the chairperson of the American Chamber of Commerce in Dublin straight from Boston and the east coast of America told us that unless we pull up our socks in terms of competitiveness and unless we address our infrastructural deficit, we will lose out in attracting inward investment. We will also put the sustainability of existing jobs in doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is on record as saying he is managing the economy for the long term – that he is in a marathon, not a sprint. This is at odds with his record. It is a strange marathon runner who covers 26 miles in a combination of fast sprinting and exhausted tottering. The Minister's record is one of squeezing spending immediately after one election, and then splurging before the next. This was the pattern during the first FF-PD Government. He is now, once again, cutting back spending, building up the war chest and waiting for the next big splurge.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">This is management of the economy for the basest political reasons, but it is terrible economics. It has meant that the economy was overheated at the height of the boom, with high inflation and job losses being the direct result. Now that the economy is at a low point, the dip is worse than it needs to be because the Government is cutting back on spending and diminishing consumer confidence. This is evident from consumer confidence indicators, such as that produced by the ESRI and IIB Bank. Over the economic cycle as a whole, this boom-bust economics means lower growth, higher unemployment and higher inflation. What we need are sustained and sustainable improvements in public services and sound economic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">If the Minister was really interested in the long-term management of the economy, he would not be cutting back on the national development plan. One of the least well-noticed cuts is the reduction in the target for capital spending on the plan from 5.5% to 5% of GNP. The difference is about €500 million a year, and over the lifetime of this Government it would amount to €2,500 million, or twice this year's budget for the National Roads Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The failure of the national development plan is about more than money. It is about poor economic management, which pushed up inflation when resources were being put into the plan, and about poor political management. If the Minister for Finance put as much energy into the national development plan, for which he has responsibility, as he does into poking his nose into the Department of Health and Children, we might have at least one continuous motorway connecting two of our principle cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Investment in infrastructure is the basis for non-inflationary growth in the future. While the appreciation of the euro may cool off Irish inflation, the economy will not grow to its potential without high inflation unless the infrastructural deficit is tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Government would have us believe that it is not responsible for our economic woes, as though the international downturn could be responsible for inflation that is twice the EU average. It will try to take credit if things pick up, but it is doing lasting damage unless it progresses the national development plan now, and if that means borrowing, so be it. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, are on the record as saying that we are under-borrowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The tragedy is that they are squeezing current spending to pay for the infrastructure they are building, rather than prudently borrowing. Current spending is being cut to pay for capital spending, for which the Taoiseach and Deputy Harney accept it would be appropriate to borrow. In the meantime the national pension reserves are being invested in falling equity markets right around the world while our national infrastructure, whether it is roads or railways, is being starved.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">We have a revenue problem and an amazing shortfall in revenue. It is not possible to sustain modern public services on a low revenue base. The revenue side is showing the cumulative effect of tax shelters for the rich. We have low income tax rates by European standards. The problem in Ireland is our very narrow tax base, just as it was 30 years ago at the time of the tax marches. Whole sectors of the economy are sheltered from paying their fair rate of tax. The architects of the tax shelters for the rich and the very rich have been the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, Deputy Harney, the Taoiseach and the other right of centre members of Government. Many of the tax shelters emphasise investment in property. This, in turn, has had the effect of boosting property prices beyond what is reasonable or safe in an economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Some 33 tax breaks were created by the Government for which we do not even have costings. We do not even know what tax breaks, such as that regarding stallion fees, cost. If the Government was to fulfil any of its promises, even over the five years of its full term of office, it would have to address the inequity and unfairness of our tax structure.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_727">Last Friday a ceiling collapsed in a school in my constituency. It caved in on top of a class of children and their teacher who were lucky to escape injury. One child who was directly under the section of the ceiling that collapsed had his hand up to answer a question. If he had not been doing so, he probably would have been seriously injured.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">One might have expected some reaction to such an incident – some sense of urgency, provision of emergency funding or an inspection of all the schools that are substandard and all the old prefabs around the country, but there was none. The biggest reaction I noted was two Ministers of State in my constituency trying to outdo each other to dodge the fallout from what happened when that ceiling collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">In the meantime the school is trying to get on with business. The children in that class cannot go to school. A protest will take place at that school tomorrow morning to try to draw attention to what is a most serious problem, which could have ended in serious injury. It seems to be impossible to evoke any sense of urgency among the Members opposite, even when an incident occurs such as the caving in of a ceiling.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The reaction of the Minister for Education and Science was that this school would not jump the queue and get ahead of other schools on the list. St. Nessan's school and all the other schools on the list are not trying to jump the queue; they are trying to move it forward. Some 60 to 70 schools are in exactly the same section of the queue as St. Nessan's school and they are going nowhere. They are on the "maybe next year" list. Maybe their needs will not be addressed next year; they may not be addressed for several years – they do not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The collapse of the ceiling in St. Nessan's school has not made a blind bit of difference to the priorities of the Government. There is no general inspection of old prefab and substandard schools. There seems to be no extra capital fund or concern about the promises made to schools in Mungret, Wexford, Littleton, Tallaght, Donegal, Tullamore and all of the other places up and down the country, to which many of the Members opposite made promises and said the money was there. In the case of Mungret, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea,—</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_733">—announced €2.15 million in 2001 and, as my party leader said, he seems to be quite perplexed that the money has disappeared and none of the Members opposite know where it has gone. It is not their responsibility, they are washing their hands of it, but they are in Government; they are in power. They are the ones who ultimately have political responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Do the Members opposite know that there are puddles on the floors of a school in Oughterard; that there is unsafe electricity in a school in Newbridge; that there is a condemned school in Bantry with no hot water and no heat or light in the toilets; that there is no school for hundreds of children in Lucan; that the rat holes in one school in Kerry are blocked up with pencil cases; and that there is a school in Kilfinane in County Limerick in respect of which I have received several letters, from one of which I will quote a sentence. The letter states, "In so-called modern Ireland my child has to brave all weathers to use an unheated toilet, an outhouse, where conditions are further exacerbated by a lack of hot water facilities."</p>
          <p eId="para_735">What we are asking the Taoiseach, Deputy Harney and members of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil for is some reaction. We are asking them to find the money. This is the most basic of infrastructural needs in any country. It is the place where most of our children spend their waking hours, yet the Members opposite are sitting there as if nothing has happened and there is no need to do anything. There is something simple that they could do. They could provide funding for substandard school buildings and fulfil the other promises that were made, some of which I am about to talk about in education and others to which members of my party have already referred and will refer later in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">As my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, has already pointed out, a number of actions could be taken in the financial area. We heard today that €15 million is to be spent on renovating the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The purchase of the Government jet could be cancelled, various loopholes could be closed in the tax system and so on. The money invested in the stock market for contingencies up to 2025 could certainly be reduced. Something must be done – the Government cannot just bury its head in the sand and pretend it is not its responsibility. People believed what was written in the manifestos. They believed Deputy McCreevy when he said no significant overruns were projected and no cutbacks whatsoever were being planned, secretly or otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">The cutbacks and increased charges started within a month of the election and they have mounted up week after week and month after month throughout the Government's first year in office. My colleagues will refer to several of these.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">In education, it began with a 70% hike in the registration charge for third level on 18 July. A cut in IT courses followed on 29 July. A total of €36 million was taken out of the education budget on 13 September, which included the school retention programme, the back to education programme, second level buildings, research and development in institutes of technology and teacher recruitment and training. On 14 November, the capital budget was cut for education in the Book of Estimates. On 2 December, part of the school capitation grant was frozen. On 12 December, restrictions were imposed on the guidelines for support for children with special needs. The summer jobs scheme was abolished and the school building programme revealed the broken promises of the Government. The back to education allowance was curtailed. This week and next week, children with special needs are leaving their current places and have nowhere to go. That is what has happened in the area of education but cuts have also been made in many other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should know that people are angry about the broken promises, but they are even more angry about lost opportunities. The wealth that was built up in this country was absolutely squandered. People thought they would see services being built up; they thought they would see the fruits of the Celtic tiger. Now we are witnessing all the old problems that existed before the wealth was built up. We see the same waiting lists and the same problems with school buildings. In effect, we have seen no improvements, despite all the wealth that was created. All this happened during the lifetimes of the previous and current Governments. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste must take political responsibility for this fiasco.</p>

This was not an Irish phenomenon. Across the eurozone, growth in the last quarter of 2002 was half that of the previous quarter. At home, growth in the second half of the year was about one sixth of what it was in the first quarter. Uncertainty abroad inevitably affects a globalised economy such as ours. Indeed, a downturn in Germany has on average twice the impact on the Irish economy that it has on the rest of the EU.</p>

We said that our priorities would include improving infrastructure to ensure our sustainable growth in the future and that is what we are doing.

I acknowledge that the pace of delivery has slowed. I know there is frustration that the unprecedented pace of increase in public spending over the past few years has had to be moderated. Some plans remain to be fulfilled and some ambitions are not yet realised. This is not the time to give up. Neither is it the time to be panicked into rash responses—</p>

          <p eId="para_808">The Labour Party would have reversed the progress of the past five years. Under Labour, this was and would have been again a country of high taxes, high unemployment and a high national debt. It is the Government, not the Opposition, that is persevering in more difficult times. It is the Government that is wisely keeping its head and sticking to its policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">In Sustaining Progress, the social partners have agreed with the need for sensible action. The NESC recognises that we are experiencing economic vulnerabilities generated by factors largely outside our control. With the support of the social partners, we are committed to pursuing policies that achieve growth, sustain high levels of employment, bring about lower inflation, have sustainable public finances and bring a sharp focus on improving our physical and social infrastructure and a fair approach to distributing economic rewards. Sustaining Progress provides for managing the public finances in a way that ensures a sustainable match between resources and expenditure so that as the economy returns to full its potential, which it will, current public expenditure rises no faster than GNP and the debt to GNP ratio continues its gradual decline. That is precisely the strategy we are pursuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Although the economic climate has changed around the world, one thing has not changed. Ireland remains a leader in achievement and in growth. Our GDP per capita was recently recorded at 122% of the European Union average. Our unemployment rate at close to 4% is well below the European average. Germany is now over 10%. Our national debt to GNP ratio is the second lowest in the European Union. If we can keep that place and keep ahead of the pack, then we will, over time, deliver the services that people want. I do not discount our problems and, above all, I do not underestimate what we have yet to do. However, neither must we underestimate ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">We know there are still major challenges ahead. We know that although waiting lists are down and times are shorter, too many people still have to wait for too long. That is why in our health strategy we did not just say we would spend more and continue to employ more staff, but we want to reform how the health services are delivered to our people. Tomorrow the Government will publish its plans for reform and I am sure the Opposition will support it following what Deputy Rabbitte said tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">I ask for just one thing. I ask that the people in the health services who sought change will now support that change. I especially ask that other political parties who have been so concerned about health, who have had so much to say about health and who have so often demanded radical reform, will now add their voices to the need for change. Politics, including local politics, has to stop at the door of our hospitals. Patients have to be put first and change will come now. I hope we will get support for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Difficult times test the mettle of real leadership. In the short-term, there will be no easy solutions and no quick fixes. Progress, though hard won, will be steadily achieved. Day in, day out, for every day of the remaining four years of our mandate, the Government will work to implement its programme. It will protect the prosperity that we as a nation have begun to build together. It will hold its nerve and stick to its course. We will realise the ambitions of our people and we will leave a lasting legacy that will be built on solid foundations.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">Political commitments are based on economic assumptions. My party, the Progressive Democrats, based its election manifesto last year on the belief that the Irish economy would grow at an average rate of 5% in real terms up to 2004. The other parties in this House made similar assumptions about the national economy. All such assumptions were based on a broadly favourable international outlook. They were based, in particular, on the expectation that the incipient recovery in the US economy would be sustained and that recovery would take hold shortly in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Things have not worked out like that and the coalition has faced a very tough international climate during its first 12 months in office. The US continues to grow only modestly at just over 2%. Many of the large European economies are effectively stalled and it is estimated that the eurozone as a whole will grow by just 0.8% in the current year. It is in this context that the performance of the coalition over the last 12 months should be assessed. The Irish economy has performed well by international standards in a very difficult climate. Yes, growth levels have fallen and this has put pressure on Government revenues but Ireland remains one of the strongest performers in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The most important achievement of the Government has been to maintain the Irish economy at full employment. The most recent quarterly survey from the Central Statistics Office – for the quarter to February 2003 – shows how resilient our economy is. The number of people at work is up on the same period last year by 1.3%. The unemployment rate stands at just 4.6% and the rate of long-term unemployment is still just 1.4%. These are impressive figures, particularly when one looks at what is happening elsewhere in Europe. Across the four largest members of the eurozone, unemployment rates range from 9% to 11%.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The Government faces a range of challenges over the next four years. It must deliver significant improvements in public services. It must provide enhanced supports for all those who depend on social welfare. We must transform our public infrastructure. The real political question – the issue which goes to the very heart of political debate in this country – is how one sets about achieving those objectives. There are still those who believe that raising taxes is the way to solve the country's problems. They say the rate of capital gains tax is too low, the rate of corporation tax is too low and the top rate of income tax is too low. In short, they believe it is by increasing taxation on investment, enterprise and employment one achieves social and economic progress. I disagree fundamentally with this view.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">There is a view that the role of Government in Ireland is too small and that it needs to be increased through additional Government spending funded by additional taxation. This is simply not true. The level of Government spending in Ireland as a percentage of GNP is broadly in line with other OECD countries and provides no basis for higher levels of taxation on work. It is widely accepted by international commentators that the significant reductions in direct taxes of recent years have been a major factor in our economic success.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">We have reduced taxes on investment, enterprise and employment. The net result has been a substantial increase in employment and a dramatic reduction in unemployment and the amount of money we are spending on services. Health spending, as Deputy Rabbitte acknowledged, has increased from €3 billion to €9 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_852">The Irish people do not want to take chances with full employment. They do not want to put at risk the huge economic progress, which we have made over the past ten years. We have an economic strategy that has delivered full employment and that works. We will stick with that winning strategy over the next four years.

We must reform our public service. Our experience with health shows that investment without reform will not deliver the dividends we require. The Government has invested massively in health – current spending on health this year will be €5 billion higher than it was in 1997.</p>

The challenge is all the greater in Ireland because, unfortunately, we lack the broad-based consumer lobby that should provide political support for pro-competition initiatives. Virtually every proposal to increase competition in the Irish economy is met with entrenched opposition from those with a vested interest in the <i>status quo.</i> If we are serious about economic progress and social justice we, as politicians, must be prepared to take decisive action on behalf of consumers.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_969">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Today I have the privilege, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, to present to the House flagship legislation, the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003. It is one of the most important housing Bills to have been brought before this House in many years and the most comprehensive reform of the residential private rented sector in Ireland for almost 150 years. This Bill updates the legislation applying to the private rented sector. It brings overdue protection for tenants in terms of rent reviews and much needed security of tenure. It gives landlords and tenants an effective means of resolving disputes that arise between them. It addresses some long-standing deterrents to investing and residing in private rented accommodation and will lead to greater professionalism within the sector. The Bill will thus enhance the contribution of the private rented sector to meeting the housing needs of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">The Residential Tenancies Bill is the result of a productive collaboration between my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office. There has been a high level of anticipation generally about its publication and those with a genuine interest in improving the private rented sector will welcome it. It is a large and fairly complex Bill, involving changes to many long-standing aspects of landlord and tenant law. Its production was an efficient job, resulting in a balanced, comprehensive, innovative and imaginative Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">As we begin consideration of the Bill, it would be useful to place it in context. The Government recognises the vital importance of the private rented sector in the overall housing market. This is reflected in the priority accorded in the current programme for Government and in the recently concluded partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to reform and develop the private rented sector, which is a tenure of choice for an increasing number of our people. It also facilitates mobility, which is a growing feature of the labour market, and it can help to address social housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Recognising these factors, but aware also that the sector was not reaching its potential, the previous Government established a Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector to examine the workings of the landlord and tenant relationship and to make recommendations in relation to the sector. This Bill implements the recommendations made by that commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">It is important to stress that the commission was a widely representative group of relevant interests, the 18 members of which signed up to the measures contained in the Bill. The commission's recommendations did not fully meet all the demands of the competing interests in the sector, and that was to be expected. These demands are born of differing views about the relative rights and responsibilities of those who provide rented accommodation and those who live in it. Consequently, the Bill does not contain everything that accommodation providers and renters might like. However, it strikes a fair and reasonable balance between those demands and it provides a framework for a stable, effective and efficient private rented sector. This, in turn, will encourage further development and growth in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The Bill is the core element of a wider programme to develop this segment of the housing market in Ireland. The commission recommended fiscal reforms in relation to the private rented sector. Tax reliefs were provided for in the 2001 and 2002 Finance Acts by allowing mortgage interest and refurbishment costs to be offset against rental income. We will also explore other possible means of promoting the development of the private rented sector, including increased investment and greater professionalism. For example, I am keen to explore the potential of public private partnerships in the rental accommodation area, particularly in the context of social and affordable housing. Within the Department, a private rented sector unit has been established to help progress these initiatives, with the development and implementation of this legislation, and to give a more focused approach generally to the development of policy for the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">There is a strong inter-relationship between the different elements of the housing market. Development of the private rented sector can contribute to the achievement of overall housing policy objectives. Equally, the availability of a sufficient number of properties for rent is dependent on the provision of new houses generally. The Government has implemented a range of measures in recent years to respond to an unprecedented escalation in demand for housing. Various supply side constraints that we inherited in 1997 have been tackled and we have greatly increased the range and depth of response to social and affordable housing needs. Above all, housing output has been increased to a level that would have been deemed unattainable half a dozen years ago. Almost 58,000 houses were produced in 2002, which is about 24,000 more than under our predecessors in 1996. The scale of this achievement is illustrated by international comparisons showing Ireland not just heading the field in terms of output relative to population, but leading most others by a distance.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The link between the different elements of the housing market is demonstrated by the situation that developed whereby many prospective first-time buyers living in rented accommodation were effectively pushed to buy earlier than they needed to because of the high cost of rent. Meanwhile for some, the increasing drain of rent costs was moving the home ownership target further away. The past 12 months have seen a welcome change. Supply of rental accommodation has increased substantially and rents have moderated and even reduced in certain segments of the market. The huge progress we have made in increasing overall housing supply greatly enhances the potential of the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">This Bill will help to ensure that this potential is realised by providing the legal framework for an efficient, attractive, vibrant and responsive private rented sector. It will reform aspects of landlord and tenant law that have been problematic. It introduces a measure of security of tenure, specifies minimum obligations applying to landlords and tenants, contains provisions relating to rent setting and review and provides for the establishment of a private residential tenancies board to undertake a number of key functions within a reformed private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I will now outline some of the main provisions of this interesting Bill. I was both a tenant and a landlord in previous years. It is some time since I was a tenant and although I was a landlord more recently, I am not one currently. It was my parents' original home for a short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Part 1 contains the usual general provisions, including the scope of the Bill. The provisions of the Bill do not apply to certain types of rental arrangements, including holiday, employment related or business lettings, formerly rent controlled dwellings, or long occupation lease tenancies. Furthermore, it does not apply to social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I refer to Part 8, which deals with the establishment of a statutory private residential tenancies board, because this board is relevant to many of the other provisions in the Bill. I will mention it many times as the tenancies board or the board. The board will have the key role of providing a statutory dispute resolution service. It will also have responsibility for tenancy registration, research, and the provision of information, policy advice and guidelines in relation to the private rented residential sector. The bulk of the provisions of Part 8 are standard matters relating to State bodies. There are also specific provisions for the appointment of mediators and adjudicators to enable the board fulfil its dispute resolution functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The board will have a pivotal role in the operation of this legislation and its effectiveness will have a major bearing on the success of the new regime. An <i>ad hoc</i> board is in place, preparing the ground for the statutory role, and helping to inform the development of the legislation. I pay tribute to its members for this work. A number of them also served on the commission, including the chairman, whom I single out for special mention. Mr. Tom Dunne's contribution to the reforms we are implementing has been incalculable.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Part 2 specifies for the first time in statute law certain minimum obligations of landlords and tenants, regardless of whether there is a written tenancy agreement. Landlords are required to maintain the structure and interior of the rented dwelling to the standard existing at the commencement of the tenancy; to insure the dwelling; to allow the tenant enjoy peaceful and exclusive occupation; and to reimburse tenants for expenditure on repairs appropriate to the landlord. It also places an onus on the landlord to enforce tenant obligations. Third parties will have recourse to the new tenancies board, where necessary, to ensure this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">For their part, tenants will be subject to a number of specific legal obligations. They must pay the rent and other charges specified in the letting agreement. Other obligations will include requirements to ensure no act or omission causes the landlord to be in breach of his or her obligations; notify the landlord of any repair requirements; do nothing to cause the dwelling to deteriorate beyond normal wear and tear and, if it does, to make good such damage; not to engage in or allow anti-social behaviour; and not to assign, sub-let, alter, improve or change the dwelling without the written consent of the landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">Part 3 provides that the rent payable may not be greater than the open market rate and may not be reviewed more than once a year, unless there has been a substantial change to the nature of the accommodation. Rents may be reviewed upwards or downwards. Disputes about the rent charged or arrears of rent may be resolved under the dispute resolution procedures of the tenancies board. Some might have difficulty with the concept of making market rent the legal benchmark. This was an issue subject to considerable debate by the commission. It considered that the market rent approach would be the most appropriate system for this country. In arriving at this view, it had regard particularly to negative experiences with more rigid forms of rent control, especially in terms of its impact on new supply and maintenance of the existing stock of rented accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Indexation of rent, for example, by reference to the consumer price index, is an alternative approach that has been suggested. However, this has many of the drawbacks of rent control and results in the front-loading of future rent increases to the disadvantage of tenants entering into lettings. A system of indexed rent levels would also mean tenants would be charged approximately 5% more in rent this year than last, whereas rents for lettings in certain segments of the rental market have recently been falling, by as much as 20% to 25% in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">In adopting the commission's proposals regarding market rent, we were also mindful that, unless accommodation providers can get an adequate return, there will not be investment in rented accommodation and there will not be a healthy private rented sector. No model is guaranteed to work perfectly at all times but it is important that the market works as efficiently as possible and delivers a fair deal and value to tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">One of the roles that will fall to the new tenancies board will be to monitor and research trends and developments in the sector. This will include reviewing the operation of the legislation. It will be in a position to consider at first hand the issue of rents and examine distortions that might be encountered in relation to a particular case or category of accommodation or a particular area and take such distortions into account in determining a dispute over rent. The board will also have power to make recommendations to me in regard to the operation of this and other aspects of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">Part 4 introduces a greatly improved level of security of tenure for tenants. This will be based on a four year cycle whereby tenancies will be deemed to be terminated at the end of each four year period. This does not preclude the tenant remaining in occupation but, if he or she does, it will be under a new tenancy. This new cycle of tenancies will start for existing tenancies from the commencement date of this Part. It is not backdated. During the initial six months of any tenancy the landlord will be free to terminate without giving a reason. Once the initial six months have passed, the tenant will have a qualified right to remain for a further three and a half years. A tenancy that has been in existence for more than six months will be known as a "Part 4 Tenancy".</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I use the term "qualified" because the owner will have a right to reclaim the property for justifiable reasons such as own or family occupation, sale, change of use or major refurbishment. These grounds are essential to basic property rights and encourage participation in the sector by accommodation providers. Naturally, the tenancy can also be terminated in the event of failure to comply with the tenancy obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">Some might prefer a longer security of tenure provision and this might well evolve as the new system becomes established and accepted. As with other issues in the landlord-tenant relationship, there are conflicting views in regard to security of tenure. However, the four year cycle was the commission's judgment, at this point, of a fair balance between landlord and tenant interests and between the need for adequate security and encouraging investment in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">It must also be remembered that the new system represents a major advance on the present position of a virtually absolute landlord right to terminate, subject to only four weeks notice. There will also be a specific safeguard to ensure landlords do not abuse the right to reclaim possession. If a landlord terminates a tenancy on grounds that subsequently transpire to be false, the tenant can refer the matter to the tenancies board and compensation of up to €20,000 may be awarded. Unlike landlords, tenants will always be able to terminate a tenancy, subject to giving the required notice, without having to specify reasons. The Bill will not force tenants to remain in a tenancy for four years or any set time.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Where a sub-tenancy is created, the sub-tenant will be treated as if the sub-tenancy commenced on the same date as the original tenancy and the sub-tenant will have the benefit of the remainder of the former tenant's security. Where a tenancy is assigned, a new tenancy is created and the assignee tenant will commence the six month qualifying period. There are also specific provisions covering situations of a dwelling occupied by multiple tenants that can give rise to difficulty. These include a means to ensure a bad tenant in a multiple tenancy can be removed without unfairly ruining the other tenants' renting arrangements. Termination of a tenancy, regardless of the reason or who is doing the terminating, must be by notice. Part 5 introduces a graduated scale of notice periods for terminating a tenancy, increasing with length of tenancy from four weeks initially to 16 weeks after four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Of course, longer notice periods than those specified can be given and shorter notice periods are also provided for in certain circumstances, such as failure to comply with tenancy obligations or serious anti-social behaviour by either party. In addition, it is open to the parties, but only when one has advised the other of the intention to terminate, to agree between them any shorter notice period that suits them. Disputes in relation to termination notices may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Part 6 of the Bill introduces a completely new framework for dealing with disputes arising between landlords and tenants and this will be a major function of the board. At present, if a landlord and tenant are in dispute, the only options available to them are to end the tenancy, endure continued disagreement and unhappiness or refer the matter to the courts, which can be a confrontational, costly and very lengthy process. It would not be too wide of the mark to say that the present situation can play into the hands of bad landlords and bad tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The new dispute resolution mechanism through the tenancies board will be more accessible, affordable and user-friendly. Any dispute arising between landlords and tenants of dwellings to which the Bill applies may be referred to the board, which will largely replace the courts in this area. It will operate a two-stage dispute resolution procedure, with the first stage consisting of either mediation or adjudication. In the first instance the parties in dispute will be offered the services of a mediator. This will give them the opportunity to resolve matters in a friendly way. Both parties will be helped to examine the circumstances and facts of a dispute. The mediator will help them to think through the problem and to choose a solution that will work for both of them. The mediation process will be supportive, non-confrontational, confidential and speedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">A mediation service is already available nationally on the basis of joint voluntary referral by landlords and tenants and I hope that landlords and tenants in dispute will, whenever possible, choose this route. It is clearly better to reach a mutually agreed solution than to have one imposed by a third party. However, should either of the parties decline the services of a mediator or if the dispute is not suitable for mediation, an adjudicator will be appointed. The adjudicator will investigate the issue in dispute, hear the evidence of both sides and issue a determination on the matter. Both the mediation and adjudication procedures will be confidential.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">In the event that mediation fails to resolve the dispute or issues remain outstanding, or should one of the parties reject the adjudicator's determination, the matter can be referred to a tenancy tribunal to be established by the tenancies board. The tribunal will be composed of three persons drawn from the board's dispute resolution committee, which will be formed for that purpose. The tribunal's proceedings will be public and its determinations published. Its determination of a dispute will be binding on the parties and may be appealed to the High Court only on a point of law. Enforcement of any determination orders that are not complied with will be through the Circuit Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The dispute resolution procedures to be followed by the board are set out in the Bill. They have been refined and developed by the <i>ad hoc</i> board. The mediators, adjudicators and members of the dispute resolution committee will be drawn from various professional backgrounds and areas of expertise, particularly with experience in landlord and tenant issues and-or mediation, adjudication or arbitration skills and competencies. They will be appointed for a period of at least three years on terms and conditions to be determined by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Part 7 of the Bill provides for a new system of tenancy registration. The 1996 registration regulations oblige landlords to register rented dwellings with the local authority. This system has not worked well. The level of compliance has been low. To be fair, local authorities have faced difficulties in the form of legal challenges to registration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">In future, landlords will be required to register details of all tenancies with the board, which will maintain a public register but this will not reveal the identities of the landlord or tenant, or the rent. The board will supply appropriate details to local authorities for the purposes of their role in enforcing standards and rent book regulations in the sector. I will return to the issue of accommodation standards presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">It is intended that funding from the registration fees paid to the board will be distributed to local authorities to support their enforcement activities. The fee of each registration will be €70. However, a composite fee of €300 will be applied where a landlord is registering a number of tenancies in the one building at the same time. The fee will be revised in line with general price changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">In cases where a tenancy lasts longer than four years a new tenancy must be registered at the start of the new four year cycle. The landlord will be obliged to inform the board of any changes to the tenancy. Failure by a landlord to register the tenancy where required to do so by the board will be an offence and may result in a fine of up to €3,000 and-or imprisonment for up to six months. Continued contravention may lead to an additional fine of up to €250 per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">I would encourage all landlords to comply with the registration requirements of this Bill. I fully intend that compliance with the law will be pursued. Non-compliant landlords will be identified and pursued and penalties applied. I hope this will seldom be necessary as there are practical benefits deriving from registration. In particular, access by landlords to the board's dispute resolution service will be conditional on registration. The data collected will assist the board in its dispute resolution activities, for example, in relation to disputes over rent levels. Therefore it is very much in the interest of landlords that this data be supplied to the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Furthermore, the Bill provides that the tenancy commencement date, which may be highly relevant in a dispute about the validity of a termination notice, is the date in the registration application, unless the contrary is proved. The registration data will also be very beneficial for the board's research and information functions. Information on the sector is currently inadequate, as was noted in the commission's report. Good quality information is essential to monitor developments and trends in the private rented sector and to provide a sound basis for policy formulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The Bill will provide for the exchange of relevant data between the private rented tenancies board and local authorities. The necessary section will be included by means of an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage. This provision will be subject to consultation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Data Protection Commissioner in the context of the intended use of the personal public service numbers of both landlords and tenants for registration purposes. Such use would require amendment of the Social Welfare Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">There has been comment in the media to the effect that the board should transfer personal registration data to the Revenue Commissioners. Local authorities do not have power to do this under the present registration system. Any provision authorising the Revenue Commissioners to seek such information would be more appropriate to taxation legislation. Revenue powers, which would include powers relating to information from third parties, are currently being examined by the Revenue powers group established last April by the Minister for Finance. I will have no difficulty with the board being subject to requirements that may emerge from this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">I mentioned already that funding from fee income will be distributed to local authorities to support their enforcement activities, particularly in relation to standards of private rented accommodation. Increased supply of new housing in recent years, with tax relief for refurbishment, is bound to have improved standards within the overall sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">However, I am certain that a proportion of accommodation is still substandard. It is not acceptable in the 21st century that any accommodation provider should offer a product that does not meet minimum basic standards, particularly when the product is to serve as somebody's home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Enforcement of the standards regulations has been patchy. Some authorities have taken a proactive approach, inspecting properties and taking legal proceedings where necessary, but many others have done little beyond responding to complaints. Demands generally on housing authorities have increased, but it is also a question of prioritisation. Perhaps some authorities still do not regard the private rented sector as being their business. This Bill should signal the need for change in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I am not advocating a heavy-handed approach or the deployment of an army of inspectors. Even if such resources were available, this would not be warranted given the considerable reduction in the age profile of accommodation generally in recent years. I believe we need an approach that is strategic, reasonable and effective, taking account of best practice by local authorities which have been successful in this area. All possible ways of promoting improvement in standards should be considered. This must, of course, include consideration of how enforcement can be made more effective. Enforcement action needs to be well targeted, for example, on segments of the market such as older properties where standards are more likely to be lower. Resources must also be deployed efficiently, including the potential for collaboration between authorities and information exchange where appropriate. My Department will, in consultation with local authorities and other interested parties, consider proposals for this type of strategic programme. It will also be desirable, in this context, to review the content of the regulations, which are now ten years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The board should have a significant effect in minimising the incidence of substandard rented property. The improved registration system will help in identifying the totality of properties for inspection purposes. In addition, tenants will, I am sure, refer disputes relating to standards to the board. In the past, tenants probably had concerns that if they raised the issue of standards a landlord might serve a notice to quit. With improved security of tenure provisions and the prohibition in the Bill against the penalisation of tenants, this should no longer apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">In order for the board to fulfil its dispute resolution functions, it must be able to rely on proactive co-operation from local authorities. I expect they will provide this but if it is not forthcoming from any authority, I will consider withholding funding that would otherwise be provided from registration income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Part 9 contains consequential provisions. The most notable is a provision to allow tenants to renounce their entitlement to claim a long occupation equity lease and the abolition, five years after the provision comes into force, of the entitlement to claim such a lease for the first time. These renewable leases of up to 35 years after 20 years in occupation of a tenancy arise under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980. This well-intentioned provision has proved counter-productive, prompting eviction of those approaching 20-year occupancy. I am sure all of us remember the difficulties that arose for tenants of the Mespil Flats some years ago. The changes now being made will prevent any recurrence of that sort and are necessary if successive four-year tenancies are to occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">There is also provision for injunctive type applications in the case of very serious emergency disputes coming before the tenancies board. This will allow fast-tracking of cases involving imminent danger to life or illegal evictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">This is a comprehensive, progressive and well-balanced Bill. It balances the needs, rights and interests of those providing rented accommodation and of those living in such accommodation. It introduces an appropriate level of regulation, but not over-regulation. It will give tenants a fair deal, without making unreasonable demands on landlords, something that could depress new investment in the sector. It will promote greater stability in the private rented sector. From that will come added confidence in the sector, on the part of tenants and investors, and expansion to meet housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">I will listen carefully to the contributions from Deputies on this Bill and consider any suggestions that I think will improve it and advance its objectives. However, I will not be prepared to dilute the element of balance, which I have stressed and which ensures that there is a great deal in the Bill for both landlords and tenants. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_639">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_1018">Before I address the Bill, I want to protest at the manner in which this Bill was introduced tonight. I am not alone in holding these views. Following the events of Friday, with the business of the House being abandoned due to the lack of a quorum, and the loss of time on the Protection of the Environment Bill, other Deputies and I reasonably assumed that the Protection of the Environment Bill would be given the necessary time to make up for the time lost on Friday. Instead the opposite was the case. There were guillotines, not only on the Bill from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but also on the Protection of the Environment Bill, which meant that we got less than half an hour to discuss, and vote on, that important legislation. The vote on Second Stage of the Protection of the Environment Bill was taken at 7 p.m. – amendments to that Bill must be submitted tomorrow morning in time for Committee Stage on Thursday – and this Bill was introduced at 8.30 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">There is a Minister and two Ministers of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with an army of civil servants, but the Opposition – both parties and the Independents – do not have the resources to match that pace of business and the unfair procedures that have been followed. I protest strongly at the manner in which the Government is ordering business in this House. It is almost a David versus Goliath effort, but then one must remember that David came out on top. Having said that, we will address the business of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">This Bill is introduced against the background that there are 50,000 families on housing lists throughout the country. In my city the number of people on the housing waiting list has exceeded 4,000 for the first time in the history of the city in my memory and that of those who have served on local government for a long time. It is introduced against a background in all cities and towns of poor quality rented accommodation, with Strumpet City conditions. There is poor, if any, enforcement judging by a survey carried out by one of the Sunday newspapers last September prior to the opening of the academic year, which showed that a big percentage of student accommodation in the city was below standard and did not comply with building or other regulations, and nobody seems to care. We have high rents, low standards and no enforcement by the authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I do not lay the blame entirely at the feet of the local authorities because this is about resources, and many local authorities do not have the resources to ensure enforcement. The Minister of State has responsibility to ensure those being exploited, many of whom are students, are not being screwed financially and that they get the accommodation which is in line with the demands on their lives. Academic life is stressful enough without having to live in substandard conditions such as those of Strumpet City.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Having said that, I welcome the Bill. It is a long overdue development in the housing legislation of this country. My party has been a long time calling for the Government to act in light of the changing housing situation. While the coalition Government has commissioned many reports, and even read some of them, it has been slow to act. Nevertheless, the Bill is better late than never.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">This legislation gives tenants the security of a four-year lease at the market rate. It obliges landlords to maintain property, while tenants must repair any damage caused and refrain from anti-social behaviour. It obliges landlords to legally register their property and threatens penalties if they fail to comply. It gives an assurance to landlords that their names will not appear on the public record nor will details be passed on to the tax man. It provides for the setting up of an official Private Residential Tenancies Board to resolve disputes. With just one in five landlords registered, the Government must provide a significant carrot to entice them. That carrot will be to allow them legally register their properties without exposure to the tax authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The need for reform in the private sector has long been recognised. The Bill is published against a background where the percentage of the housing stock available for rent has risen from 8% to 13%. This percentage increase is all the more notable because the total number of units has increased substantially. The housing situation is very different from that which pertained when my party left office in 1997. Back then, students could find accommodation relatively easily. They could pay for the places they found and there was hope of some day owning a property, but things have changed utterly. Because of exorbitant price increases, the rental sector is a more realistic option. Home ownership, still the ultimate goal of many, may have to be put off until later in life. It is only right that we frame an appropriate legislative response to changed times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Lest we underestimate the serious situation facing those in the rental sector and those wishing to enter the housing market, it is important that we are in no doubt about the facts. The first-time buyer's grant has been abolished. It was one of the many victims of the great election swindle of 2002. The little respite offered to young people to help them get a roof over their heads has been taken away and, to add insult to injury, there has been an increase in VAT on house prices. The cost of an average new home is approximately €200,000. That is 25% higher than in the United States and it represents a 180% increase on 1996 prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">During the 12 month period during which the Commission on the Private Rented Sector held its meetings, 12,000 people contacted Threshold, mostly on the issue of frequent and substantial rent increases. Health boards are paying rent subsidy to 100,000 people. Tenants have had poor security of tenure, while landlords have felt that many policy decisions were framed on the basis of poor and inaccurate information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">Nobody wins in the current situation and it is a shame that it has taken such a long time for the Government to act in the face of this growing problem. Those with the greatest need in all this are those with no home at all. The housing statistical bulletin states that there are 5,581 homeless people in this country. This is a national disgrace. It is an utter indictment of Government policy, a Government that inherited a boom in terms of available resources and promptly squandered them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The reaction of the groups outside this House who have an interest in this area must be borne in mind during this debate. Threshold has welcomed the Bill as a major step forward for both landlords and tenants. It states that it will redress the imbalance that operates within the sector, but has pointed out that loopholes exist that could see unscrupulous landlords, whom I contend are in the minority, escape the obligations the Bill imposes on them. Threshold has broadly welcomed the proposed measures. It stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The publication of the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 represents a historic day for landlords and tenants with the long overdue enshrining of basic principles on a statutory basis. Threshold believes that the Bill will have a significant impact in redressing the inequitable balance between landlords and tenants in the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">While Threshold is broadly welcoming the Bill there are key areas of concern that will need to be addressed and incorporated into the final drafting of the legislation. Threshold is concerned that security of tenure could be compromised by loopholes that undermine entitlements under the legislation, such as the unclear definition of anti-social behaviour and the ability to evict in order to refurbish. Threshold is also highlighting the absence of a clear reference to enforcing minimum dwelling standards and of strong measures to ensure full registration of landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">This is a critical issue given that currently less than one in five landlords comply with existing registration requirements. A further issue is that the cyclical six-month probationary period will leave tenants vulnerable to eviction without reason at the start of every four-year tenancy. Aideen Hayden, Chair of Threshold said: "Threshold have been campaigning and fighting for tenants rights for 25 years and the Residential Tenancies Bill represents an important step in improving the inequitable relationship that has existed for too long between landlords and tenants. We believe that a fair and well-regulated sector will contribute to and stimulate the growth of the sector and guarantee its future development into the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">I believe that is a reasonable and responsible response to the Bill. The first reaction of the Irish Property Owners Association was a little over the top. It described the Bill as flawed because it imposes inflexible, bureaucratic and unbalanced rules upon them. It stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The proposal for an automatic four year right to occupy following an initial six month tenancy period is contrary to the overwhelming tenant demand for flexible leasing arrangements. This one size fits all approach fails to recognise the complexity and variety of the residential letting market. An independent survey conducted by IMS-Millward Brown for the IBOA in May 2002 found that 65% of tenants would prefer to negotiate individual flexible lease arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The proposed compulsory registration and de-registration of each tenancy with the Board will be a bureaucratic nightmare. We fail to see what it achieves or what purpose it serves. We fully appreciate why local authorities should know where rental property in their area is located, but it is an exercise in pure red tape making for the Board to take on this function centrally. No other European country, where there are higher levels of rental accommodation, has such a burdensome system. If countries like Germany with 70% levels of private rented accommodation need no such bureaucracy attached to its dispute resolution process, then Ireland can survive without it too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I am not saying I agree with those issues but we must listen to all sides and consider their concerns on Committee Stage. The association stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">It was our clear understanding that the package of measures recommended by the Commission on the Private Rented sector would be implemented in a fair and balanced way. The Commission proposed several tax reforms on Inheritance Tax (CAT), pension provisions and other standard business reliefs designed to "encourage professionalism".</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I do not understand the meaning of that sentence. The legislation goes beyond what the commission recommended in many regulatory areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">I asked for a response from all the groups with an interest in this Bill. The Bill is complex and lengthy and the time between publication and the Second Stage debate is too short to allow for proper consultation with all the interested groups. It is in the interests of this House and of all concerned that we get it right this time. We have been waiting a long time for this legislation. I hope a sufficient period of time will be allowed before Committee Stage so we can consult with tenant organisations and the Irish Property Owners Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The IPOA says that this legislation, if passed in the form in which it is published, will damage the sector it seeks to support. While it welcomes some proposals in the Bill which are long overdue, it feels that a pre-occupation with centralised regulatory control will doom it to disaster. Successive Governments have failed to understand properly the needs and the operation of the private rented sector, according to the IPOA, and this lack of understanding has led to a succession of failed and harmful measures. The 1996 registration regulations never worked, existing legislation was tweaked and the measures in the first three Bacon reports sent rents sky-rocketing – mortgage interest relief was scrapped at a time when the demand for rental accommodation was at its highest. The net impact of these measures, coupled with the arcane notion that rental income is unearned income, drove investment out of the sector at a time of maximum need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">I view this Bill in light of the need for proper recognition of rights and responsibilities. As a representative of a party of the progressive centre, I reject the argument of those who seek to jump down the neck of those who own property in this country. It is easy to characterise all landlords as bad, but it is wrong to do so. Similarly, I reject the belief that the market is king. The right to hold and let property is accompanied by a responsibility to treat tenants with the respect they deserve and to grant them the rights they need – rights which are provided for in this Bill for the most part. A vibrant rental sector which is attractive as a medium-term option – not just as a short-term option as it is at present – is vital to the future of our economy. The rental sector needs to be fair to landlords, so that supply can be boosted, and fair to tenants, so that demand can be maintained. We need to root out exploitation, give people the protection they deserve and make the letting of property an attractive option.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Bill addresses the major areas of importance to the sector. I believe it will stand the test of time after it has been fine-tuned. The inconsistencies in the Bill must be ironed out before it passes through the House, however. The composition of the proposed private residential tenancies board needs to be spelt out more clearly in section 147. The board is central to ensuring that the spirit of the Bill is adhered to and that neither tenants nor landlords can abuse perceived loopholes. The Minister is free to choose whom he wants, as long as he deems them to have adequate experience and there is an equitable balance between men and women on the board. That does not ensure that there is a balance between landlord and tenant interests, however. I propose a balance of five representatives of landlords, five representatives of tenants and five impartial persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Section 148(2) allows the Minister to make a subjective decision to remove a member of the board at any time. This gives the Minister great power over the functioning of what needs to be an independent group. This seems to be at variance with what people expect from this legislation. When this provision is taken in conjunction with section 192, the Minister has the power, in effect, to rewrite the day-to-day workings of the Bill, subject to his own interpretations. This is unacceptable and contrary to independent board hearings and clear law-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Section 125 of the Bill refers to the publication of the registry details. Although it is acceptable that no information on the specific identity to rent amount is to be included in published accounts, there is concern that full taxes are not paid by all property owners on rental income. I have to ask why this Bill is not attempting to ensure this is not the case. The omission of such a provision is an important defect in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_1045">There have been significant reductions in certain elements of the tax base in the past ten years. Income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax have been reduced. There have been significant gains in the value of rent and capital values for property investors. It is in the national interest for the Revenue Commissioners to be given access to the registry and specific details to ensure compliance with tax laws. There is no moral or legal case for the denial of such access. If the Minister cannot accept such an amendment, he will invite the questioning of his agenda regarding this issue. The health service, for example, which will be the subject of much discussion tomorrow, will not fund itself. It is important for the less well-off to see that the better-off are paying their fair share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The number and broad nature of definitions of anti-social behaviour in section 17 could lead to a significant level of ambiguity and could lead to eviction simply because a tenant is not liked. Clarity is needed in this regard. Does listening to the radio constitute interference with peaceful occupation? Does smoking cause damage to persons living in a dwelling? Perhaps a different phrasing is needed to ensure reasonable justice in the implementation of this part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Section 16(<i>c</i>) does not specify how much notice a landlord must give for inspecting a premises or the recourse for a landlord that cannot get in contact with a tenant or cannot reach agreement about the date and time of inspection. Perhaps greater clarity of rights and responsibilities would resolve disagreements before they start.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">The Bill is a step in the right direction. It offers hope to younger people that renting their own home need not necessarily be fraught with worry. Given the level of house prices, it can only be a good thing if renting a home is seen as a viable medium-term alternative to home ownership. Bad landlords and bad tenants will suffer as a result of this Bill, but it will also mean that tenants will benefit from greater security of tenure. Property owners who run a good ship will benefit from tenants who see that they have responsibilities as well as rights. I have pointed out the flaws in this Bill and I hope the Minister of State will take heed of my concerns. The lives of everyone involved in the private rented sector will improve if certain changes are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The role of the Opposition is to examine legislation and to point out any defects in it. I object to the treatment of the House, particularly the Opposition, in recent days, when Bills have been guillotined or reshuffled. I do not mind if Ministers of State present Bills rather than their senior colleagues. Those of us on this side of the House have a responsibility to consult with and listen to those who will be affected by the proposed legislation. We make judgments on their views and then air the views we have formed following this consultation. This process was not allowed to take place on this occasion, when we were dealing with a landmark Bill. I hope time will be provided between Second Stage and Committee Stage so that all views can be taken into consideration. At the end of this process, I hope we will pass legislation which is important and which will give rights and responsibilities to all involved in this area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1052">Despite its unsatisfactory late introduction today, this Bill deserves to be welcomed. It has been long anticipated and long requested. The Bill was examined by an independent commission, a process which the Government has largely accepted. This is a good way of forming, introducing and agreeing legislation. For that reason alone, everyone in the House should welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Despite it being one of the better legislative proposals that the Government has introduced or is likely to introduce, it is not a perfect Bill. As Deputy Allen said, it is the role of Opposition to point out inconsistencies and flaws, and to debate and suggest necessary amendments. As the Bill proceeds through the House, that is a role my party will be happy to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">In terms of housing provision, the balance between those who own their own home and avail of private rented accommodation and those who avail of social housing is far different from that in any other European country, and there are historical reasons for that. Because that mix is so distorted the rental sector, in particular, has developed in a half-baked way. We have allowed standards here that would not be accepted in many other countries in respect of the quality of the housing provided in the rental sector and the ongoing administration of the private rental sector by both local government and central Government. This is an added reason the legislation is so welcome. It will, I hope, put in place the infrastructure that will allow us to bring about those necessary improved standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">It is heartening to see that the campaigning organisation which has been dogged in its pursuit of tenants' rights has given a broad welcome to the Bill. Threshold needs to be congratulated, not only for taking a positive attitude towards the legislation but for the ongoing work the group does in producing documents that help in housing provision. In the past six months alone, in combination with other organisations such as the Simon Community and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, it did an analysis of the housing plans provided by local authorities in the past year and provided an important critique of those plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">In recent weeks it provided a publication in conjunction with Comhairle, the citizens advice service, about the use of supplementary rent allowance which, as most people realise, is far from an aid to people seeking accommodation in the private rented sector but is more of a subsidy for people who own property and wish to let it. It suggested that the best policy approach is to introduce a form of rent benefit paid directly to those seeking tenancies so that the market can better define what provision is made for people and how it is done. I hope we will have a debate in this House in the near future that will improve the lot of those who seek accommodation through the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Mention has been made in the debate of the increased number of housing units that have become available, particularly in inner city areas, through the urban renewal tax designation. The Green Party would argue that this provision has not been without its difficulties. Because it has been taxation-led there are question marks in regard to the quality of the housing that has been provided. There has been a lack of proper regulation as to the social effects of placing so many units in given communities. My constituency office is in South Parish, which, technically, is in Deputy Allen's constituency, but the boundaries are blurred in that part of Cork city. There are other examples more directly in Deputy Allen's Shandon area where apartment accommodation was provided through the urban renewal scheme. Very often this is small in scale, housing of a type that undermines community life in the area because it gives rise to what I describe as a five to nine existence. People arrive in their accommodation at five o'clock in the afternoon and leave at nine o'clock in the morning. They have a Monday to Friday existence and do not interact in the communities where they are physically placed. That is something that needs to be examined in terms of general housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">There is much to welcome in the Bill, such as the security of tenure provision. As has been mentioned by Threshold, there are concerns in relation to eviction to refurbish and the definition of anti-social behaviour is very loose. I hope the Government will accept amendments on definitions on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">I welcome the dispute resolution mechanism, where there is currently a serious problem within the private rental sector. Unfortunately, it is too often left to organisations like Threshold to play a role that is not intended for it, in either challenging the issue directly or using other mechanisms such as local authorities to bring about resolutions of many of these disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Ultimately, the Bill seeks to establish the new national board, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which, unfortunately, seems to be a necessity. The Green Party believes that it would be better to regulate as much of this activity as possible locally. Experience has shown that there is a huge conflict of interest in local government, being both a housing provider and a housing regulator. Very often blind eyes have been turned and there has been a lack of willingness to enforce the legislation that was previously put in place in respect of the registration of landlords and of rented properties. To do so rigorously at local level would have resulted in local authorities adding to an already serious situation in terms of their own housing waiting lists and the need for social housing. If the new board helps to remove that conflict of interest it will do something useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">In progressing this legislation the Government needs to introduce further parallel legislation in respect of the relationship that exists in other areas of housing, particularly in social housing, not only between local authorities and tenants but in the increasing sector of housing agencies and tenants which is in need of proper definition as to the responsibilities of tenants, housing agencies and local authorities. There are inconsistencies in this regard and while people are more secure in that housing sector if they are fortunate enough to receive housing, they are still open to the type of conflict in terms of maintenance of the property and the quality of the housing they receive. As the debate proceeds I hope the Government will be prepared to take that side of the debate on board as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_645">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1062">It is our job to be critical of the legislation and put forward necessary amendments. I will leave the more positive elements until later. It is especially disappointing that legislation for which the people of this State have waited so long is so limited. People in private rented accommodation will have gasped in disbelief that legislation brought forward to reform the private rented sector does not tackle the fundamental issue of affordability. This is symptomatic of the Government's failure to tackle the crucial issues in terms of the housing crisis. We had an example of this previously when the coalition Government buckled to pressure from developers in respect to Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has shown he has no backbone in tackling rack-renting landlords. The Minister has sided with landlords, to whom regulation of the private rented sector is a matter of business, as opposed to that of the tenant, to whom it is a matter of their home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The Bill takes a very hesitant step towards redressing the inequitable balance between landlords and tenants in the private rented sector. Sinn Féin, though welcoming the fact that the Government has at last brought forward legislation to regulate the private rented sector, is disappointed by the significant shortcomings in the Bill. There are elements in the Bill which are blatantly unacceptable. This Bill fails to address a number of key issues of concern to tenants in private rented accommodation, such as the size of rent increases. The failure to address rent regulation and issues regarding affordability will seriously undermine the security of tenure provisions contained in the Bill. Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the provision in this Bill whereby rents applicable in the private rented sector should be at open market levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">I am amazed that the Government seems unaware that the most serious problem currently facing tenants in private rented accommodation is the issue of unaffordable rents. This Bill, in Part 2, section 24, defines market rent as "the rent which a willing tenant not already in occupation would give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling."  One can imagine a situation where a person who is looking for accommodation, perhaps with one or two young children, arrives on the door step and begins dealing with the landlord. How can this person be described as a willing tenant when in desperation for accommodation? Because of the scarcity of available accommodation they will be forced to accept whatever the landlord decides to charge. They will only be limited by their own ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Rent increases should be index linked, not market driven in a situation where, partially due to the Government's failure to tackle the housing crisis, demand far exceeds supply. This Bill, by its failure to address rent regulation, will defeat its own admirable intentions of addressing security of tenure. The limited security of tenure offered by the Bill will means very little to a tenant who is faced with a succession of substantial rent increases annually. It is within the power of the Government to control and set ceilings for rent but, of course, it is simply not interested in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">People who are caught in the vicious cycle of the private rented sector will despair at this Bill. Young people who are paying astronomical rent know they have no hope of getting out of the private rented sector because house prices are unaffordable. They know they will never be able to save the deposit because they are living from hand to mouth and from month to month as they pay these ridiculous levels of rent. In the last budget, the Government did not have any compunction about freezing the maximum allowable rent supplement, yet they refuse to restrict the ability of landlords to increase rent. That is hardly a level playing pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I now turn to one of the most striking disclosures in this Bill. The fact that this Bill specifically and categorically states that the landlord register will not be made available to the Revenue Commissioners makes an absolute mockery of any claim by the Government that it is committed to tackling tax evasion. To include in a Bill an element specifically to facilitate tax evasion is a disgrace. It demonstrates that the partners in this coalition Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, are unable to abandon their taste for corruption and illustrates that the Government condones tax evasion by landlords. How can anybody stand over such a provision in any Bill coming before this House?</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The requirement in Part 3, section 22, that only 28 days' notice of any rent revision be given is completely inadequate. Most people are paid on a monthly basis and would have great difficulty in meeting this requirement. Part 4 deals with security of tenure, to which I have already alluded briefly. We believe the four year limit on security of tenure is too short and does not take account of the fact that increasing numbers of households will be living in private rented sector accommodation for longer periods as the option of buying a house becomes more remote than ever. Sinn Féin does not agree with the proposal to allow a six month period, following the completion of each four year period, during which the landlord can issue notice to quit without providing a reason. It is unreasonable that a person who has been living in a particular dwelling for four years would be liable to be evicted, without reason, every four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Part 5, section 67, specifies the shorter notice periods applicable where the termination of the tenancy by the tenant is due to the landlord's failure to comply with the tenancy obligations. It states that where a breach by the landlord of a tenant's right to peaceful occupation involves behaviour that "poses an imminent danger of death or serious injury", the notice period is seven days. Would the Minister like to live under a threat of imminent danger of death or serious injury for a period of seven days? Would the Minister submit his family to such conditions? All of us know the answer to that. Let there be no mistake about it, the provisions of this Bill will subject parents and young children to dangers such as I have just described, and that is entirely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">We have concerns that security of tenure could be compromised by loopholes that undermine entitlements under the legislation, such as the large number of reasons for which landlords can evict tenants – for example, for refurbishment, sale or even use by family members. These are not justifiable reasons, as described by the Minister, and I ask that they be reconsidered. The provision in relation to anti-social behaviour needs to be further defined. While nobody wishes to accept anti-social behaviour in either the public or private rented sector, neither do we wish to allow further opportunities for excuses by landlords to evict tenants willy nilly. Sinn Féin welcomes the establishment of the tenancies board, which is long overdue. It will, I hope, be of assistance to tenants who, until now, have had nowhere to turn when they faced difficulties with their landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">People who, in the Minister's words, awaited this Bill "with a high level of anticipation"– I believe that was the term used – will be desperately disappointed. In the absence of measures to address rent regulation, I do not believe that this Residential Tenancies Bill will bring about a significant improvement in the position of tenants. I hope the enforcement of local authority tenancy registration will be tightened up. There would be little point in enacting this Bill if it were to simply rest on the Statute Book without being of any benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">I reiterate that the establishment of the board, at least as a resolution mechanism for disputes between tenants and landlords, as opposed to initiating court proceedings, is certainly very welcome and I look forward to seeing how that unfolds. I hope it will prove to be a cost effective and beneficial mechanism for resolving disputes between the parties concerned.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_646">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1073">I welcome the opportunity of commenting on this Bill. In this debate, I intend to put a different view, in defence of the interests of tenants. Phrases such as "security of tenure" in sections 25 to 55 immediately remind me of Michael Davitt and the Land League. Those great Irish men and women made such a magnificent sacrifice for the Irish people, particularly for the men and women of no property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Earlier this evening, I was astonished to hear the Government defending its record on waiting lists and housing and social policy. Tonight, I will try to carry on the tradition of Davitt. It is extremely sad that, after years of economic boom, a sector of Irish society is still in the grip of landlords, most of whom are home grown and seem to be obsessed by greed. For that reason, it is essential to remind ourselves of Davitt in this debate. Exploitation and injustice must be tackled. Legislators have a duty to protect the most vulnerable in our society. That is the purpose of this Bill as we need radical reforms of the private rented sector and we must ensure that our citizens are given their full civil rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">I strongly welcome section 14, which prohibits landlords from penalising tenants who have referred a dispute to the board. This is an important provision, preventing a landlord from bullying a tenant, a tactic which is used to a considerable extent by landlords to impose their way and intimidate their tenants, particularly those who might not have the social skills to defend themselves or know their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I find it extraordinary, at the beginning of the 21st century in a fairly prosperous Ireland, that we seem to have a major problem with the distribution of resources and wealth. Landlords and banks can rip off people, yet nobody seems to care. These are the awkward questions for society and they create tension. We look for leadership and guidance on these important social issues, but the political elite, the business sector, the church and the legal professions all had their credibility seriously tainted by damage and scandals. This is the Ireland of 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The reality is that most wealthy landlords in this State support the major political parties and they will always use their clout, money and power to push their own agenda. Hence, we must always be on our guard, protecting and defending our citizens. I have heard that view represented tonight. The Minister talked of balance, but I do not agree with what he said. This Bill should be balanced in the interests of tenants. I represent their views and the interests of tenants, not the landlords who have the power and resources to look after themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">I would like all of us to develop a radical, civic type of republicanism that believes in equality and justice. If one was to delve deeply enough into the problems of anti-social behaviour and binge drinking, one would note that there is a huge absence of civil republicanism, and this starts the day a child enters pre-school. We should ask the French about this. They start their civic responsibilities at an early age. This is a matter we should seriously consider in this debate in relation to landlords and property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">This debate gives us the opportunity to support tenants and to deal with the whole question of equality. Security of tenure is important. I have major concerns about sections 25 to 55 in that, during the first six months of each tenancy, a landlord will be free to terminate the tenancy without giving a reason. This takes away the rights and security, and sometimes the safety, of the tenant. This is dangerous and it leaves room for the bullyboys. I urge the Minister to reflect on these sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Section 19 prohibits an initial or reviewed rent from being set at an amount greater than the market rent. This is an important section. We need to be on our guard in relation to high rents and rip-off merchants. If a tenant was paying rent for a flat, apartment or house, he or she would deserve to be treated with respect and to be given a fair price. Let us tackle the recent disease of overcharging customers. It is widespread in Irish society, not just in the private rental sector. Consumers are being hammered and it is time to call a halt to this type of anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">In discussing this Bill, it is essential not to forget our homeless and all the people on housing waiting lists. We have seen a rise in the number of homeless nationally, from 5,234 to 5,581. They comprise 4,176 adults and 1,405 children. The highest level is to be found in Dublin where 4,060 people are homeless. We need to tackle this complicated issue head on. As a former full-time worker with the Simon Community, I believe we need to listen to groups like the Simon Community, Focus Point, the soup runners and co-workers on the ground when discussing legislation such as this. If we do not, we are going nowhere in discussing this Bill. We need an integrated strategy, back-up plans and resources, and then we can all sit back and think of Michael Davitt.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_647">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1082">I welcome this Bill, for which we have been waiting a long time. We are probably the only country in Europe that does not have proper protection for tenants in private rented accommodation. This is an important sector and legislation in this area has been long overdue. It follows from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, which called for significant reform of this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">The Bill is an attempt to reform the private rented sector. Some 120,000 tenants are in private rented accommodation. It is important that we recognise this is a step forward, however, it does not go far enough. There is a concern to ensure that the provisions of the Bill work properly. It is open to unscrupulous landlords to drive a coach and four through the legislation despite its good intentions. How will section 34 be policed? It is important that there is back-up documentation. It is not sufficient for landlords to state that they want houses, they should have to prove why they want them and that it is a legitimate need. What are the safeguards in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">There is a precedent whereby landlords are not particularly good at complying with legislation. Only 20% of landlords are registered. This Bill does not provide for landlords to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners. Failure to do so is a problem. Such lack of provision in the Bill shows a lack of resolve by the Government to do the business in terms of addressing the problem of unscrupulous landlords, the majority of whom do not pay taxes. There is a precedent of low compliance among landlords with legislation in this area, of which due cognisance should be taken in this Bill. Local authorities do not have the necessary resources to deal with landlords and to ensure their compliance with legislation. That should be addressed in this Bill to ensure compliance across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">The Bill seeks to ensure a more professional private rented sector. Its enactment would bring more money into the private sector. However, we should not forget the non-profit sector which is an important player in the provision of housing, particularly the provision of social housing by housing associations and local authorities, which is not covered in the Bill. Such authorities provide housing for people on the waiting lists in particular. It was mentioned that we do not want racketeering, as is prevalent in the UK, where landlords are totally unscrupulous and throw tenants out at will. Documentation will be crucial as a back-up to section 34. If a landlord was to use section 34 as a device to get rid of a tenant, it should be proven that he or she is bone fide in what he or she is trying to do. If a landlord put his house on the market, this section should not be used as a device to get it back again in some way or other. A landlord may say that he needs it, but he must need it for a legitimate reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">The Bill is about attracting greater investment in the private rented sector to build it up and improve it. If that were to happen, it would be welcome. The bottom line is that we cannot rely totally on private landlords; housing associations and local authorities must also play their part.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I question whether this Bill is being introduced a few years too late. It was long promised and the Celtic tiger has been and gone. Perhaps the provisions of the Bill will not achieve as much as they might have done a few years ago. People may believe that property is not as good an investment as it was previously. That will affect the efficacy of the legislation, nevertheless, it is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">My colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath talked about Michael Davitt. He dealt with the land issue, but the housing issue was not dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">The equity secured in the area of land was achieved in the area of housing. It is interesting that 80% of our population lived in private rented accommodation before our independence, but now 80% plus of our population live in owner occupied housing. The private rented sector has a long history. It is important and timely that this legislation is before the House, even though its introduction is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">I welcome the fact that the legislation puts a responsibility on the tenant as well as the landlord. It is important that tenants also bear their responsibilities. Landlords have been adept at getting their way and getting around the provisions of the legislation. It is, therefore, important that resources are provided to enable this legislation to be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">Some 80,000 students live in the private rented sector. They have an ongoing campaign for the provision of campus accommodation. If that group was taken out of the equation, much more private accommodation would be freed up. Approximately 6% of students live in campus accommodation compared to 28% of students in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">A reservation I have regarding this Bill is that the names of landlords will not appear on the public record or be passed on to the Revenue Commissioners. If we were to be ethical, we should be consistent, and there is a lack of consistency in that regard in the Bill. Landlords are prohibited from charging more than the market rate for rent, and this is to be welcomed. The penalty for non-registration, €140, is just twice the normal registration fee. This needs to be reconsidered.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
          <p eId="para_1095">I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for the opportunity of raising this issue, which is one of considerable importance to the people of Loughshinny. Since I am dealing with an educational matter, a little geography and perhaps history might not go amiss. For the uninitiated, Loughshinny is a small village on the north Fingal coast, equidistant from the towns of Rush and Skerries. Loughshinny is right in the middle of one of the areas of the country with the most rapidly expanding population. To me, it is something of a forgotten jewel. It is a most picturesque and scenic spot. I am beginning to sound like Deputy O'Connor when talking about Tallaght, but one could not imagine any place more unlike Tallaght. I say that with every possible respect – I keep looking around in case Deputy O'Connor comes in behind me. I do not know whether the people will thank me for mentioning it because it is an absolute haven, a beacon of tranquillity in County Dublin, and long may it continue so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Unfortunately, however, it has not gone untouched by the huge expansion in the greater Dublin area. The other morning I drove along the road near the local primary school and I counted 17 single houses being build within 400 yards of the school. This is the issue I want to raise, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity of doing so. St. Brendan's primary school moved into a new premises in 1989, at which time it had 167 pupils. That number remained more or less constant over ten years, but in the past four years it has suddenly increased by 25%, and the increase is expected to continue at least at this rate for the foreseeable future. In 1989 a magnificent new school premises was opened, with accommodation for six classrooms for those 167 pupils and their six teachers. Now, with 207 pupils, the school has no accommodation for 24 of its pupils and two teachers for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">One of the reasons Loughshinny managed to get its magnificent facility in 1989, which has unfortunately become outdated, was the very active and proud community in the village, which is very much a village between two large towns. This is reflected in a very active parents' association in the school. In light of the current difficulties, the parents' association has offered to pay for two prefabs to be placed on the school premises, but unfortunately, through some quirk of the administrative system, while the Department's permission was forthcoming, the permission of the school's patron, regrettably, was not. That is a matter for another day, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The current unusual and unfortunate situation is that the community is putting together the bones of a fundraising plan to realise between €20,000 and €22,500 to hire two prefab buildings for next September, while a resource room, which would more than adequately deal with the school's needs, can be built for €25,000. Even more unusually, this resource room was part and parcel of the original school plan in 1989. Its construction was deferred – this was prudent because the numbers did not justify it at the time – but now that we have the numbers as originally projected, we cannot get the building.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
          <p eId="para_1100">Your intervention is timely, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as I had just come to the vital point. I have no doubt the Minister has heard me. I thank her again for coming to the Chamber at this late hour to deal with this issue and I look forward to her response.</p>

        <speech by="#SiledeValera" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_654">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
          <p eId="para_1101">I thank Deputy Glennon for giving me the opportunity to outline on behalf of the Minister the Department's current position on the allocation of funding for temporary accommodation at primary schools. The Minister decided to publish the 2003 school building programme on the departmental website to give the maximum amount of information concerning the schools capital investment programme to managers, boards of management, principals, parents, students and all other interested parties. The criteria used for selecting projects were also published for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997, and includes funding for temporary accommodation. The 2003 programme will deliver more than 140 large scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, hundreds of schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme by means of funding for minor projects and temporary accommodation and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The extension to the original 1989 school building is not part of the 2003 school building programme and will be considered in the context of funding available for 2004 and subsequent years. The Deputy will appreciate that resources available to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for school building purposes are finite and applications received in the Department for capital building projects far exceed the funding available. Funding is allocated on a priority basis. St. Brendan's national school has applied to my Department for temporary accommodation. Funding for temporary classroom accommodation has been prioritised for schools which have no other accommodation available to them. St. Brendan's currently has available accommodation in the form of a general purpose room, which can be used for mainstream classroom purposes. Funding for temporary accommodation was therefore not sanctioned for this school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The Department's planning section keeps under review the situation with regard to providing additional educational accommodation in rapidly growing areas, including Fingal, and liaises with boards of management on individual school needs. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position on this matter to the House.</p>

        <heading>Post-Leaving Certificate Courses.</heading>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_655">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_1105">Is there a proposal to cap the number of students accessing post-leaving certificate courses in September 2003 at 2002 levels? If so, or if the Minister is even considering this, I earnestly ask that the position be reconsidered. Recently there was a great deal of debate and many newspaper headlines about the reintroduction of third level fees. The Minister for Education and Science indicated that he was concerned about access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds – indeed, he stated that the abolition of third level fees had not resulted in a significant improvement in that direction, and that is probably the case. The introduction of post-leaving certificate courses in recent years has for many students acted as both an alternative and a conduit to third level education. As a former teacher, I recognise the value of many of the courses introduced by the Department in the past ten to 15 years. I commend the energy, enthusiasm, commitment and hard work of teachers, boards of management and school management for implementing these courses. These range from transition year to leaving certificate vocational programmes, leaving certificate applied programmes and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">The leaving certificate applied programme, in particular, is a route for many students who do not wish to pursue an exclusively academic leaving certificate. It is finally a recognition by the Department that there are many different kinds of intelligences and that while memory and academic reasoning are of great value, they are just part of a much broader spectrum. Many students who pursue the leaving certificate applied programme will not be able to access third level education directly but they will be able to access post-leaving certificate courses. For some students such a course will act as an alternative to third level education but for others it will act as a conduit to third level. Many students who gain a pass leaving certificate will not be able to access third level directly but they will be able to access post-leaving certificate courses. That will allow students a much greater choice and greater access. Furthermore, many adults who want to access education will perhaps initially access a post-leaving certificate course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">There are broadly three groups here. There are those who pursue the leaving certificate applied programme, a significant percentage of whom will come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and those who wish to return to education and access third level, many of whom will not have been able to access third level through educational disadvantage. Finally, there are those who gain a pass leaving certificate course. For some that will be the best they can achieve and for others it will simply be because many students do not blossom until they are 18 years of age. I believe these three groups of people will be severely penalised if there is a cap on post-leaving certificate courses. If the Minister for Education and Science has any real concerns for those who suffer from educational disadvantage and wants to make a real difference to the lives of such students, perhaps he will consider spending some of his recent windfall from the Tánaiste if there is a problem with numbers in post-leaving certificate courses because these make such a huge difference to people who wish to access third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Many people speak of educational disadvantage but, as a former teacher, I know that certain measures work well and certain mechanisms will deliver. When one works in a school on a daily basis and sees something working well, which helps to ensure that those who suffer from disadvantage can access third level, one does not want to see that changed. I would like to see this remain as part of the system because post-leaving certificate courses help many from disadvantaged backgrounds to access third level. In my opinion, it would be crazy to change or curtail that. It would fly in the face of any effort to improve equity in access to third level. If there is a danger of capping the numbers who can access post-leaving certificate courses in 2003, I would ask the Minister to reassess the situation. If that is the avenue he intends to pursue, I would ask him to change his mind.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SiledeValera" eId="spk_656">
          <from>Miss de Valera</from>
          <p eId="para_1109">I thank Deputy Harkin for bringing this matter to our attention. I listened carefully to what she said and, as a former teacher, I understand and agree with a great deal of, if not all, the arguments put forward by the Deputy. As I am a former teacher, career guidance counsellor and psychologist, I realise these are the areas which are of importance, particularly to those who happen to be disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">The post-leaving certificate programme was introduced in 1985 with aid from the European Social Fund to provide integrated general education, vocational training and work experience for young people who had completed upper second level education or the equivalent. Its purpose was to enhance the prospects for these young people to gain employment. Since 1985, PLC courses have been developed in a wide range of disciplines supporting industry and community needs and have significantly widened the scope of educational provision. For example, during 2002-03, PLC courses were delivered in 225 centres around the country in both second level schools and stand-alone colleges, mainly in the VEC sector. The actual number of participants grew to over 28,000 from 12,000 in the 1989-90 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">The following table shows the pattern of actual enrolments in approved PLC courses over the past six years: 1997-98, 21,278; 1998-99, 23,810; 1999-2000, 24,453; 2000-01, 25,519; 2001-02, 26,722; and 2002-03, 28,656. In dealing with the question of PLC numbers, my Department is not always in a position to approve all the PLC places applied for in any particular academic year. For example, a total of 37,900 places were sought nationwide for 2002-03 from a planned pool of approximately 27,500 places. For the 2003-04 academic year, schools and colleges have sought approval for 40,733 places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">Looking forward, there will be a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers and manage expenditure, and provide for future investment and growth, as necessary, within the context of overall educational policy and provision. My Department has recently completed a review of the PLC sector. This review arose from a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and in the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life. Its purpose was to examine and make recommendations on the structures and resources required in schools and colleges with large-scale PLC provision, having regard to good practice in related areas across the system and in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">A steering group, representing the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Joint Managerial Body, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, the Teachers Union of Ireland, including representatives of the Department of Education and Science, was established to oversee the process. The consultancy study and the report and recommendations were prepared following an extensive research and consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The recommendations in the report are wide-ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision. The report proposes considerable challenges in relation to the shaping of structures for the delivery of further and adult education into the future. The recommendations will have to be considered fully at departmental level with a view to addressing the priority issues within the context of overall educational policy and provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">I assure the Deputy of my interest in and commitment to PLC courses. I agree with her that they have had a very positive impact on those who come from disadvantaged areas in particular. We want to see how best we can promote and progress that situation.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1116">A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat as deis a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a thógáil ar an Athló. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire atá sa Teach le freagra a thabhairt agus tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra maith le tabhairt aige.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Mar is eol don Aire, fógraíodh atá seachtain ó shin go bfhuil tionscal atá bunaithe ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dóbhair le blianta fada, tionscal nua-aoiseach a chuireann tairgí sláinte ar fáil, – BMR Teoranta – ag druidim na dóirse gan mhoill, go mbeidh 48 oibrithe ligthe chun bealaigh agus go mbeidh an monarcha dúnta go hiomlán. Seo tionscal a raibh cur amach mór agus 100 duine ag obair ann bliain ó shin agus anois beidh na dóirse druidte. Ar ndóigh, níl ansin ach comhartha den rud a tharla ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dóbhair le dhá bhliain nó trí bliana anuas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">An bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire nó an dtuigeann daoine go bhfuil beagnach 800 post caillte ar an eastát seo le trí bliana anuas? Sin figiúirí oifigiúla suas chun dáta, mar a fuaireamar seachtain ó shin iad ó Údarás na Gaeltachta. Is millteanach an buille é sin do aon cheantair ach is cinnte gur buille uafásach é do cheantair Gaeltachta a chlúdaíonn trí pharóistí. Nuair a bhímid ag caint ar eastát tionscail Ghaobth Dóbhair ní bhímid ag caint ar pharóiste Ghaoth ach ar thrí pharóistí, mar is eol don Teachta Ní Chochlain. Bímid ag caint ar Ghaoth Dóbhair, ar na Rossan agus ar Chloch Cheann Fhaola. Clúdaíonn sé an ceantar Gaeltachta sin ar fad agus is uafásach an rud é go bhfuil 800 post imithe ón eastát sin le trí bliana anuas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Ní híontas ar bith go bhfuil éadóchas agus ísle brí imeasc an phobail ar fad agus go bhfuil siad ag cur ceiste de shíor cad atá chun tarlú dóibh. Tá postanna á gcailleadh agus níl mórán postanna úra ag teacht isteach. Cad atá in ann dóibh ach an bád bán, mar a deirtear i gConamara agus mar a deir an t-Aire féin. Tá súil agam nach dtig sé go dtí an pointe sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Cad iad na tionscail atá dúnta. Na blianta ó shin ba í an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dóbhair an eastát tionscail a ba thábhachtaí ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí sé mar sheod i gcoróin an údaráis. Bhí beagnach 1,400 duine ag obair ansin ach tá thart faoina leath de sin ag obair ansin anois. Cuimhním ar na monarchana sin. Beidh BMR, a bhfuilimid ag caint faoi anocht, dúnta gan mhoill. Tá Dianorm, a raibh breis agus 100 duine ag obair ann, dúnta agus faoi ghlas, tá RMT dúnta agus faoi ghlas, tá EPI dúnta agus faoi ghlas, tá PLM dúnta agus faoi ghlas agus tá SMTC, a raibh 200 duine ag obair ann, dúnta agus faoi ghlas. Sin cuid des na monarchana. Nuair a shiúilimse timpeall an eastaít san oíche agus nuair a fheicim an áit go léir dorcha cuirim ceist orm féin, cad atá ag tarlú don cheantair Gaeltachta seo?</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Tá an géarchéim chomh mór sin gur ullmhaigh an t-údarás plean ghníomhaíochta. Bhí an t-Aire é féin, an Teachta Ní Chochlain agus roinnt Airí eile ansin i mí na Nollag seo caite nuair a cuireadh an plean i láthair an phobail ach is beag a tharla ó shin. An t-aon rud a tharla ná gur dúnadh tuilleadh monarchana.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Tá mé i mo sheasamh anseo anocht gan cruthú ar bith nach mbeidh mé anseo gan mhoill arís ag caoineadh arís go bhfuil monarcha eile ag druidim. Cad mar gheall ar na tionscail atá ar sheachtain trí lá? Tá monarcha snáth Comer ag obair trí lá gach re-sheachtain agus dúnta gach seachtain eile. Tá beagnach 200 duine ag obair ann. Cad atá in ann don tionscail seo? Tá súil agam nach mbeimid ag cailleadh 200 phost eile. Dá gcaillfí iad is cinnte gur buille marfach a bhéas ann don eastát i nGaoth Dóbhair. Cloiseadh tráthnóna inniu go bhfuil Nuvotem, i gCroithlí, a bhfuil 70 duine ag obair ann ag dul ar sheachtain trí lá an tseachtain seo chugainn. Cad é atá ag dul a tharla dos na tuismitheoirí atá ag obair ansin agus nach mbeidh aon fhostaíocht acu?</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an t-Aire anseo agus go bhfuil mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ní Chochlain, anseo fosta. Tá suim mhór aici san eastát agus eolas maith aici air agus tuigeann sí go maith cad atá ar siúl agamsa anseo anocht. Cad é atáimid ag dul a dhéanamh le fostaíocht a thabhairt ar ais go dtí an eastát sin. Níl aon rud eile ann. Níl aon talmhaíocht nó iascaireacht ní turasóireacht i nGaoth Dóbhair. Cad atá in ann don phobal?</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Iarraim ar an Aire gach tacaíocht a thabhairt do Údarás na Gaeltachta an plean gníomhaíochta sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus tionscail úra a thabhairt isteach. Tá an Ghaeltacht faoi bhrú agus is cinnte go bhfuil an teanga faoi bhrú.</p>

          <p eId="para_1125">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta McGinley as ucht na ceiste seo a thógáil. Tá mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí Ní Chochlain agus Ó Gallchobhair tar éis labhairt liom faoin gceist seo freisin. Go deimhin, bhí mé thíos san taobh sin tíre Dé Sathairn seo caite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">Is cómhlacht é BMR Teoranta a bhfuil aonad tairgíochta aige ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dóbhair i gContae Dhún na nGall agus aonad riaracháin eile ar eastát na Páirce Móire i nGaeltacht na hAchréidh i nGaillimh. D'fhógair an cómhlacht ar an 5 Meitheamh 2003 go bhfuil sé le 48 fostaí i nGaoth Dóbhair a scaoileadh chun bealaigh ar an 7 lúil 2003 agus go ndúnfar an mhonarcha ansin. Tá sé i gceist ag an gcómhlacht cúraimí áirithe, mar shampla, orduithe custaimeirí, a athrú go Gaillimh agus tabharfar deis do chuid de na fostaithe athrú go dtí an t-aonad sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">Ba mhaith liom a threisiú gur cúis imní dom féin agus do Údaras na Gaeltachta aon phostanna a bheith a gcailliúint in aon tionscal Gaeltachta, agus go hairithe i nGaoth Dobhair, áit atá buailte go dona le cupla bliain anuas, mar adúirt an Teachta. Tuigim go maith an t-imní atá ar an Teachta agus ar gach éinne faoin líon postanna atá caillte sa cheantar. Caithfear a chur san áireamh go bhfuil lagú an-mhór tarlaithe san earnáil deantúsaíochta le tamall anuas mar gheall ar chuinsí náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta. Ar an drochuair tá drochthioncar aige seo ar leibhéal na fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Tá sé aitheanta ag Údaras na Gaeltachta go bhfuil gá le cur chuige nuálach straitéiseach chun cruthú agus caomhnú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a threisiú, mar aisfhreagra ar na hathruithe atá ag tarlú san eacnamaíocht dhomhanda agus náisiúnta. Caithfear dul i ngleic le dushláin nua maidir le riachtanais, roghanna agus mianta fostaíochta phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá an cur chuige seo sonraithe sna ráitis chinnbhliana agus sna tuarascálacha bliantúla le tamall anuas, agus go deimhin sna gníomhartha praiticiúla atá tógtha ag an údaras, le tacaíocht mo Roinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na céimeanna is déanaí atá tógtha chun borradh a chur faoi chursaí fostaíochta i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall. Luaim ach go háirithe, an grúpa oibre ar chruthú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a bhunaigh mo chomhleacaí an t-Aire Máire Ní Chochlain anuraidh. Ag eascairt ón tuarascáil a chuir an grúpa sin ar fáil i mí na Nollag 2002, tá luas a chur leis na hiarrachtaí le fostaíocht nua-aimseartha bhuan a chur ar fáil. Tá raon na dtionscal a ndíreofar orthu á leathnú agus tá béim faoi leith á cur ar fheabhsú bonneagair, ar chomhoibriú le hinstitiuidí trí leibhéal, agus ar dheiseanna i bhfiontair bunaithe ar theanga agus chultúr na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Mar atá raite agam go minic, is í an Ghaeilge an acmhainn is luachmhaire atá sa Ghaeltacht agus, go deimhin fein, beidh forbairt na Gaeltachta san am amach romhainn ag brath cuid mhór ar an nGaeilge bheith slán mar theanga labhartha inti. Is chuige sin gur shocraigh mé i gcomhar leis an údarás go mbeadh 20% dá bhuiséad caipitil a chur i dtreo tograí agus tionscadail go bhfuil sé follasach go bhfuil an Ghaeilge lárnach dá gcuid gníomhaíochtaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Sa chomhthéacs céanna, is fiú trácht a dheanamh ar an sceim nua fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a láinseáil an t-údaras an tseachtain sea caite. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlachadh leis an Teachta as ucht fáilte a chur roimhe sin. De réir na scéime nua seo beidh deontas suas le €10,000 in aghaidh an phoist ar fail i leith gach post nua a chruthaítear sa réimse seo agus €5,000 i leith gach post pairtaimseartha. Má bhíonn ardleibhéal scile nó cumais riachtanach don phost is feidir go mbeadh suas le €2,500 eile in aghaidh an phoist ar fáil mar thacaíocht. Anuas air seo beidh deontais fhlaithiúla le haghaidh staidéar féidearthachta nó taighde agus forbartha ar fáil mar chunamh do fhiontraithe pé réamhobair, taighde nó anailís is gá dhéanamh lena bpleananna gnó a chur i dtoll a chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">Tá na moltaí eile i dtuarascáil an ghrupa oibre ar chruthú fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a scrúdú ag mo Roinn faoi láthair, i gcomhair Ie hÚdaras na Gaeltachta, chun féachaint cén chaoi is fearr iad a chur i gcrích. Mar shampla, pléadh na moltaí éagsúla i dtaobh forbairt fiontair agus cruthú fostaíochta ag cruinniú le gairid idir oifigigh on Roinn Fiontar, Trádála agus Fostaíochta agus a cuid aisínteachtaí, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus mo Roinn fein. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí plé ag mo Roinn leis an Roinn Ealaíon, Spóirt agus Tuarasóireachta maidir leis an bpoiteinseal atá ag tionscal na turasóireachta, go háirithe an turasóireacht chultúrtha, chun deiseanna fostaíochta inmharthanacha a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_661">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1138">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this important item tonight. On behalf of the Labour Party, Deputy O'Sullivan and I want to highlight this important issue. We have brought it to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science on a number of occasions and we also want to highlight it on behalf of the many people who have contacted us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">There is great anger directed at what is effectively a cutback in the back to education allowance, which had been highly successful. Many people feel it is an attack on a vulnerable sector which has fallen prey to Government spending cutbacks. I know the Minister has probably stood in the breach to ensure that the wild swinging axe of swingeing cutbacks that would be perpetrated by that great right-wing axis of the Ministers, Deputies McCreevy and Harney, who epitomise the "Reaganomics" view of politics in this country and who practise it with great zeal. They would undoubtedly have done even more damage if the Minister had not stood in the breach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">I am, however, disappointed. A groundswell of anger is directed against this cutback, which is rightly perceived as an assiduous attack on the vulnerable. For many people, the back to education allowance represents an opportunity to halt a cycle of unemployment in which they might have been for a period of time. It opened up educational opportunities and offered a chance to get back to productive work. The Minister has now changed the winning formula. When something is not broken it does not need to be fixed, and there is no need for tinkering at the edges. This is another unfortunate implementation of a cutback by stealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">I have already referred to the Minister the case of a person whose plans were torpedoed in mid-stream. This person had a legitimate expectation of an ongoing funding stream over the 12-month cycle. This has now been cut back to nine months, with the payment for the three-month summer period gone. The holiday period payment has been curtailed and there are no longer allowances to cover post-graduate courses except those which lead to an educational qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">I thank the Minister for considering the position of people studying for the higher diploma in education and similar courses. That was an important concession that was wrung from her. There are, however, technical problems arising daily as a result of this cutback, problems the Minister did not countenance when this cutback was introduced. Representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland were very unhappy the Minister failed to meet them or consult them or give them some view of the thinking in this regard. They felt it was a rushed measure. The scheme was originally designed to help the long-term unemployed, those on widow's pensions or disability allowances, to break out of the poverty trap. That is the essential area on which the Labour Party is focusing. That is why its anger is echoed here tonight by Deputy O'Sullivan in the education area and by myself as the party spokesman on social and family affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">Cutting back on the back to education allowance brings huge negative effects in return for a very small saving. This was a very successful Government initiative on education. This matter must be reviewed and we strongly urge the Minister to do so. There are only about 6,800 people who qualify for the scheme. What will be saved other than a few euro here and there? If some of the tax shelters of which we have heard were to be closed off – there are 33 in operation – the money brought in could go to the Minister's Department. I know she would spend it wisely and make sure that the back to education scheme would apply to all the people currently locked out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_662">
          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1144">I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time with me. I am concerned, as he is, that the people who will be affected by the changes to this scheme are people who did not have the opportunity to benefit from the educational system when they were younger. In many cases they would have left school in their early teens. They would have seen the scheme as an opportunity to return to study, and they have genuinely benefited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">As Deputy Penrose said, this was a very good and effective scheme. Because some of the people in the scheme will no longer be paid during the summer holidays and will not be able to avail of the opportunity to do post-graduate work, the cutbacks are directly affecting people who have made plans. In many cases, people would be doing voluntary work during the summer as an adjunct to their courses. I know of particular cases where people are going to developing countries or working in their own communities on a voluntary basis during the summer. They would have expected to have the back to education allowance scheme available to them. As the Minister is aware, if these people sign on the unemployment register, they must be available for work and actively seeking work. Accordingly, it will not be practicable for them. Only a very small amount of money will be saved by the cutbacks, yet they are creating a genuine deterrent for many people who did not have certain educational opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">I thank the Minister for attending the House to take the question. We are all anxious to give people this second opportunity. There are many people of our ages – I am not too sure how old the Minister is – who did not have that opportunity. They might have it now, if they were in the education system, but certainly they did not have it when we were going to school. The scheme has offered these people an opportunity to get right through the education system. It is a shame that the scheme has been cut back in this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1147">Ar dtús báire gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe as an cheist seo a cur os mo chomhair anocht.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">My Department administers a range of back to education programmes under the umbrella of its employment support services to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to return to work through the acquisition and improvement of skills and academic qualifications which will enable them to compete more successfully for employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The aim of the BTEA scheme is to assist people who are unable to access the labour market because of lack of qualifications or education and who are caught up in a cycle of unemployment and disadvantage. For example, the scheme has given many people who left school early a second chance for education which will improve their prospects of getting employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Following a review of my Department's back to education provisions and in light of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, it was decided that the scheme should be refocused towards people who most need additional training or qualifications to gain a foothold in the labour market. In the past, the back to education allowance scheme provided for payment to be made to persons during the summer period between academic years. However, people who had been previously unemployed often find work opportunities either at home or abroad during the summer months. In such circumstances and to ensure that resources focus on the most vulnerable in our community, it was decided that it was inappropriate to continue to pay BTEA for this period. Of course, participants in the scheme who fail to find employment during the summer may be entitled to an unemployment payment, subject to satisfying the usual qualifications. Participants on the BTEA scheme who have to, as an integral part of their course, undergo a period of work placement, work experience or research during the summer months will continue to receive the allowance for this period. I know that the chairman of the committee raised specific issues in this area and I will get back to him on the voluntary aspect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The decision affects only BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the scheme. Participants who accessed the scheme by way of a disability or lone parent payment are not affected and will continue to receive the allowance during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">I should also add that BTEA participants who intend returning to the next year of their course or progressing in qualifications will have their BTEA reinstated from the beginning of the new academic year, irrespective of whether they were employed or in receipt of an unemployment payment during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Regarding changes in the scheme as it relates to postgraduates, I am satisfied that those in possession of a third level qualification have, generally speaking, already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which will impact positively on their employment prospects. However, the BTEA will continue to apply to postgraduate courses such as the higher diploma, H. Dip., which add significantly to a person's employability. My Department will therefore continue to support those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">In a time of financial constraint, I want to ensure that supports are directed to those with more pressing needs. I am satisfied that the new arrangements will ensure that the back to education scheme continues to provide support to those people who are most distant from the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">With regard to the Union of Students in Ireland, their representative took the opportunity of coming in to enjoy themselves at the front door of my Department some time ago. I asked them to forward a submission to me, which I have not yet received. My officials met them and discussed the issue with them. I look forward to seeing their presentation in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_1162">The affordable housing initiative forms part of the housing and accommodation special initiative under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. The parties to the pay agreement proposed the new initiative with the objective of increasing the supply of affordable housing by 10,000 units. In response to this proposal, the Government committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing coming through this initiative and arrangements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_58">As provided for in the agreement, we are working with the parties to the pay agreement to develop all aspects of the new initiative. This includes issues such as defining the eligibility criteria to apply to the target group, the appropriate models for delivery and financing arrangements and the question of land acquisition. In this regard, the feasibility of releasing some State lands for use under the initiative, and the possible terms under which this might be done, are also being examined.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">On the broader question of the costs of land for housing, the Taoiseach has asked the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land, including revisiting the recommendations of the Kenny report. In doing this, the committee will have to consider the constitutional and practical issues involved. The Government will give due consideration to any recommendations made by the committee, including any recommendations for change to the Constitution.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">Discussions on the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative will continue with the relevant social partners to ensure that the necessary actions are taken before the end of the agreement to secure achievement of this objective, with measurable progress to be made by the mid-term review in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">It is a key principle underpinning the development of this initiative, that it should not impact on the Exchequer or general Government finances and the examination at this stage is necessarily concerned with identifying appropriate mechanisms to ensure this. Furthermore, it is intended that the initiative will not detract from the funding available for existing social and affordable housing programs, nor should it impact on the continuing efforts to maintain overall housing supply.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">I welcome this initiative as another means of bringing more affordable housing on stream. We must work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised and to continue measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1164">My Department has not to date issued any specific planning guidelines in relation to high-rise development. However, the guidelines for planning authorities on residential density, published by my Department in September 1999, deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with issues relating to building height.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_63">The residential density guidelines indicate that while it is a common perception that higher densities require taller buildings, it is possible to increase density significantly with modest increases in height. The guidelines state that in general, low rise buildings which respect the scale and character of Irish towns and cities are appropriate. However the guidelines recognise that taller buildings may be appropriate in specific circumstances, namely, in locations specifically identified in development plans as being appropriate for higher buildings, such as locations close to an expanse of water or public parkland where a building of greater scale may be more appropriate or in a central district, town or city centre location where an increase in massing and height in the form of a contemporary and stylish building, could make a positive contribution to the skyline.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">Dublin City Council published a report "Managing Intensification and Change – A Strategy for Dublin Building Height" in September 2000. The strategy recognised the intrinsic quality of Dublin as a low to medium rise city, predominantly below 30 metres high, but indicated that areas such as Heuston or the Docklands with large under-utilised sites are development character areas with opportunity for considerable development. In such areas, there is potential for higher buildings without compromising the local context.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">The guidelines for planning authorities on residential density are construed as being Ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must, therefore, have regard to those guidelines in the exercise of their planning functions. I have no plans at this time to revise the residential density guidelines.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1173">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated his intention to undertake a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act 1997. Since its enactment, the 1997 Act has been amended on a number of occasions. In addition, the Act's provisions have now been used at all elections covered by the Act, including the general election in May 2002. It is, therefore, opportune to review its provisions following experience gained at the various elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">The Minister has asked the Standards in Public Office Commission for a report on the commission's views on the operation of the Act's provisions, particularly in relation to the 2002 general election. Regard will also be had to the contents of the commission's report on election expenditure at the 2002 general election which was published last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">It is envisaged that the review will be completed within as short a timescale as possible. However, the Minister also considers that a broadly based consultation on this matter involving <i>inter alia </i>the political parties, is desirable and it is intended to allow time also for this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1177">In December 1999 the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association, ICDA, entered into a voluntary agreement with my predecessor for the effective phasing-out by end 2002 of the marketing of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergent products by ICDA members. ICDA represents some 90% of the domestic laundry detergents market in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">The agreement provides for a phased move to zero-phosphate products by ICDA members as follows: by 30 June 2000, 55% of market share to be zero-phosphate, by 31 December 2001, 90% of market share to be zero-phosphate, and by 31 December 2002, 95% of market share to be zero phosphate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">My Department is satisfied with the progress that has been achieved to date for compliance with the interim targets, and I understand that ICDA was on track in 2002 to deliver the final phase of the agreement. The submission to my Department of ICDA's audited sales figures for 2002 is due at end June 2003 and will provide additional information as to sales trends at end 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">In a related initiative, my Department is in continuing liaison with the non-ICDA sector, and significant progress is being achieved towards securing a similar phase-out by that sector of the marketing of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents.</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">The report of the European Commission on the quality of bathing water for the 2002 bathing season, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, confirms that Irish bathing waters are amongst the best in Europe in terms of water quality. This report indicates that Ireland has, as in 2001, excellent bathing water quality, with 97.7% of the combined total sea water and fresh water bathing areas complying with the mandatory standards laid down in the bathing water directive.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_73">Monitoring of bathing water quality is undertaken in accordance with national regulations implementing the European Council directive on quality of bathing waters 76/160/EEC. The annual report on the quality of bathing water in Ireland is prepared by the EPA using the results of monitoring undertaken by local authorities. Where bathing waters do not comply with the specified standards, local authorities are required to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the standards prescribed in relation to designated bathing waters by the Quality of Bathing Waters Regulations 1992.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">My Department is promoting major investment by local authorities nationwide to upgrade sewerage networks and waste water treatment facilities. The main impact of this investment will be on estuarine and coastal areas. The current water services investment programme, which covers the years 2002-04, relates to 380 wastewater schemes with an estimated capital value of €2.6 billion, including all of the remaining schemes needed for full compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive which requires specific wastewater treatment and or collection facilities to be in place by 31 December 2005 for discharges for a graduated range of agglomerations thresholds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">By the end of 2003 Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, and many other smaller urbans, will have state-of-the-art waste water treatment facilities in place and operational. Major schemes are well advanced in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Wexford. Other major coastal schemes under construction, or due to start this year, include the Carrigaline, Cobh, Dungarvan, Sligo, Tramore and Waterford main drainage schemes. Schemes for Bray, Bundoran, New Ross and Shanganagh are approved for funding to commence in 2004, together with the Arklow main drainage scheme, subject to the outcome of current legal proceedings relating to the proposed location of the treatment plant in the latter case. This major programme of investment in coastal areas will have a significant positive effect on the quality of bathing water in the surrounding areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">The Ringsend waste water treatment plant, the largest such project hitherto constructed in Ireland, which is currently being commissioned, will deal with the waste water treatment requirements of all of Dublin City and south Dublin, significant areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and parts of County Meath. This scheme, which includes nutrient removal or tertiary treatment, will serve a population equivalent of 1.6 million and will produce the single biggest ever improvement in the quality of Irish coastal waters and in time restore bathing water standards throughout Dublin Bay.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1194">I am aware of the views of the Dublin Simon Community in the matter and, while I share the concern at the level of homelessness, I must also emphasise the Governments continuing commitment to tackling the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">According to the assessment of homelessness undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, the number of homeless households at 3,773 showed a slight increase over the 1999 figure of 3,743. This situation clearly challenges all public authorities concerned to intensify their efforts. Equally, however, there is evidence of good progress in tackling the underlying causes of homelessness and in making preventative strategies more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Virtually all of the three year action plans to tackle homelessness required by Homelessness – An Integrated Strategy have been completed by local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, and work is well under way on implementing the measures in them. A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into accommodation that is more suitable to their needs has already been provided and more will be provided in future years as part of the full implementation of the action plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the rollout of the accommodation element of the Homeless Strategies. Capital funding from my Department for the direct provision by local authorities of specific accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million over the period 2001-05. The voluntary and co-operative sector is also playing an active part through the provision of housing for homeless persons under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme and 500 such dwellings have been provided in the past two years alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">Recoupment by my Department of current expenditure on accommodation-related homeless services by local authorities has increased significantly from €12.6 million in 1999 to an expected €50 million this year. These increases are clear evidence of the Government's determination to provide the funding necessary to address the issue of homelessness in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The prevention of homelessness is also being addressed. The main aim of the homeless preventative strategy is to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care without the appropriate measures in place to ensure that they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed and its provisions are now being implemented.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_77">I am also concerned to ensure that the care and welfare needs of homeless people are also adequately addressed. In this context the implementation of both the integrated and preventative strategies will continue to be monitored by the cross Department team on homelessness with a view to identifying and addressing any obstacles to progress.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_79">Local authorities were advised, in the policy statement, Changing our Ways, which was published in 1998, that achievement of national waste objectives requires,inter alia, a major reduction in reliance on landfill and the adoption of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. Authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix waste of waste treatment facilities which, at a regional level, would maximise recovery of materials or energy and minimise environmental emissions at reasonable cost. Against this background, regional waste management plans were adopted which provide, inter alia, for waste minimisation, materials recycling, biological treatment of organic wastes, thermal treatment with energy recovery and landfill of residual wastes that cannot otherwise be recovered.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, published in March 2002, complements the implementation of these plans. Its basic premise is that only waste material that cannot be prevented, re-used, recycled or otherwise treated should be landfilled. Accordingly, it outlines a range of measures to be undertaken in the interests of minimising waste generation and ensuring a sustained expansion in re-use and recycling performance. My Department's priorities on waste management are now heavily focused on implementation, that is, to ensure that the waste management plans are fully and speedily implemented; waste prevention efforts are intensified through a well resourced national waste prevention programme; our recycling efforts are significantly expanded; and producer responsibly initiatives are extended; with the overall objective of significantly reducing the volumes of waste going to landfill.</summary>

In relation to strengthening the structures, we have developed a wide range of administrative arrangements and new initiatives, including the setting up of set up a cross departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships and another on social inclusion; the creation of a Cabinet committee on housing infrastructure and public private partnerships and on social inclusion, each chaired by the Taoiseach; the publication of the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 and the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the enactment of the Bill; new organisational structures within my Department with enhanced focus on housing supply, voluntary housing, affordable housing and social inclusion; additional resourcing and continued support for the enhanced role of the housing unit, particularly in the area of research.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">In addition, as part of the implementation of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, arrangements are being made to reconstitute the national housing forum, as established under the PPF, to provide the social partners with an opportunity to contribute to housing policy development by my Department. This approach has delivered consistently higher levels of overall housing output and a major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. 2002 was the eighth consecutive year of record housing output when 57,695 units were completed, an increase of 9.7% on 2001. In addition, we expect to provide more than 12,000 units of social and affordable housing in 2003 compared to just short of 8,700 units in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">At the most recent meeting of the national housing forum, considerable reservations were expressed by the forum about the concept of an executive national housing authority. The consensus, which I broadly support, was that the establishment of a national housing authority would be of questionable wisdom, particularly as housing is essentially a local issue, best delivered locally. With the development of housing strategies now forming an important component of local authorities' planning and development functions, local authorities are now placed to deliver on overall housing objectives and to deliver social and affordable housing objectives in partnership with the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. Nonetheless, it is recognised that further progress in the housing sector could be better achieved by improving capacity for housing research; dissemination of best housing management practice, etc. in local authorities; support for the voluntary housing sector; and synergies between existing housing agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1224">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 126 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission of a pollutant into the atmosphere from such premises. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act empowers a local authority to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The Air Pollution Act 1987 (Air Quality Standards) Regulations 1987 specify current standards for, <i>inter alia,</i> suspended particulates, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 specify new and more stringent standards for these and other pollutants to apply from 2005 to 2010. National policy for achieving air quality standards and emissions reductions is informed by the available air quality measurement data and interaction with the EPA and local authorities as appropriate. Air quality assessment is a matter for the agency and air quality management a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_81">The Waste Management Act 1996 also places a general duty on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity. In addition, section 20(5) of the Fire Services Act 1981 provides that a fire authority may serve a fire safety notice on the owner or occupier of land on which a flammable, explosive or potentially explosive substance is used, stored or deposited adjacent to buildings in such a manner as to represent a serious danger to life. The fire safety notice may require that specified measures be taken to reduce the level of danger. Under Part VII of the Local Government Act 1994, it is open to a local authority to make by-laws in the interests of the common good of the local community that any activity should be regulated or controlled.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">As regards other measures designed to reduce emissions of smoke and sulphur dioxide from domestic fires, my Department and the solid fuel trade group, representing the principal importers and distributors of solid fuel in Ireland, signed a voluntary agreement on 5 June 2002 which provides for significantly more stringent sulphur limits in bituminous coal and petcoke. As part of this agreement I made the Air Pollution Act 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 extending the ban on bituminous coal to an additional four urban areas – Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee. That brings to 16 in total the number of such areas nationally. A copy of the agreement is available in the Oireachtas Library.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">In this overall context, there are no specific plans to put in place additional measures regulating garden or domestic fires at this time. However, my Department is studying the findings of the recent EPA report on dioxins to pursue,inter alia, a progressive reduction in dioxin emissions where those are achievable in practice.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1233">I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 114 and 123 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. Indeed, the impact of Ireland's recent rapid and sustained economic growth and the effect of this on the housing sector, particularly in Dublin, follows a pattern seen in other countries. The substantial increases in housing supply achieved in recent years have been of critical importance in improving affordability and moderating house price increases. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to 8-11% in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">Measures to boost supply such as the Government's investment in infrastructure and the increased residential densities now being achieved as a result of the residential guidelines produced by my Department have been successful in addressing the strong demand for housing. Last year, 2002, was the eighth successive year of record house completions, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001, and a more than 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe – close to 15 units per 1,000 population last year which is a significant achievement. Recent indicators suggest that this upward trend in housing supply is continuing into this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_84">Improved supply of housing is a key component in moderating house prices and improving affordability. Other aspects such as high levels of economic growth, which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable incomes, increased employment; lower interest rates; low inflation have also improved the affordability of housing. The Government remains committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases and also to assisting low income groups and those with social housing needs by means of the range of targeted social and affordable housing programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">Activity is increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, which assist households unable to purchase in the private market to own their own houses. A total of 882 affordable housing units were built in 2002, approximately three times the output in 2001, and 1,686 households benefited under the shared ownership scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Total capital funding for housing of €1.7 billion is being provided this year, a near 7% increase on the amount provided in 2002, which should enable the housing needs of more than 12,000 households to be met this year. The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing and the housing initiative included in the new national partnership agreement Sustaining Progress also seeks to boost the supply of affordable housing. In conjunction with the existing affordable housing and shared ownership schemes these instruments will become increasingly important in providing greater access to home ownership by lower income groups in the medium term. The Government is committed to ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner and will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary.</summary>

My Department compiles, on an annual basis in arrears, statistical information in relation to rental income and finalisation of data for the year ending 31 December 2002 is currently being pursued with local authorities. The amount of arrears outstanding at the end of 2001 has accumulated over a period of years. However, local authorities are now operating more efficient and effective rent collection and arrears prevention and recovery regimes by adherence to best practice guidelines issued by the housing unit in 2001 and the increased use of information technology. This has resulted in maximising the collection of amounts due. In addition, local authorities measure their performance in this area by reference to a set of agreed performance indicators and publish the results in their annual reports.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1242">The results of the assessment of homelessness undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, as part of the overall assessment of housing needs, are included in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's 2002 Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, which was published recently. The time lag between carrying out the assessment and publishing the results was due to the need to compile the results and verify their accuracy. In addition, concerns were raised about the validity of the figures for the Dublin area which needed to be further examined before the overall results could be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">In some instances, there are differences between the number of homeless people recorded in the assessment and the level of homelessness indicated in the local homeless action plans. The assessment is an indication of the level of homelessness on a specific date while many action plans refer to the number of people who presented as homelessness over a period of time such as a year in order to get an overview of the flows into homelessness over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">The need to improve data on homelessness is recognised. In Dublin, the Homeless Agency, with the support of the Department, is currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers, including the voluntary sector. This system tracks each individual person presenting as homeless to any of these services and this will allow a profile of people using homeless services, and their needs, to be built up. It is intended that the system will be extended to all homeless services in the Dublin area. Similar improvements in data collection and analysis on homelessness are being considered in other local authority areas where there are a significant number of homeless persons. The issue of improved data collection generally is also being addressed as part of the development of an integrated IT package for housing for all local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">Substantial progress has been made in addressing the needs of people sleeping rough. In Dublin, additional outreach teams have been established to make contact with people sleeping rough and assist them into accommodation. Dublin City Council has a nightly bus service which takes people from the streets to available accommodation. A hostel for young drug users opened in late 2001 and a wet shelter for street drinkers opened in late 2002. A long-term supported housing project for street drinkers is due to open in Dublin later this year. In addition, a wet hostel has also opened in Limerick City.</p>

          <p eId="para_1263">I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 160 and 178 of 14 May 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">The ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, is the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, to be achieved within a timeframe sufficient, <i>inter alia,</i> to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. Thus, under the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC all countries, including Ireland, negotiated a real, meaningful and challenging target that require going beyond business-as-usual. Given the complexity of the task, the timeframe involved is 15 years, of which some five years have now elapsed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Ireland has a Kyoto emissions growth limitation target of 13% over 1990 levels within the overall EU Kyoto reduction target of 8%, reflecting our contribution to the overall EU commitment and our need for economic development. Our emissions of greenhouse gases were always expected to increase in the medium term, and we have ensured this was at a considerably slower rate than our unprecedented economic growth since the 1990s. Ireland is the most successful member state after Luxembourg in achieving a decoupling of emissions from economic growth since 1990. Emissions per unit of GDP are now 62% of what they were in 1990 compared to 78% for the EU as a whole.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">Ireland, however, has now the highest levels of emissions growth within the EU, reaching 31% in 2001 over 1990 levels. The European Environment Agency has identified us as among ten of 15 member states significantly challenged in relation to achieving their agreed share of the EUs Kyoto target. The substantial reductions achieved by some member states followed significant and abrupt structural changes occurring for other reasons. Recent data indicate some erosion of reduction gains beginning to occur as emissions for the EU as a whole rose in 2001.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">Our Kyoto obligations arise in the commitment period 2008-12. The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, comprises a systematic programme towards meeting these obligations, and sets a ten year policy framework for achieving the necessary emissions reductions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">A progress report on the implementation of the strategy was published in May 2002. While this shows that measures in place or in progress are capable of achieving approximately 20% of the reductions required to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations, continuing emissions increases due to volume growth in the economy mean that implementation of the strategy must be intensified. In essence, there has been progress in decoupling emissions growth from economic development, but the task now is to intensify this decoupling.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">Meeting our target is an important Government commitment, and a review of the implementation of the strategy has been initiated to ensure more focused and intensive implementation. I intend to publish the outcome of this review later in the year. My Department is satisfied that full implementation over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008-12 period, and any penalties are avoided.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">The EPA environmental research programme under the national development plan includes a major report on scenarios and impacts of climate change in Ireland, and I expect this to be published shortly. This will provide a basis for the agencies responsible for long-term planning, and where adaptation to climate change is relevant, to factor in the inevitable changes with greater confidence. Meeting our Kyoto target will be an important contribution to global efforts to tackle climate change, and I am satisfied that it can only be through long-term sustained reductions globally that the expected effects of climate change in Ireland can be ameliorated.</summary>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_695">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_1266">Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with local sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the EPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The figures in relation to compliance with the faecal coliforms standard used in the European Environment Agency report are from 1995. Since then there have been improvements in the compliance of Irish drinking water supplies with the standard. It is emphatically not the case that Ireland's drinking water is among the most contaminated in Europe. The European Environment Agency report does not contain data which enables comparisons to be made between Ireland and other European countries. In relation to Ireland the report includes data for all sampled drinking water supplies. This covers small and large public supplies, private group water schemes and individual private wells. In relation to other countries the report contains data in relation to public supplies only and, in many cases, only to large public supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Ireland is exceptional in terms of full, open and transparent reporting on the quality of its drinking water. The EPA publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, and a copy of the report for 2001 is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report is based on the results of some 146,000 individual tests on over 22,000 samples of drinking water taken from 2,440 supplies. The report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water with an overall compliance rate of 94.3% with prescribed standards for all supplies, based on 14 principal parameters. It also indicates improvements in the compliance rate for the faecal coliforms parameter which, in public supplies, was up from 96.7% to 97.2% and, in group schemes, was up from 70.8% to 74.1%. Following on from recommendations made in previous years, documented procedures are in place or in preparation by a number of authorities to respond to detected breaches of quality standards. Future reports will highlight the extent to which deficiencies identified in EPA audits have been addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_94">Ongoing investment by my Department in the development and upgrading of water supply infrastructure is intended to maximise compliance with prescribed quality standards. The National Development Plan 2000–2006 provides for investment amounting to some €1.3 billion on major water supply schemes, and the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-04 includes 218 public water supply schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">Water quality deficiencies in group water schemes are mainly confined to those schemes which are dependent on private sources, including rivers, lakes and boreholes. The schemes involved serve some 50,000 rural households. Since March 2000, all of these schemes are eligible for a 100% grant for the installation of water disinfection and treatment equipment. To ensure the most cost effective delivery and operation of such equipment, and secure the long-term protection of the related capital investment, procurement policy in the group sector is, in common with small public schemes, based on design, build, operate contracts, coupled with the grouping of numbers of schemes under a single contract. My Department recently produced a comprehensive procurement guidance document to assist local authorities and group schemes in the implementation of this policy. The EPA report acknowledges and welcomes the extensive Government response to problems in this sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">In February of this year, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced details of a record €100 million in funding to be spent this year on a systematic programme to address quality problems affecting rural water supplies. An allocation of €78 million is being made to county councils by way of block grants. The balance of €22 million will be spent on measures such as the single house well grant, €5 million approximately, subsidies towards the operational cost of group water schemes, €7 million approximately, piloting of new wastewater treatment systems for small rural villages, €4 million, strategic rural water planning, €1 million, county council administration costs, €4 million, monitoring of rural water quality, €750,000, and grants to the national federation of group water schemes, €506,000. This is almost a 50% increase in capital spending planned for 2003 by comparison to last year, and a tenfold increase since 1996.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">A comprehensive group water scheme monitoring programme commenced in October 2002. Under this programme drinking water in the estimated 1,500 group schemes coming within the remit of the new drinking water regulations will be sampled and analysed. I have also appointed consultants to assist in the establishment of a drinking water national monitoring programme. This will put in place a comprehensive, harmonised and uniform system of sampling, testing and reporting to assist compliance with the new regulations.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1270">The national development plan provides for investment of approximately €17.5 billion for measures coming within the remit of my Department, including social housing, water and waste water services, non-national roads, waste management, urban and village development, habitat protection and conservation, and heritage conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">Progress on the housing, water services and non-national roads measures has been satisfactory. In 2002, expenditure exceeded the NDP allocation under all three measures and in housing there was the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for 16 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">While the number of water services schemes to be completed was down on projections, this is due, in part, to the focus on large infrastructural projects required to meet EU and national water and wastewater treatment standards. However, the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-04 contains over 600 water and sewerage schemes at various stages of development which will be processed over the NDP period. Expenditure on the rural water programme, which has been slower than anticipated to date, will pick up over the latter half of the NDP period. The prime indicator for this measure is the number of rural households with an improved water supply. At the end of 2002, 145,000 households – 55% of the end 2006 target – had benefited in this regard. Good progress has been made under the non-national roads measure according to the evaluation of investment in the road network – August 2002, which was carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates. This report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Due to delays in finalising the waste management planning process, the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme was only launched in March 2002. This scheme provides financial assistance to both public and private sectors for the provision of waste recycling and recovery infrastructure. In November 2002, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced the first round of grant allocation to local authorities towards the provision of waste infrastructure. A second round was announced in late April 2003, bringing to €22 million the amount available for recycling and recovery facilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_98">The urban and village renewal measure was not launched until 2001 and experience would suggest that there is a lead-in time before such programmes gather momentum. This is borne out by the pattern of expenditure on the measure to date, whereby of the €28.4 million spend in the period of the NDP to end of last year, some €22.35 million was spent in 2002 itself.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">In relation to heritage projects, good progress has been made since the commencement of the NDP in 2000. Examples include the restoration of the palm house in the National Botanic Gardens, due for completion in the spring of 2004, and of the orangery in Fota arboretum, which is already completed. Planning and design work is also well advanced for the visitor center at Ballycroy National Park, County Mayo.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">My Department is aware of the comments made by the Institute of Engineers of Ireland in their latest report. Good progress is being made on a number of measures, a point acknowledged in the report, but that increased effort is needed to advance programmes in some areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">My Department looks forward to the outcome of the mid-term review of the NDP, which is expected in the latter part of this year and will provide an independent analysis of progress and make appropriate recommendations for programme adjustments, where necessary.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1279">Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, was commenced on 1 November 2000. In accordance with section 94 of the Act, each planning authority was required to prepare a housing strategy by the end of July 2001 and vary its development plan to incorporate the strategy. Variations to the development plans took place up to early 2002. The social and affordable housing conditions could only be applied to planning applications made after the strategies had been incorporated into the development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">In 2002, a total of 46 affordable dwellings as provided under Part V agreements; however, details of the site area required for these units is not retained in my Department. Preliminary returns from local authorities indicate that 13 affordable dwellings as provided in the first quarter of 2003. It is understood that many local authorities are actively engaged in Part V pre-planning discussions-negotiations. While specific details are not available at this stage, it is expected that output this year will be greatly increased.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_1283">There are currently six cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action, or announced that it intends to take legal action, in areas for which my Department has responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The first case concerns the Dangerous Substances Directive (1976/464/EEC). This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 and by related Acts and regulations, that is, the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996. Water quality standards for phosphorus were made in July 1998 and water quality standards for a range of other dangerous substances were made in January 2001. Monitoring by the EPA indicates that the main threat to water quality in Ireland is eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus and, to a lesser extent, nitrates and that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. It is envisaged that the directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive (60/2000/EEC).</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The second case concerns the Nitrates Directive (1991/676/EEC) and the designation of areas as vulnerable zones and the development of action programmes to protect water quality in these areas. Regulations have recently been made which identify on a statutory basis the whole territory of Ireland as the area to which the action programme will be applied. The detailed provisions of the action programme and related research and monitoring programmes will be developed as a matter of urgency, in consultation with the main farming organisations and other interests, with a view to completion this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The third case concerns the adoption of programmes for the protection of designated shellfish in waters in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 79/923/EEC. The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law, and action programmes have recently been made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and notified to the Commission. The need for any additional measures is being considered in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The fourth case relates to a number of waste issues, including progress in the licensing by the EPA of municipal waste landfills, and the regulatory control of waste activities by local authorities and the EPA. Ireland's defence, which has been submitted, is based in part on the fact that relevant requirements of Council Directive 75/442/EEC have been fully transposed under the Waste Management Act 1996 and subordinate regulations, and that the process of licensing municipal landfills is virtually completed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_104">The fifth case concerns the stated intention by the Commission to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice, and seek the application of a daily fire, in order to enforce a previous judgment of the court issued in September 1999 in relation to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, particularly in relation to peat extraction. Environmental impact assessment and planning regulations of December 2001 have addressed the legal implications of the ECJ ruling. My Department announced proposals for the protection of over 100 raised bogs on 18 December 2002. The Commission press release also acknowledged that this was an important step towards making Ireland's new system of protection fully operational. Public consultation on the designations is well advanced.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">The sixth case refers to the Zoos Directive 1999/22/EC which concerns the keeping of wild animals in zoos. The European Commission announced in a press release of 8 April 2003 that Ireland was to be referred to the European Court of Justice for failing to meet the deadline for transposing the directive into national law. My Department is proceeding to do so by way of regulations under existing primary legislation – the European Communities Act 1972. Relevant consultations with existing operators of zoos as defined in Article 2 of the directive, as well as with the relevant State agencies and interest groups, have largely been concluded and the new regulations will be made this year and followed up immediately with the new licensing regime. Given the relatively low number of zoo operators in this State, my Department is confident that all zoos will be licensed soon thereafter.</summary>

Environmental levy receipts to date, that is, to end May 2003, have amounted to €37 million, of which €12 million is in respect of the plastic bag levy, and €25 million for the landfill levy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">As stated in the reply to Question No. 450 of 13 May 2003, it is estimated that during 2003, environmental levy receipts will amount to €39 million, €11 million of which is in respect of the plastic bag levy and €28 million of which is in respect of the landfill levy. Together with €16 million carried over from 2002, it is estimated that in 2003, expenditure from the environment fund will amount to €55 million. The 2003 allocations from the environment fund provide for €30 million waste management capital grants, €17 million to be spent on current waste management and enforcement initiatives and €8 million on non-waste commitments, including pollution control, environmental awareness and the litter initiative.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2163">In April 2003, my Department received the results of the survey of households using homeless accommodation that was carried out jointly by Dublin City Council and the Homeless Agency in January. However, Dublin City Council subsequently raised a number of concerns regarding the reliability of the figures and they are currently re-examining the breakdown of the results of the survey <i>vis-à-vis</i> their homeless waiting list. I understand from the council that it hopes to be able to clarify the matter shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_2167">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 438 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2168">My Department operates a number of measures providing assistance towards the cost of conservation works for protected structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_2169">The conservation grant scheme for protected structures was introduced in 1999 to assist owners or occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2170">The scheme is administered by local authorities, which are allocated a fixed amount of funding for grant purposes in each calendar year. Authorities are required to prioritise applications for assistance on the basis of a scheme of priorities drawn up by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2171">The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works, subject to a maximum of €13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved works, or €25,000, whichever is the lesser. In 2003, an amount of €2.888 million has been made available to local authorities under this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2172">In addition to the protected structures scheme, funding of €1.132 million is available in 2003 under the urban and village renewal measure of the regional operational programmes, in respect of the upgrade of buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. Applications for funding under this scheme were invited from local authorities, civic trust and other not-for-profit bodies, and the available funding has been allocated to 55 specific projects following their evaluation by an advisory panel.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_117">My Department also operates a scheme of grants to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs. The basic maximum grant is €3,810, €5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands, and there are additional measures to assist lower income households. A sum of €734,000 has been allocated for this scheme in 2003. The Heritage Council is also providing €1.27 million in grant aid this year for architectural conservation projects. In all, some €6 million is being made available this year from public funds for the conservation of structures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">Annual allocations for conservation grant schemes are determined having regard to the wider budgetary situation. My Department will continue to monitor the operation and effectiveness of these schemes.</summary>

Under the directive, member states must ensure that the last holder-owner can deliver his-her end-of-life vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge and that the relevant economic operators meet all, or a significant part of, the costs of implementing these measures. The directive also requires member states to introduce a system whereby certificates of destruction are notified to the competent vehicle registration authorities on foot of the deposit of vehicles for scrapping.</p>
          <p eId="para_2175">Agreement in principle has been reached by the economic sectors to establish a not for profit company to operate an ELV recovery scheme which will be subsidised by a fund generated by environmental levies on imported new and used vehicles.

          <p eId="para_2177">I am aware of the views of the Simon Community on the funding for homelessness in 2003. It must be emphasised that funding for accommodation-related services for homeless persons has increased substantially in recent years. Last year my Department recouped €43 million, or 90% of the cost, to local authorities towards their expenditure on the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless people, compared to €12.5 million in 1999. Local authorities provided a further €4.8 million from their own resources. This year, in spite of a tightening financial situation an increased allocation of €50 million has been provided by my Department for this purpose. A substantial proportion of this expenditure will be provided to voluntary bodies to fund the accommodation, day services and settlement and outreach programmes they operate. All requests for funding by local authorities for projects which provide accommodation and related services for homeless people, the majority of which are operated by voluntary bodies, have been met by my Department. This increase in funding is clear evidence of the Government's determination to address the issue of homelessness in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way.</p>

My Department is actively considering the issues involved, including a report prepared by Comhar – the national sustainable development partnership – which suggests that levies could be considered for problematic waste streams, subject to proper evaluation. While my Department is examining the issues raised in the Comhar report, final decisions have not yet been taken on the products which should be targeted as a priority and further study may be required before any final decisions can be made on the introduction of additional environmental levies.</p>

The Ringsend waste water treatment plant, the largest such project hitherto constructed in Ireland, will deal with the wastewater treatment requirement of all of Dublin city and south Dublin, significant areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and parts of County Meath.

          <p eId="para_2194">The Government published the national spatial strategy on 28 November 2002 as a 20-year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential. The strategy aims to build up the strengths of all areas, to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area and to achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_126">Regional and local authorities are key players in taking forward the spatial strategy, starting with the preparation and adoption by regional authorities of regional planning guidelines under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Immediately following the publication of the strategy, I attended a number of events at regional level to brief a wide cross-section of interested parties on the strategy and to start the process of rolling it out to the regions. In February 2003, guidance notes for regional authorities on preparing regional planning guidelines were issued by my Department to all such authorities. The authorities, working in partnership with local authorities, have now commenced this work with the aim of ensuring that the guidelines are in place in all regions by early 2004. A number of the regional authorities have published papers for public consultation in relation to the preparation of regional planning guidelines in their regions and the other regional authorities will do so shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made two legal instruments to support this process on 1 May 2003. The Planning and Development (Regional Planning Guidelines) Direction 2003 formally directs each regional authority to make regional planning guidelines for its region. The Dublin and mid-east regional authorities have been directed to jointly review the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area and to make new regional planning guidelines for the combined area of their regions. The Planning and Development (Regional Planning Guidelines) Regulations 2003 set out a number of requirements in relation to the preparation of regional planning guidelines. In particular, the regulations specify that the national spatial strategy is of relevance to the determination of strategic planning policies. This means that regional authorities are obliged to take account of the strategy when making regional planning guidelines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">Structures and mechanisms to integrate the national spatial strategy into planning and activities at Government, Department, State agency, regional and local level are also being put in place to ensure that the strategy directs the spatial aspects of public sector planning, policies and programmes, including the determination of investment priorities. The strategy has already shaped the strategic rail review and the development of the Forfás regional investment strategy. It will also influence the mid-term review of the national development plan, to be completed this year. An interdepartmental steering group, similar to that which oversaw preparation of the strategy, has been established and will now oversee its implementation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_129">The successful development of gateways and hubs will require the establishment of integrated spatial frameworks for land use, planning, urban design, transport and public service delivery. The relevant local authorities have primary responsibility for driving the preparation of these frameworks, in consultation with relevant public agencies, including those responsible for the provision of transport and other infrastructure, and translating them into statutory development plans to guide the development process. Work on the preparation of such frameworks is well advanced in some gateways and other gateways and hubs are being advised to advance their plans as quickly as possible.</summary>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_716">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2334">The Health and Safety Authority, as part of its normal procedures following an accident, is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of the spillage of nitric acid from a vehicle in Mulhuddart on 10 June 2003. The focus of this investigation is to determine whether or not the goods were being transported in accordance with the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_2335">As the investigation has not been completed I cannot comment further on the particulars of this case or speculate on possible causes or factors pending the outcome of that investigation and any possible action that may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_2336">The transport of dangerous goods by road is regulated by the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations, 2001 – SI 492 of 2001, made under the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act 1998. These regulations apply to the carriage, both in bulk and in packages, of dangerous goods by road, including the loading and unloading of the dangerous goods in relation to their carriage. They give effect to a UN Convention, the ADR international agreement on the transport of dangerous goods by road as well as relevant EU directives. The regulations set out a comprehensive framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by road.</p>
          <p eId="para_2337">The regulations impose duties on the consignor and on the carrier of the dangerous goods and on the driver of the vehicle carrying the goods. They contain requirements for the vehicles, tanks, tank containers, receptacles and packages containing the dangerous goods during their carriage. They require that the drivers and others, involved in the carriage of the dangerous goods by road, including their loading and unloading, be adequately trained and, in the case of drivers, hold certificates of such training. They also contain provisions on an EC harmonised approach to the road checks aspect of their enforcement.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_145">In general the duties of consignors and carriers include: goods must be stowed and secured so as to preclude any loss of contents; packaging must be labelled in accordance with ADR requirements; provision of written instructions to the driver; ensuring that the driver understands the instructions. The duties of the driver include: not driving unless trained; safeguarding the goods in transport; ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">It should be noted that in an incident such as this there are responsibilities attaching to a number of other statutory bodies including the Garda, the fire services and the relevant local authority who were involved both in responding to this incident and in its aftermath. The role of the Health and Safety Authority represents only one element of any general emergency response to an incident such as this.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2354">I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 to 159, inclusive, and 162 and 167 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2355">Funding amounting to €274.3 million is being provided for the administration of the community employment programme, CE, during 2003. Due to the tight budgetary situation facing Government it will not be possible to increase the funding already allocated to FÁS for the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2356">The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects, including projects in Dublin 24, is a matter for FÁS. FÁS is endeavouring to manage the allocation of places to individual projects as equitably as possible.

        <summary eId="sum_147">A number of reviews of CE are currently under way. The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives, which I expect should be completed by the third quarter of 2003, will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2358">The practice of the work permit section of my Department in regard to liquidations is that where the employee is let go and finds another job, it will facilitate the early processing of a new work permit application from the new employer. In addition, the new employer is excused from the requirement to advertise the position with FÁS in advance of making the application for the work permit. Where the business re-opens under a new owner but is otherwise unchanged the existing work permit will continue to be valid. If the company in liquidation is taken over and is incorporated into another business under a new name the new employer should apply for the work permit.</p>

          <p eId="para_2367">IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility, assigned to it by the Oireachtas, for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. I have been informed by IDA Ireland that there were three visits by overseas investors to County Monaghan in 2002, one in 2001 and two in 2000. IDA Ireland is actively promoting County Monaghan as a potential location to overseas investors through its network of overseas offices. However, it is the overseas investors that ultimately decide on location, including potential locations they wish to visit. IDA Ireland assures me that it are doing everything it can to secure high value sustainable employment opportunities for the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_2368">Monaghan is one of four towns of emphasis in the north east region for the agency and is strongly marketed for new investment. In addition, IDA Ireland is participating in the Armagh-Monaghan digital corridor initiative, which is geared towards encouraging enterprises with a requirement for advanced telecoms to locate on both sides of the Border where the telecommunications networks of both jurisdictions can be accessed. I am confident that the efforts and strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results for the people of Monaghan.</p>

          <p eId="para_2372">Job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one for which I as Minister have direct involvement. Only a small number of the jobs announced in any given year would normally be expected to be created within the same year, as there is usually a time lag between the announcement of new jobs and the creation of those jobs. Factors which influence this time lag are the time taken to locate and acquire a suitable site for the company's operations, construct the facility, install plant and machinery – in the case of manufacturing plants – and recruit and train staff. It should also be noted that frequently the number of jobs quoted in announcements refers to the number of jobs which a company expects to create over a number of years.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_153">The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland in regard to the development of indigenous industry, IDA Ireland in regard to the attraction of inward investment and Shannon Development in the Shannon region. As far as Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development's areas of responsibility are concerned, between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002, a total of 2,417 new jobs were announced in the agencies' client companies. Some 1,797 of these were in the south and east region and 920 in the BMW. By the end of 2002, 526 new jobs were created in these companies, 77 of which were in the BMW region and 449 in the south and east region. In all, totals of 15,810 and 12,863 jobs were created in 2001 and 2002 respectively by Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development-supported companies. In 2003 to the end of May, a total of 300 jobs were announced in respect of these agencies' client companies, 210 in the BMW region and 90 in the south and east region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">In relation to IDA companies, in the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002, 6,950 new jobs were announced, 2,918 in the BMW region and 4,032 in the south and east region. By November 2002, the date of the latest Forfás annual employment survey, 838 of these jobs had been created in green-field projects – 134 in the BMW region and 704 in the south and east region – while total employment in companies where expansions were announced was 4,273 – 3,390 in the BMW region and 883 in the south and east region. In all, totals of 13,282 and 11,743 jobs were created in 2001 and 2002 respectively in IDA Ireland supported client companies. In 2003 to the end of May, a total of 3,346 jobs were announced in respect of IDA Ireland supported client companies – 1,670 in the BMW region and 1,676 in the south and east region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">Job creation figures for 2003 will not be available until November 2003, the date of the next Forfás annual employment survey. It is quite clear that most of these job announcements are currently on target, if not ahead of schedule.

In this regard, I have responsibility for the appointment of the registrar of the Labour Court and the chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Under statute, the criteria for selecting these officers require them to have been practising barristers or solicitors for a number of years prior to appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2442">Regarding the Labour Court, the registrar, Mr. Hugh O'Neill is paid an annual salary of €31,779.00. The chairperson of the Employment Appeals Tribunal currently Ms. Kate O'Mahony, is paid on a <i>per diem</i> basis for each sitting day of the tribunal. The total amount paid to the holder of the position since 1997 was €258,102. Under company law, I have no authority to appoint legal teams to tribunals, inquiries or other public committees of investigation. Following the recent establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, future company law investigations are the responsibility of the director.</p>
          <p eId="para_2443">In response to a question from the Deputy, I recently provided the House with information in relation to the various company law inquiries under way since 1997. In that regard, I indicated that the legal costs of those inquiries are being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. The position remains unchanged in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_4542">Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland and no change in this regard is contemplated.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_181">Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so in relation to the use of Casement aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 however, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit. Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.</summary>

I have no plans to amend this eligibility requirement. The professional advice of the medical corps and the actual experience of training units is that persons of shorter stature encounter difficulties in carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment.

          <p eId="para_4565">The Irish position on GMOs in agriculture was reflected in the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology which was published in 2001 as being positive but precautionary. This position was an acknowledgement of the potential benefits of genetic engineering while at the same time maintaining the precautionary principle. I do not have any proposals at present to initiate a formal public consultation process regarding the development of genetically modified animals and crops. I would, however, point out that among the inputs to the work of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology were the findings of the national consultation debate on genetically modified organisms and the environment, published in July 1999, following public debate arranged by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 1998. There are no genetically modified crops or farm animals currently being grown or bred on a commercial or experimental basis in this country.</p>

      <b>Mr. S. Power</b>
      asked the

      if he will consider the labelling of all meat products sold here in view of the huge amount of imported meat.
      [16482/03]

          <p eId="para_4567">All meat products must be labelled in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the general labelling legislation. With regard to beef, EU labelling regulations introduced in 2000 require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their product with a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_182">For the purpose of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing up to and including sale through retail outlets. On a wider scale where meat and meat products are imported, the above labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the European Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported in to the Community from a third country and not all the above details are available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC" along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. As the Deputy will be aware, last year I established an expert group to look at the whole issue of food labelling, including beef – and also other meats where EU labelling requirements are not as extensive. In its report, which it presented to me in December 2002, the group made a number of recommendations relating to the labelling of origin: Information on the origin of fresh, chilled and frozen sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat sold in retail outlets, prepackaged or otherwise, should be declared; information on the origin of the primary meat protein source – beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat – sold in the food service sector should be provided to the consumer; consumer research should be carried out to establish (a) how origin should be defined in respect of fresh, chilled and frozen sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat sold in retailoutlets, (b) how origin should be defined in respect of the primary meat protein source – beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry meat – sold in the food service sector and (c) the usefulness-effectiveness of the beef labelling regulations from a consumer perspective; only where an imported food product undergoes substantial transformation in the importing country can the name of the importing country be given as the country of origin on the label or at the point of sale-consumption. To this effect "substantial transformation" should be clearly defined and harmonised across all EU member states.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">I have established an inter-agency committee to progress the recommendations contained within this report. The committee comprises of representatives of all Departments involved in food labelling, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board. At my request, the consumer liaison panel has devised a strategy for consumer research on this issue and I have allocated funding for this. The consumer liaison panel has sought tenders to carry out this research. I anticipate that the research should commence shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4615">The person named applied for a total of 188 animals under the 2002 special beef premium scheme and was selected for a producer inspection. During the inspection it was established that two of the animals on the holding were non-compliant with the identification and registration requirements. A total of seven animals were rejected for payment from the first five applications as having been previously paid special beef premium in the age category for which they were submitted; one animal was rejected as having died before the date of application and one animal was rejected for non-compliance with the Cattle Movement Monitoring System, CMMS. The 80% advance was paid in respect of the remaining 145 animals on the first five applications.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_184">The sixth special beef premium application was in respect of 34 animals, two of which were rejected as premium was previously paid. One animal has been rejected for payment as it was slaughtered prior to the date of application and one further animal has been rejected due to CMMS non-compliance. The advance payment on the 30 eligible animals will be paid shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">The balancing payment for special beef premium will issue later this month and will be reduced to take into account reductions for identification and registration non-compliance and breaches of scheme rules. As the person named has applied on in excess of 50 animals under the special beef premium scheme, the number of animals on which premium will be paid will be reduced in line with the quota overshoot rate, which will be finalised this week.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">The person named applied for 2002 slaughter premium in respect of 174 animals. Some 30 of these animals were heifers under 30 months of age at slaughter and therefore are eligible for national envelope top up. Payment in respect of both of these schemes will issue shortly now that the outstanding special beef premium issues have been resolved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_187">Under the 2002 ewe premium scheme and ewe premium national envelope the person named was paid €924.00 and €55.44 in respect of 44 ewes on 16 October 2002 and 3 March 2003, respectively. The person named participated in 2002 extensification premium, opting for the census system. A stocking density of 1.177 livestock units per hectare has been established for the holding. Where the stocking density of a holding is less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare, payment may issue at the rate of €80 for each animal that has already qualified for payment in the holding of 2002 special beef premium and-or suckler cow premium. Extensification premium for 2002 cannot issue until the 2002 special beef premium balancing payment has been paid.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4684">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that when they became aware of allegations regarding the use of an offshore investment vehicle by customers of a particular bank, they initiated an immediate investigation into the matter. They identified 452 Irish resident taxpayers who had invested funds in the offshore entity Clerical Medical Insurance and the investigation largely focused on those who had previously undeclared tax liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_4685">To date, Revenue has collected a total of €45.94 million comprising tax, interest and penalties. This is made up of €40.98 million paid in 274 settled cases and €4.96 million in payments on account in cases still under investigation. I understand that 97 cases were finalised with no additional liability arising. Investigations are proceeding in the remaining cases, 15 of which are likely to give rise to very little liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_4686">I understand that four cases are being dealt with in the investigations and prosecutions division and three of these are currently before the courts. One who pleaded guilty was fined in the District Court in Mullingar on 19 May 2003. The other 2 cases were referred to the Circuit Court for trial. The remaining case is under ongoing investigation with a view to prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_4687">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appointed High Court Inspectors to inquire into issues relating to the bank, including tax related ones.

          <p eId="para_4690">Section 140 of the Finance Act 2003 gave legislative effect to the stamp duty increase from €19 to €40 per annum on credit card accounts which I announced in budget 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_4691">Under the previous legislation, the stamp duty on credit cards was in respect of an account maintained by the bank on 1 April. However, people could cancel their cards in a particular manner so as to avoid the annual charge. In view of this, an anti-avoidance provision was included in the Finance Act 2003 for credit cards to ensure that a stamp duty charge will arise where the account is maintained by the bank at any time during the 12 month period ending on 1 April rather than maintained specifically on 1 April. This change is effective where the charge arises after 1 April 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_191">If an individual having used a card at any time cancels the credit card after 1 April in a year, a further stamp duty charge of €40 is payable on closure of the account, as the account had been maintained by the financial institution at any time during the year ending on 1 April of the following year. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">There are revenue implications in any change to the current provisions. For that reason I will keep this matter under consideration in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill, which is the normal context for any changes in taxation arrangements.</summary>

The net cost of pay and pensions is €12.7 billion or 50% of net voted current spending.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_196">The most recent projections for expenditure in 2004 are those published as part of the Budget 2003 documentation on 4 December last. On the basis of those projections, gross pay in 2004 would be around 40% of total gross expenditure. Definitive pay figures for 2004 will not be available until the Estimates for expenditure for that year are agreed by the Government later this year. These figures will be detailed in the 2004 pre-budget Estimates which I expect to publish, as normal, in November next.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4840">Our concerns about the incident in Portadown on 8 June last were conveyed at an early stage to the British authorities through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_4841">In their response, the British authorities have confirmed that a number of buses were stoned that evening whilst travelling through Portadown from a GAA match in Belfast. The police state that they were unable to take the necessary action to prevent this incident occurring as they were unaware of the route supporters would be taking or numbers involved. They further state that, in the past, they have had communication with local GAA representatives when large numbers of supporters were known to be travelling, especially at contentious times, and that buses would normally use alternative routes, especially when the details of large games are well known.</p>
          <p eId="para_4842">Following a meeting between the police and local GAA officials, it has been agreed that in future, when advance notice is given to police of GAA supporters travelling via this route in convoy from the Monaghan area, then the police will assist. Alternative routes to prevent a reoccurrence were also discussed at the meeting.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_199">On a general note, the Government remains concerned about the level of sectarian attacks on persons and property in Portadown and elsewhere. As the marching season unfolds this year, officials of my Department will maintain regular contact with local political and community representatives and with the British authorities, through the British-Irish intergovernmental secretariat, in order to identify possible problems at an early stage. The Taoiseach and I will also continue to work closely with the British Government and the political parties to address the issues surrounding sectarian violence, to bring about effective policing of interface areas, to make sure that increased additional security measures are available to residents of these areas when required, and to ensure that the right to freedom from sectarian harassment, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, is upheld.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">It should also be acknowledged that there has been some progress already this year in terms of closer community contacts in certain interface areas, with the results evident in calmer parades in east Belfast and elsewhere recently. The Government welcomes and encourages such contacts and we call on community workers and elected representatives from interface areas to do their utmost in the weeks ahead to ensure a peaceful summer.</summary>

On the expiry of the embargo on 17 January 2000, a review was carried out by the EU and, due to the developments in Indonesia at the time, which included the first ever contested presidential elections, a change of government and the relinquishing of Indonesia's territorial claim to East Timor, it was decided that the arms embargo was no longer necessary, and should not be renewed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_203">However, all exports of arms from EU countries must conform with the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control the export of arms. Ireland was involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods.

          <p eId="para_4851">On 31 October 2000, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1325 on Women and Peace and Security, a resolution which for the first time addressed the issue of the particular effects of conflict on women and girls and the particular contribution women make to peace processes and thus the importance of their central involvement in negotiations aimed at ending conflict, as well as in post-conflict peace-building.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_206">Resolution 1325 called for a report from the Secretary General but did not specify a time for its delivery. When it became apparent that the report would not be ready in time for discussion at the first anniversary of the adoption of Resolution 1325, Ireland, during its Presidency of the Security Council, sought the adoption of a Presidential statement by the Council which would sustain impetus in the issue until the appearance and discussion of the report. I had the honour of presiding over the adoption of this Presidential statement [PRST/2001/31] by the Security Council on 31 October 2001. Later that day, as President of the Security Council, I represented the Council in a UN panel discussion on how to advance the implementation of Resolution 1325 so that women are centrally involved in peace-making and post-conflict peace-building.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_207">When the Secretary General's report on women and peace and security was issued and subsequently discussed at an open meeting of the Security Council on 28 October 2002, Ireland strongly supported its central thesis, that in order to respond effectively to the needs and priorities of women and girls during armed conflict, gender perspectives had to be integrated systematically into all peace-building, peace-keeping and peace-making efforts as well as during humanitarian operations and reconstruction processes. Accordingly, Ireland contended publicly that the work of gender-mainstreaming, the process of assessing the implications for men and women of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas at all levels, needed to be at the centre of the UN's work. Appreciation was also expressed subsequently to Ireland that its statement had commended the independent study on women and peace and security undertaken by UNIFEM, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, which had been conducted in parallel to the Secretary General's report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_208">Ireland participated actively in the negotiations that led to the adoption, on 31 October 2002, of a Presidential statement [PRST/2002/32] which,inter alia, reaffirmed the importance of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations and post-conflict reconstruction and undertook to integrate gender perspectives into the mandates of all peacekeeping missions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_209">The Secretary General's report set out a number of challenges inter alia on the participation of women in peace processes, the inclusion of gender perspectives in the mandates of peace operations and the need to ensure the respect for the human rights of women and girls as well as their access to humanitarian assistance. Progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the incorporation of gender perspectives into a number of peacekeeping operations. For example, a gender affairs unit was included in the UN's mission in East Timor. There is still, however, much that needs to be done on the part of member states, and within the United Nations – in headquarters and in the field – to ensure the participation of women in peace-building and to ensure that the specific concerns of women and girls are incorporated into all efforts aimed at the promotion of peace and security.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_210">I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, while no longer a member of the Security Council, will continue to work to secure the implementation of the aims of Resolution 1325.</summary>

The Irish Embassy in Abuja has also conveyed the Government's concern about such sentences to the Nigerian authorities. It is the conviction of this Government that such sentences are in contravention of Nigeria's obligations under international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Government is also concerned about other sentences handed down in Sharia courts, including flogging and amputations, and has called on the Nigerian Federal Government to fulfil its obligations under human rights law.</p>
          <p eId="para_4854">The EU has also made its views known to the Nigerian federal authorities and, in August 2002, issued a declaration expressing its concern that a Sharia court of appeal had upheld a sentence of death by stoning for adultery on a woman.

The Government of Zimbabwe has primary responsibility for this state of affairs. It has failed to call to account all those who have acted outside the law, particularly through harassment and repression of peaceful protesters and members of the opposition. The continued detention on a second charge of treason of the leader of the opposition MDC party, Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai, is very worrying. On 6 June, the EU issued a declaration noting that the arrest of Mr. Tsvangirai demonstrated an increase in the repressive and intimidatory measures being used by the Government of Zimbabwe against the opposition. The EU declaration urged the Government of Zimbabwe to find a peaceful solution to the political conflict through national dialogue and respect for human rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_4859">I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4860">On a number of occasions in recent months, I have set out the Government's position with respect to Tibet.</p>
          <p eId="para_4861">As regards greater autonomy for Tibet within the People's Republic of China, the recent visit, from 28 May to 5 June, of a delegation of the Dalai Lama's envoys to China, appears to have resulted in a positive dialogue. The Dalai Lama has stated that he seeks a solution to the Tibetan problem through a "Middle Way Approach". This framework does not call for the independence of Tibet or its separation from China, but would provide genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people, help them to preserve their identity, and to promote their religious and cultural heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_4862">With regard to the human rights situation in Tibet, the Government, in bilateral contacts with China, and through contacts between the European Union and China, has consistently called on the Chinese Government to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_4863">The EU discusses key human rights concerns, including those relating to Tibet, with China in the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which provides a forum for an in-depth discussion of these issues. The last session of the dialogue took place on 5 and 6 March 2003, in Athens. Among the issues discussed were the general human rights situation in Tibet and the continued use of re-education-through-labour, as well as other issues such as co-operation with UN human rights mechanisms, the continuation of "strike-hard" campaigns, the need for judicial reforms, the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, torture and the extensive use of the death penalty. The EU continues to evaluate the results of the dialogue at regular intervals to determine how far its expectations have been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_4864">I attended the External Relations Council meeting in Brussels in March this year, at which the Council issued conclusions on the human rights situation in China, including Tibet. These conclusions restated the EU's concern about the continuing practice of re-education-through-labour, and called on China to end the practice.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_211">At the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland, along with our EU partners, made known our concerns in regard to human rights violations in China and, in particular, our concerns in relation to the deprivation of religious and cultural rights in Tibet.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">Ireland, together with our EU partners, will avail of every opportunity to raise our concerns regarding the situation of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, as well as through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4866">The Government takes seriously the issue of respect for the human rights of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Both the Taoiseach and I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Chinese Government, and we will continue to use such bilateral contacts to further the cause of human rights in China. I raised this matter directly with the Chinese authorities during my visit to Beijing in January 2002. In December 2002, and again in February 2003, my colleague Deputy Kitt, Minister of State for overseas development and human rights, reviewed these issues with concerned NGOs. Government representatives will continue to use such bilateral contacts to raise human rights issues with the Chinese authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_4867">The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue. At the most recent session of the dialogue, which took place in Athens on 5-6 March this year, the EU conveyed our concerns in relation to the position of followers of Falun Gong. I am pleased to report that the Chinese interlocutors at the dialogue expressed a willingness to co-operate with the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, and informed the EU side that they had extended invitations to visit China to the UN special rapporteurs on torture, and the right to education, and to the UN working group on arbitrary detention. I particularly welcome the fact that China has also issued a formal invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_213">At the External Relations Council in March this year, I discussed this matter with my EU colleagues, and it was agreed that the EU should convey its deep concern over reported violations of human rights in China, at the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the recent session of the CHR in Geneva, the EU urged China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation generally, and more specifically with respect to freedoms of expression, religion and belief, which have a particular impact on practitioners of Falun Gong.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4869">The incident to which the Deputy refers was the subject of a statement by the European Union Presidency on 11 June last.</p>
          <p eId="para_4870">In strongly condemning the attacks the Greek Presidency stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_4871">This kind of retaliation and extra judicial killings perpetuate the cycle of violence and further deteriorate the security environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_4872">These attacks, that coincide with the first steps of the implementation of the Roadmap following the pledges taken by both sides in Aqaba, undermine the peace efforts and complicate further PM Abbas' attempts to halt violence and terrorism by Palestinian factions. In this crucial period, we call upon both parties to abstain from acts of violence and to remain committed to the path of negotiations, which is the only way to satisfy the people's need for peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_4873">These sentiments are fully endorsed by the Government of Ireland. The deaths and injuries caused in the Israeli attacks have undoubtedly made the task of peace makers much more difficult. As the Deputy will be aware, it is the firm position of the Government that political problems must be resolved without recourse to violence or terrorism.</p>

          <p eId="para_4875">The Political and Security Committee was formally established on a permanent basis early in 2001, having met on an interim basis since March 2000. It was subsequently given a Treaty basis in Article 25 of the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force in March 2003. This provides that the Political and Security Committee monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and contributes to the definition of policies by delivering opinions to the Council, at the request of the Council or on its own initiative. The Council may also authorise the Political and Security Committee to take the relevant decisions, if and when authorised by the Council, concerning the political control and strategic direction of a crisis management operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_4876">Member states are represented on the Political and Security Committee by Brussels-based officials at senior official level, operating on instructions from the respective governments. Ireland is represented on the Political and Security Committee by Ambassador Declan Kelleher, who is assisted by officials drawn from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence, as well as from the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_4877">The committee meets several times a week, with an agenda covering the spectrum of issues arising in the Common Foreign and Security Policy area. Ireland plays an active role at the committee, having regard to our interest in maintaining a stable, inclusive security environment and the pursuit of our national foreign and security policy objectives in the formulation and conduct of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ireland also contributes actively to the particular role of the Political and Security Committee in carrying forward work on the European Security and Defence Policy, under the guidance of the Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_4881">Batasuna, together with the related organisations Herri Batasuna and Euskal Herritarrok, were proscribed as aliases of the terrorist organisation ETA, following a vote of the Spanish Parliament on 26 August 2002 and a decision of the Spanish Supreme Court on 17 March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_4882">In addition, I understand that there is a separate investigation by Judge Baltasar Garzón into the activities of Batasuna and other organisations related to ETA.</p>
          <p eId="para_4883">Under the terms of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP, EU member states shall, through police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, afford each other the widest possible assistance in preventing and combating terrorist acts. In this context, the EU as a whole decided on 5 June 2003 to add Batasuna, and the related organisations, to the list established by Common Position 2001/931/CFSP.</p>
          <p eId="para_4884">As I understand the situation, ETA has not abandoned the use of force. Nor have ETA or the political party associated with it, Batasuna, committed themselves to exclusively peaceful and democratic means of pursuing their aims. Regrettably, as recently as 30 May two policemen were killed in a car bomb attack attributed to ETA. There can be no place in our democracies for the use or threat of the use of force. The interest of all the people of the Basque country would be best served by a decision by ETA to desist from violence and, together with their associates in Batasuna, commit themselves exclusively to peaceful and democratic means of pursuing their aims.</p>

I urge the Indonesian Government and GAM to resume negotiations without delay, as dialogue between the parties, and a commitment to honour fully their obligations under the cease-fire agreement of 19 December 2002, represent the only way to resolve this conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_4996">On 19 May, at the outset of the current military action, the Indonesia Government stated that the operation was to have an integrated approach, consisting of military action, humanitarian aid, the restoration of civil institutions and upholding the rule of law. The Indonesian authorities have a duty to guarantee public order and security in Aceh, and protect the Acehnese people from any collateral damage caused by the military operation. The humanitarian needs of the people of Aceh should be given the utmost priority. The Indonesian government also has a duty to guard against human rights violations, and to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of human rights defenders.</p>

We stressed at the same time, the EU's belief that the Indonesian Government should further pursue its commitment to human rights, and to ensure stability and security in Indonesia, with full respect for the law. The Council further urged the government to address humanitarian needs, and make further progress in political, judicial and legal reforms.

          <p eId="para_4998">Reform of the Security Council is one of the more contentious issues facing the UN membership. In the 1993, the General Assembly, with a view to addressing this issue in a comprehensive way, decided to establish a working group, open to all UN member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_4999">The working group has been meeting regularly in New York since 1993, with Ireland as an active participant, but it has to be said that progress to date on this very complex issue has been disappointing. The key issues are the enlargement of the Council, the reform of its working methods, and the manner in which it reaches its decisions, including the use of the veto. While there has been some progress in the reform of the Council's working methods, there has been none on either enlargement or the decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_5000">As regards enlargement, Ireland's overall position is to support a small, regionally balanced increase in both the permanent and the elected membership that would bring Security Council membership to between 20 and 25. Ireland believes that this should not be achieved at the expense of the smaller member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_5001">As regards decision-making, Ireland would like to see the use of the veto by the permanent members eliminated altogether. The Government recognises, however, the strong opposition of the permanent members and, in a spirit of realism and practicality, has proposed that they accept a limitation of the veto whereby they would exercise it only when the question at hand was one of vital importance, taking into account the interest of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time, any new permanent members of the Council would commit themselves not to exercise the veto.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_225">The working group continues to meet and Ireland has been active in working for consensus on the basis of our principled position. The Government remain open to any opportunity that might arise for making proposals, procedural or substantive. Any such proposal would need to be weighed very carefully, so as to be assured of contributing to progress in the negotiation. This matter will accordingly remain under appropriate review.</summary>

This appeal included essential relief items such as food, non-food, clothing, and health needs, with a particular emphasis on water and sanitation requirements for a six month period. The Government approved funding of €150,000 to the IFRC appeal on the 26 May 2003.</summary>

The SLRCS is part of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC, and the federation has mobilised international emergency response units with specialised knowledge in disaster management.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">The IFRC is a valued partner of Ireland Aid, the Government's official programme of development co-operation. The IFRC's rapid response to the disaster in Sri Lanka emphasises, once again, the importance played by local organisations in responding immediately to local emergencies. Experience has taught us that many of the lives saved in the immediate aftermath of a disaster are saved by the local communities themselves and their organisations and agencies. International assistance is also vital, but there is an increasing emphasis now being placed on building local capacity for disaster preparedness.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5006">The Government recognises that HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in poorer countries which are recipients of development assistance and that progress in poverty reduction in these countries cannot be made in the absence of an urgent, resourced and sustained response to HIV-AIDS. A growing aid budget has facilitated substantial increases in the volume of financial resources allocated by Ireland Aid to programmes which respond to the HIV-AIDS pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_5007">In his address to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS in 2001, the Taoiseach emphasised the importance of political leadership, improved co-ordination and more financial resources in combatting the HIV-AIDS pandemic. He announced that additional resources of $30 million would be spent each year within the Ireland Aid programme as part of the Government's response to this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_5008">In line with this commitment, some €30.5 million will be set aside in 2003 for a dedicated HIV-AIDS budget line under subhead B of my Department's Vote for International Co-operation. In addition, funds are available for HIV-AIDS-related activities under a variety of other budget lines across the Vote, bringing total expenditure on the sector to more than €50 million in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_5009">HIV-AIDS represents a core focus of our aid programme. The approach taken by Ireland Aid to the issue is guided by the Government's strategy document, "An HIV-AIDS Strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme", published in 2000. Individual HIV-AIDS strategies, furthermore, have been approved for each programme country benefiting from Ireland Aid support. In addition, funding is also allocated through UN agencies, NGOs and bilaterally in our programme countries.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_230">Support for education and raising awareness of HIV-AIDS is, and will continue to be, an integral component of the approach under the Ireland Aid programme. The approach within the programme countries is to support ministries of education at central and district levels to mainstream their approach. This encompasses the inclusion of HIV-AIDS as part of the teacher training curriculum and also ensuring that education material is available to pupils in schools. A particular focus within the education sector is the education of girls regarding HIV-AIDS transmission as they are more vulnerable to HIV-AIDS and in many instances become the carers for those who become ill with the disease.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">Ireland is also a member of the inter-agency task team on education, IATTE, which promotes a more co-ordinated approach to dealing with HIV-AIDS within the education sector. We will host a meeting of the IATTE in November. The IATTE have also held a number of regional workshops in Africa to enable education officials to share experiences across the countries and to plan a more comprehensive response.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">We need to retain a flexible and holistic approach to the HIV-AIDS crisis which will focus on all factors, including education. Against the backdrop of the integrated approach and the priority accorded to education within our HIV-AIDS strategy, the establishment of a separate budget heading for HIV-AIDS education is not considered necessary.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5063">As the Deputy will be aware, the promotion of equality in, and access to higher education has been one of my key policy priorities since taking office. My overriding objective is to target those who are most in need and to do so at an appropriate level.</p>
          <p eId="para_5064">Foundation level courses, which are referred to in this PQ, have never been approved for funding under third level access programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_5065">In 2001-02 some colleges supported foundation level courses from funds made available by my Department from its disadvantaged initiatives. This was owing to a misinterpretation or lack of clarity in the guidelines issued. This matter was clarified early in 2003 when the Department became aware of the situation. It has not been the practice of the Department to approve the provision of foundation year courses therefore the question of withdrawal does not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_5066">There have been questions raised about the value of putting students from disadvantaged backgrounds through year long foundation courses for some time now. The Commission on the Points System was not convinced that such courses were appropriate for third level institutions and suggested they should be provided under further education schemes. Equally the action group on third level access commented on the need for appropriate validation of such courses and considered that they should not be a requirement for all access students.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_244">My Department has increased the funding for third level access measures from €508,000 in 1997 to €26 million in the current year. This underlines my commitment to access for disadvantaged students to third level. In addition, the Department provides dedicated funding to the Higher Education Authority and the institutes of technology to broaden access for students from traditionally under-represented groups. In 2002, this amounted to some €6 million.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5109">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_248">The appeals board on mainstream staffing allocations referred to by the Deputy was established in August 2002 and commenced operation at the start of the current school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, against the mainstream staffing schedule as issued to schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">There are five members on the appeal board, Dr. Tom McCarthy, chairperson, Mr. Frank Davis, Ms Monica Healy, Ms Mairead McGowan and Mr. Seán Nolan. As the appeal board does not have separate offices, appeal applications are submitted to the board through the primary payments section of my Department. It is expected that the board will meet at least three times annually.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">The appeals board will not accept applications directly from parents, individual teachers or other third parties. Applications must be made by the board of management of the school concerned. Representations to individual members of the appeals board by a board of management or a person acting on behalf of a board of management will not be allowed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">The appeals board operates independently of my Department and its decisions are final. It is not open to me or my Department to interfere in the operation of the board. Decisions of the appeal board are communicated to the board of management of the school which submits the appeal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_252">I issued an information booklet on the appeals board to all members of the Oireachtas in December 2002. I am arranging to have a further copy of the booklet forwarded to the Deputy.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5122">A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy schoolbags and in particular: (i) the extent of the problem; (ii) the factors which contribute to the problem; and (iii) possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils. The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications not only for my Department but also for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_5123">The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags. In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_5124">Positive action has been taken by many schools.

          <p eId="para_5132">For the purposes of my Department's maintenance grants schemes, reckonable income means all amounts, with the exception of defined social welfare and health board payments, received or receivable by an individual without reference to his/her residence or domicile, from both Irish and foreign sources, which are liable to Irish income tax, Irish capital gains tax or Irish capital acquisitions tax, or which would be so liable but for exemptions and reliefs contained in Irish legislation. The intent of this definition is to ensure that all types of income will be included in determining a person's income for grant purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_5133">For the purposes of determining grant eligibility, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest-profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period. Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_5134">Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products, it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates. My Department is satisfied that the approach taken to computing reckonable income for purposes of determining eligibility under the maintenance grant schemes is appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_5147">Under my Department's higher education grant schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states, including the UK. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Tax relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_5148">In recent years, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also. All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students.</p>

          <p eId="para_5150">Very significant additional resources have been provided for the education of children who have special educational needs arising from disabilities. I acknowledge, however, that there was an historic deficit in funding such education resources and further progress is needed in the special education system before we can be satisfied that every child has access to the kind of education resources he or she needs and is entitled to. I am committed to making that progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_5151">I also acknowledge that, because of resourcing and organisational issues, there are parents who feel it necessary in the interests of their child to seek redress in the courts. That is their right. My Department responds to cases brought against the State, as it is obliged to do, and most are settled on agreed terms without a court hearing.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_254">Legal costs incurred by the State in defending those cases which are brought to court are not met directly by my Department. In accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State, costs are generally charged to the Chief State Solicitor's Office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General. My Department meets the legal costs of plaintiffs where there is a settlement or an order for costs against the State. In the past five years the following amounts have been expended for these purposes from the funds voted for special needs education: 1998, £40,300; 1999, £179,726; 2000, £198,775; 2001, £2,245,917; 2002, €4,034,778.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_255">Donabate-Portrane Educate Together national school was granted provisional recognition in September 2002. The school authorities were advised at that time that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_256">Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider purchasing a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_257">The school was made aware, on being granted recognition, that it was likely that a period of seven to ten years would elapse before permanent accommodation would be provided given the number of schools already awaiting permanent accommodation and that it would remain the patron's responsibility to provide interim accommodation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">As part of the recognition process the school's proposals for accommodating the school were examined and, in granting provisional recognition, the Department accepted in good faith that the school had arrangements in hand to accommodate the school's growing needs for five to six years. The patron and board of management were instructed to undertake to develop and implement an enrolment policy that would, among other things, provide for incremental growth that would be manageable without overcrowding within the capacity of available accommodation. The available accommodation may necessitate the school in any year having to restrict its intake.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_259">While it is the responsibility of the school authorities to locate suitable temporary accommodation, my Department assists by grant aiding reasonable rental costs. In relation to the proposal from the school authorities to enter negotiations with Fingal County Council, my Department has advised that it has no objection in principle to this proposal but naturally any proposal emanating from these discussions will have to offer value for money. There are also a number of technical considerations, including the implications for providing a permanent building at a later stage while a temporary school structure is located on the site. My officials did not write to Fingal County Council earlier due to the fact that the school authorities were exploring an alternative proposal until recently.</summary>

The GGB is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht treaty.

          <p eId="para_5256">Under the Fisheries Acts, the regional fisheries boards are responsible for issuing salmon fishing licences. All applications for such licences are considered in accordance with the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders 1980 to 1997. A person convicted of a fishing offence may, following the expiry period of any disqualification order issued by the courts, apply again for a commercial fishing licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_5257">The Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders set maximum numbers of licences which may be issued by the regional board in each fishery district. In allocating the licences, priority is first given to applications from persons who derived a substantial part of their livelihood from fishing for salmon under a licence issued in the previous year. Accordingly, a person failing to meet this criteria is accorded a lower priority which, given the maximum number of licences applicable, may result in the application being unsuccessful.</p>

The strategy for the sector, Growing for the Future, published in 1996, set a target of 20% for broadleaf planting. Under the CAP programme 1993-99, the level of broad leaf planting increased dramatically reaching 20% in 1997. The broad leaf planting rate in 2002 was 23%.</p>
          <p eId="para_5326">With regard to increasing the level of broad leaf planting the way ahead is outlined in the CAP rural development plan under which my Department is committed to reaching a planting level of 30% for broad leaf trees by the end of 2006. My Department is confident that this target will be achieved. As outlined in the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, progress is being recorded on a regular basis. In 2001 my Department launched the native woodland scheme and the neighbourhood scheme, both of which promote the planting of broad leaf trees.</p>

A national SARS freephone information line 1800 45 45 00 has been set up with effect from 28 April 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_287">Since the incubation period of SARS can be up to ten days, general registration or health controls such as screening, at ports of arrival in Ireland are of little value; on the contrary, they may give the public a false sense of security. This is in line with expert advice received from the World Health Organisation and the European Union's Communicable Disease Network Committee. Instead the WHO recommends that persons departing from an affected area should be screened prior to departure. In line with the national and international advice available, identification of individuals travelling from areas with recent local transmission is not considered necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_288">Protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describe the syndrome and provide advice on how suspect cases should be managed have been developed. The relevant guidelines and protocols have been circulated to medical practitioners. This material is reviewed and updated by the expert group and the most up to date information is also available on my Department's website (www.doh.ie). A large amount of other relevant information in relation to SARS has also been placed on that website including a frequently asked questions document which should help to inform the public and to address public concerns. This information is updated on an on-going basis.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_290">Following the publication of the report of the Joint Review Group on Psychological Services in the Health Services in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_291">Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_292">In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_293">Given these constraints my Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from end 1999 to end 2002, from 26 to 84, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. At present, there are about 105 clinical psychologists undertaking post-graduate training in the State. More than 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist post-graduate training diploma, 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD, with 12 in first year and 12 in second year and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD, with ten in second year and nine in third year. It is understood that both the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick have plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology in 2003 with an intake of a further 20 students in total. These developments, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_294">My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services as detailed in the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November, 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_295">A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support post-graduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is currently examining the current model for postgraduate psychology training, with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_296">With regard to the issue of vacancies nation-wide, the Deputy may wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 40% – an increase of 125 from 291 to 416 – over the three years to end-2002 in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service which has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided. The number of fully qualified psychologists employed in the Western Health Board area increased by 27% from 41 at the end of 1999 to 52 at the end of 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_297">Responsibility for the provision of psychology services and human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of psychologist posts, rests with the chief executive officer of each board. Each chief executive officer, in managing the workforce in his-her region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has this responsibility in the Western Health Board area and my Department has therefore asked her to investigate the matter regarding staff shortages and vacancies raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_298">In addition to measures to increase the supply of psychologists through the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review report, it should be recognised that other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of basic grade psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5445">The drugs payment scheme (DPS) replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes in 1999. It was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced following amendment of the relevant section of the Health Act 1970. However, amendment of the Act was delayed and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's Office in October 2000, regulations made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001. Given that, as has been pointed out previously, claimants derived greater overall benefits under the new scheme as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_5446">Following a review by my Department of the position on this issue, it was decided that a process should be put in place for assessing applications for refunds to people who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_5467">Healthy eating guidelines developed by the health promotion unit of my Department highlight that the diet of the Irish population should be based on fresh foods as far as possible. The demand for convenience foods such as ready-made meals is acknowledged but it is stressed that these foods are usually rich in salt and fat and should be used only occasionally. The health promotion unit of my Department uses the food pyramid as a tool for both adults and children to encourage the consumption of fresh unprocessed foods as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_5468">Over the past four years, 78 additional dieticians have been employed through the cardiovascular health strategy and work with people in the community to promote healthy eating. The health promotion unit of my Department, in collaboration with the community dieticians, in April 2003 published food and nutrition guidelines for primary schools which provide practical information on a healthy diet for children in these settings. Food and nutrition guidelines for pre-schools will be published in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_5469">The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, recognised the need to address the problem of increased salt intake in the population especially as salt intake is associated with raised blood pressure. In this regard my Department is working with a nutrition sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland regarding the action necessary to reduce the population's salt consumption and a position document is awaited. In the interim, the FSAI has identified the food groups that contribute the largest sodium content to the Irish diet, as determined from the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, North-South dietary survey. The next stage is to contact the manufacturers in particular food sectors, with the help of other stakeholders such as retailers, via the FSAI retail forum, and to identify the specific levels of salt and the likely reduction that can be achieved. This work will commence when the FSAI scientific committee issues its report on salt and health which is expected by the end of the year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_301">With regard to labelling of salt content, the position is that nutritional labelling information is voluntary unless a specific nutritional claim is made such as low salt or low fat. Thus, where a claim about low salt is included on the packaging, the manufacturer is required to list the sodium content. However, the EU has undertaken an evaluation of labelling legislation with a view to identifying current and future needs of consumers, regarding the labelling information necessary for reasons of health protection and to enable informed purchasing choices. Legislative proposals are expected in 2004. In the meantime the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the Food and Drink Federation, FDF, within the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, have been in discussion regarding the inclusion of salt labelling in a voluntary labelling code. I understand that a draft voluntary code is being drafted and is nearing completion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_302">I also note that work on salt reduction in processed foods has been carried out in the UK. This should have a knock on effect in British foods sold in Ireland, which, coupled with a similar salt reduction strategy in Ireland starting later in 2003 and agreement of explicit labelling of salt content in the FDF voluntary code, should see the consumer better informed and less exposed to high salt content of foods.</summary>

A range of measures are being taken in the health, justice and education sectors to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_5472">I understand from the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the incidence of children begging on the streets of the main cities is most prevalent in the Dublin area with infrequent incidents occurring in other cities and towns. Reported cases in cities and towns outside Dublin are dealt with by the social work departments of the health boards in liaison with the Garda, if appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_5473">The Leanbh annual report in 2001 indicated that there were approximately 40 families from which children were reported begging, with 1,322 sightings of children begging, in the Dublin Area. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has indicated that it has not been made aware of any increase on this level. I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the Garda authorities consider that the problem of child begging has decreased since the commencement of the Leanbh initiative.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_303">I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that most children who beg on the streets in Dublin are from the Traveller and Roma communities.

        <summary eId="sum_304">Social workers from the area health boards respond as appropriate to referrals received from the Leanbh service. Leanbh was set up specifically by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to work with children begging and their families. The Leanbh service liaises with the health boards, the Garda, schools and training centres. The Leanbh service comprises an outreach and street service and operates on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_305">Leanbh outreach workers monitor the presence of begging children and link these children with appropriate statutory services. The Leanbh service also carries out a broad-based assessment of the child's needs through contact with the child, the parent and the child and parent together. Following this assessment, an individual programme plan, based on the child's strengths, is prepared, and these needs are met through therapeutic intervention in the child's home/place of residence. The project is part-funded by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the order of €40,000 in the three year period 2001-03.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_306">There are also other legislative and policy developments which will contribute to preventing or addressing the child begging. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 is now fully commenced. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. Under the Act, the National Education Welfare Board has been established as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The board recently advertised for the recruitment of additional staff. These staff will work in close co-operation with schools, teachers, parents and community/voluntary bodies with a view to encouraging regular school attendance and developing strategies to reduce absenteeism and early school leaving.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_307">The Children Act 2001, introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, updates the law in relation to child begging. The provisions of the Act will make it an offence for a child to be allowed or induced by an adult to beg in any street or public place or to make house to house calls for the purpose of begging or receiving alms. The Act puts the onus on the parents or guardians of the child to prove that they did not send the child out to beg. Under the Act, the penalty for allowing a child to beg has been increased from a maximum of €31.74 to a maximum of €317.43 for a first offence and €634.87 for any subsequent offence.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5485">A multi-agency investigation, co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was carried out into health problems at Askeaton. The investigation involved a number of human health studies to determine if the health of people living in the area was different to that of residents in surrounding counties and, if so, whether the difference could be attributed to environmental pollution. The results of this investigation did not establish a link to any form of local environmental pollution: it did not find a significant degree of excessive ill health in the Askeaton area and it concluded that there was little basis for the concern that any problems in the area represented a threat to human health.</p>
          <p eId="para_5486">A further study carried out by the National Cancer Registry examined cancer data relating to the Askeaton area covering the period 1994-99. The results of this study indicates that cancer rates in the Mid-Western Health Board area from 1994-99 were lower than the national average and that cancer rates in the Askeaton study areas 1 and 2 from 1994-99 were lower than the Mid-Western Health Board average and conformed to national and regional patterns by cause. The data as examined by the National Cancer Registry do not support the hypothesis that the incidence of cancer in the Askeaton region is higher than would be expected based on either Mid-Western Health Board or national cancer incidence rates. Against this background I have no plans to initiate a public inquiry in relation to this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_5718">When Government decides to establish a tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation under the aegis of my Department, I consult the Attorney General in relation to the selection of suitably qualified persons who are available to act as chairpersons or members of the legal teams attached to such inquiries. The terms and conditions of appointment of these persons are subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5719">The amounts paid to date since 1997 to the inquiries under my aegis are set as follows. The post-mortem inquiry established by Government decision of 4 April 2000 and chaired by Ms Anne Dunne SC has incurred costs of €6.7 million to May 2003. The tribunal of inquiry into the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia, chaired by Judge Alison Lindsay, has cost €13 million to May 2003. This is only in respect of the tribunal's own costs, the costs of the State's legal team and the costs of one party. The Taxing Master has recently concluded hearing a claim for some €17 million submitted by legal advisers for the Irish Haemophilia Society and has reserved his judgment. Around 26 other bills of costs from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, the National Haemophilia Centre, The Irish Medicines Board, hospitals, health boards and individual consultants, have yet to be processed. The final cost is expected to be in the region of €40 million. The proposed inquiry into the abuse of children by priests in the Diocese of Ferns was an investigation was conducted by Mr. George Bermingham, SC, to ascertain the best way of holding a full inquiry. The cost of this investigation was €424,738. The inquiry into the handling of allegations of child sexual abuse in the Diocese of Ferns was established on foot of the recommendations of the investigation conducted by George Bermingham. It was formally announced in March and no costs have been incurred to date. Details on the names of the legal teams for each inquiry and the amount paid to individuals to date are being processed and will be forwarded to the Deputy as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_5731">Student nurse education is provided in partnership between higher education institutes and health agencies. In the case of University College Cork, the partnership is with the Southern Health Board. The pre-registration nursing degree requires clinical placements as an integral part of the programme. The clinical placement of the students is arranged by University College Cork in hospitals and other health care centres within the Southern Health Board, the voluntary hospitals and other services in the region. While the clinical placement takes place in health agencies, the student is registered with the higher education institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_5732">As part of the preparation for the clinical placement, students are required to undergo a health assessment process. This process is similar to that which is required for all staff and students who have clinical contact with patients. The measures are taken to ensure the protection of staff, students and patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_5733">In the case of the student concerned, she attended with colleagues at the occupational health department of Cork University Hospital on 10 December 2002. At that meeting she indicated that she did not wish to proceed further with the vaccination-screening programme. She was invited back to the Department to discuss the issue further, but did not respond to any of the Department's letters. She was written to on 20 December 2002 and 31 January 2003. Telephone messages were left for her on 15 January 2003 and 22 January 2003. Following further discussions with nurse management and the occupational health department at Cork University Hospital, and with the head of the department of nursing studies of University College Cork, it was decided to write to the student again.</p>
          <p eId="para_5734">The personnel officer of the Southern Health Board wrote to her on 28 May 2003. In his letter he indicated that it was regretted that, unless she met the requirements outlined on behalf of the board by the occupational physician, it would not be in a position to facilitate her clinical placement commencing on Wednesday, 4 June 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_315">The student made an appointment and visited the occupational physician on Thursday, 29 May 2003. At that meeting she confirmed that she did not wish to undertake the procedures. The matter was again discussed between the health board and the university.

        <summary eId="sum_316">The university confirms that the students in the first year of the BSc nursing degree have not yet completed the first year of the programme.

      the law regarding speeding fines by fixed cameras; if there is a period of time within which the notice must issue in order for the fine to be valid; if penalty points occur in such cases; if so, the number of penalty points which occur; the relevant date from which they occur; and the length of time they last on the person's licence before being lifted.

          <p eId="para_5736">The detection of speeding offences can be made by the direct intercept of a motorist by a member of the Garda Síochána who shall then serve on that person, or cause to be served, personally or by post, a notice of the offence alleged. The detection of a speeding offence can also be made by means of electronic or other apparatus, including cameras, and in that instance a notice of the offence alleged is served on the registered owner of the mechanically propelled vehicle concerned. There is no statutory period of time within which the gardaí must issue this fixed charge notice in either instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5737">Where the registered owner makes a declaration that he or she was not driving or otherwise using the vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence alleged, he or she must within 28 days give or send a document to the gardaí supplying information, including the name and address of the person who was. In those instances the Road Traffic Act 2002 provides that the gardaí must, not later than 28 days after such document is given or sent, serve a notice on the person named by the registered owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_5738">Penalty points for speeding have been operating since 31 October 2002. Four penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted in court of speeding offences and two penalty points to those who opt to pay a fixed charge within a 56 day period to the gardaí to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_317">The Road Traffic Act 2002 contains a number of provisions to ensure the effective application of penalty points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed in a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5. The application of penalty points from the date of the alleged commission of an offence would not be appropriate in that the points would apply from a date that would precede either the payment of a fixed charge or the determination of guilt by a court. Penalty points remain on a person's driving licence record for a period of three years from the operative date.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5751">Responsibility for the operation of rail services, including the rolling stock to be used and development of infrastructure is a day-to-day matter for Irish Rail. However, I understand that Irish Rail is currently taking delivery of 80 new diesel rail cars for use on the Cork-Cobh Line and on Dublin commuter lines. To date, 24 of these units have been delivered and are currently undergoing commissioning. Irish Rail expects that all units will be delivered by September and in service by year-end. Four of these will be used for the Cork-Cobh commuter service and will be in service before end 2003. This will mean an increase in capacity of 120% and more frequent services on the line.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_322">Irish Rail has recently placed an order for 67 new mainline carriages. These carriages will be used primarily on the Cork-Dublin line and will allow a cascade of rolling stock onto other services and allow Irish Rail to replace older carriages within its fleet. The increased operational flexibility associated with the new rolling stock will allow an increase in frequency with one additional service each way between Dublin and Cork and an additional service each way between Galway and Dublin.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_323">Irish Rail has been investing in infrastructure on all routes, including Dublin-Cork, as part of the 1999-2003 safety programme. This work is currently ongoing.

          <p eId="para_5819">In 1998 the gardaí introduced a vehicle stopping device as a counter-crime measure for use by qualified garda personnel countrywide. After much research, training was provided in accordance with the revised training programme implemented by the London Metropolitan Police.</p>
          <p eId="para_5820">This device, which is known as the "stinger", is a compact lightweight tyre deflator consisting of a plastic mat fitted with 40 millimetre spikes. It is user-friendly and ensures a controlled deflation of tyres. Use of this device is limited to members who have received instruction in its operation and are competent in its use and maintenance.</p>
          <p eId="para_5821">Each operational Garda division has its own suitably qualified instructors training personnel in the use of this equipment. To assist with this training a presentation pack consisting of a CDROM, Powerpoint presentation and a video were developed by the gardaí and are on issue to each Garda division.</p>
          <p eId="para_5822">The gardaí will always attempt to find the best vehicle having regard to the safety of its members and the general public and the ability to perform the duties to which the vehicle is assigned. Many of the vehicles currently being purchased have safety systems that are an integral part of the vehicle design and are among the safest in their class. New models of vehicles are constantly tested and assessed for suitability for use by gardaí and the safety of members and the general public will always be of paramount importance.</p>

      [16417/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_917">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_5824">All prisoners are provided with access to health care services while in custody. It is policy to seek to provide health services to prisoners of a standard broadly equivalent to that available to persons in the general community covered by the public health system. In as much as possible, primary care – medical, dental – is provided within prison establishments. Where, on the basis of medical assessment, a prisoner is considered to require specialist hospital assessment or treatment, arrangements are made for this through the prison. Such specialist facilities are accessed on the basis that prisoners are treated as public patients. Related health care services such as access to chiropody, optical, etc., services are provided where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_5825">Arising from long-standing difficulties in relation to the recruitment and retention of health care staff to work with prisoners, a group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services was established in 1999. The report of this group, which was published in 2001, makes a total of 43 recommendations covering various aspects of prison health care including GP, nursing, pharmacy, dental, and psychiatry services. Arising from the publication of this report, a prison health working group comprising representatives from both the Irish Prison Service – Healthcare Directorate – and health boards together with representatives from both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform was established. This group, under the chair of Mr. Pat McLoughlin, chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board, has met on a number of occasions with a view to seeking to implement the agreed recommendations of the report. In particular, it is considered desirable to seek to integrate prison based health care services with those services based in surrounding communities in as much as possible and the working group is exploring means of achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_5826">All primary care prison doctors are required to be fully registered with the Irish Medical Council. They are employed under a common contract agreed between the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, Irish Prison Service and the Irish Medical Organisation, representing the doctors. A small number of doctors are full-time while most provide services on a part-time basis. At present the midlands prison in Portlaoise is serviced by two full-time doctors. Cloverhill Prison is serviced by one full-time, currently vacant, and two part-time doctors. All other prisons are serviced on a part-time basis with the notional allocation of hours dependent on the nature and size of the particular prison population. The part-time position in Portlaoise Prison has been vacant for some time due to problems in filling this post. This position is currently being filled on a locum basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_5827">The number of doctors by institution is as follows:</p>

      asked the

      the number of prisoners who have died from a fatal heroin overdose while in custody each year since 1992 for each prison in the State.

          <p eId="para_5923">All deaths in custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a coroner's court. The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the court. The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by the prison authorities and the suicide awareness group in each institution. These examinations cover fully the background and circumstances of each death. Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_5924">I attach figures for the deaths in prison custody since 1992 in the instances where the Coroner's Court verdict indicated that heroin was either the sole cause of death or a major contributing factor. Inquests by a coroner have not been held, to date, in respect of all the deaths in custody in 2003. However, where the examination by the prison authorities indicate that heroin may have been a contributing factor in the death I have included these deaths in custody in the following table.</p>

          <p eId="para_5953">The person arrived in the State on the 23 April 2001 as an unaccompanied minor and claimed asylum on the 2 May 2001. Following interview and examination of his case the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner advised the applicant, by letter dated 2 October 2002, that it was recommending that he not be declared a refugee. The person submitted an appeal against this decision to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_5954">On 30 April 2003 the Refugee Appeals Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and by letter dated 30 May 2003 the person's application was formally refused by the ministerial decisions unit. That letter set out the options open to him at that point: to leave the State before the decision had been made whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of him; to consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him; or to make written representations setting out reasons as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_334">Any representations received will be considered in the context of the person's case being examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, to decide whether or not a deportation order should be made in respect of him. It should be noted that the person concerned recently reached his eighteenth birthday and is no longer a minor.</summary>

She gave birth to an Irish citizen child in October 2001. Thereupon she withdrew her application for asylum and applied for residency on the basis of her child. This application was granted in January 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_5972">Visas were granted to two of her children aged four and 12 in September 2002 to enable them join her in Ireland. Subsequently applications were made for two other sons – one a minor aged 16 and one an adult aged 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_5973">Her partner, whose whereabouts was unknown to her at the time of the original asylum application, arrived in the State in March 2002. He was in possession of forged travel documentation which, according to information on file, had been arranged for him in Ireland. He gained entry to the State on foot of a claim for asylum but withdrew that subsequently and applied for residency on the basis of his parentage of the aforementioned Irish citizen child. He married his partner in the State on 14 August 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_5974">Following the Supreme Court judgment of 23 January 2003, which found that the Minister was entitled to deport persons who are the parents of Irish born children, no further processing is taking place on applications for residency on the basis of being the parent of an Irish born child, or applications from family members of persons who have residency on the basis of being the parent of an Irish born child, pending implementation of a new policy framed in the light of a Government decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_5976">The courts have identified the duty of the Executive to protect the common good by the exercise of controls on the entry, residence and removal of non-nationals. As part of this general obligation, and in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, deportation orders are made in respect of persons who are found illegally in the State or who no longer have a legal basis for their stay in the State. Among the categories of persons against whom deportation orders may be made are those who, having secured a temporary stay in the State for the purpose of having a claim for asylum examined, turn out after independent investigation of the claim not to be refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_5977">The fact that a person who has made an unfounded claim for the protection of the State and has no right to be in the State belongs to a category of persons who may at some time in the future acquire, generally, such a right does not of itself justify setting aside the responsibility of the Executive to require such persons to leave the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_5982">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the decision to issue identification letters and numbers to each member of the Garda Síochána is a recent one. Historically, identification letters and numbers were only issued to gardaí in the Dublin Metropolitan and Cork city areas. In 2002, following concern from members of the public about their inability to identify members of the Garda Síochána with whom they came into contact, the Garda Commissioner undertook a review of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_5983">As a result of this review a direction was issued by the Commissioner in July 2002 that all uniformed members of the Garda Síochána would wear identification numbers and letters on their shoulders on duty so that they would be readily identified by members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_5984">In deciding the manner in which this policy decision would be implemented it was seen as essential that lettering and numbers would be easily identifiable and recognisable. To avoid confusion and ambiguity it was decided that each of the 26 Garda divisions rather than the 108 Garda districts would have its own individual distinctive lettering and numbering for the sole use of members of that division. In this manner while the numerals would be similar in each division the lettering would clearly define the division in which the member was serving, thus making the members of the Garda Síochána readily identifiable even when working with members of the Garda Síochána from other Garda divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_5985">If this process were to be adopted in respect of Garda districts there would be, in the view of the Garda authorities, significant confusion for members of the public in areas where the town name of two or more district headquarters within the division began with the same letter. This confusion would be greatly increased when every district in the country is considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_5986">In respect of the Galway West division only part of this division is a Gaeltacht area. In line with the decision to issue lettering and numerals on a divisional basis, the Garda authorities believe that it would be impractical and logistically very difficult to have two different sets of numbers for the division, i.e. G.W. for non-Gaeltacht areas and G.T. for Gaeltacht areas. Dual lettering and numbering in divisions would also cause confusion to the general public.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_339">If this procedure were adopted in the Galway West division similar procedures would, presumably, have to be put in place for the other Gaeltacht areas of the country, namely, Louth-Meath, Kerry, Cork West, Donegal and Kilkenny-Waterford. In some circumstances the Gaeltacht areas in these divisions are only policed from stations or substations. The introduction of numbering for these areas would require numbering and lettering to be introduced on a station by station basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_340">The introduction of numbering and lettering on a district basis to cater for the distinctive nature of an area would therefore be difficult to design and administer. The use of additional letters throughout the various Garda divisions would also result in greater confusion in the identification of Garda members by the public and would negate the purpose for which lettering and numerals are supplied in the first place when the variety and number of different forms of lettering and numbering are taken into account.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_341">The use of lettering on members' shoulders is, as previously stated, designed to make members of the Garda Síochána on duty readily identifiable to members of the public at all times. It will not in any way interfere with the continuation of the use of the Irish language for official correspondence or any Garda business in Gaeltacht areas.</summary>

The person did not attend as required and was classified as an evader. He was subsequently arrested and deported from the State on 3 May 2002.

It is my intention that the new coroners legislation would remove the restriction limiting to a maximum of two the number of medical witnesses a coroner may summon to give evidence. The current sanction contained in section 37 of the Coroners Act 1962 which may be imposed on a witness who fails to attend at an inquest is £5 (€6.35 equivalent).

          <p eId="para_6003">The purpose of the Race Directive (2000/43/EC) is to provide a flexible general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in both the employment and non-employment areas. The Directive must be implemented by 19 July 2003. Discrimination in relation to employment and in the supply of goods and services on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race (which includes race, colour, nationality, or ethnic or national origins) and membership of the Traveller community is already prohibited in Ireland following commencement of the Employment Equality Act 1998 on 18 October 1999 and the Equal Status Act 2000 on 25 October 2000.</p>

Furthermore, implementation of the directives necessitates amendments to legislation to provide for equality in relation to occupational pensions which will be dealt with by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the Social Welfare Bill 2004. The text of the Employment Equality and Equal Status (Amendment) Bill is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6005">On 9 March 2002, the Government extended the terms of reference of the Liquor Licensing Commission, already engaged in a review of the liquor licensing code, to allow it to examine the rights of licence holders to refuse admission and service in licensed premises and to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes. This decision was made in the light of controversy concerning the State's discrimination and licensing codes.</p>
          <p eId="para_6006">The Commission on Liquor Licensing submitted its report on admission and service in licensed premises in December 2002. As regards equality matters, the report contained a number of options for legislative change, one of which was the transfer of jurisdiction from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court, but no formal recommendation.</p>

The Equality Authority is to be given a new role in referring cases to the court and in providing assistance to those seeking redress. The type of redress for victims of discrimination is to be strengthened to include temporary closure of the premises and it is also intended that objections to the renewal of licences of premises found to have engaged in discrimination may be considered by the court with a view to revoking licences if necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_349">No reduction in legal protection in relation to discrimination will arise from the proposed change. I am satisfied that there is general public acceptance that a single venue should deal with all admission issues on licensed premises.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6091">My Department has had no communication from Waterford City Council concerning a proposed boundary extension. However, I understand that action is being taken by the city council at local level to initiate the formulation of a boundary proposal. Under the statutory provisions at present in force, any proposed boundary extension would require the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and it would be inappropriate therefore for me to make any statement in the matter.</p>

However, a grant may be allowed where the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or a deed or separation, and the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship. Each such application is considered on its merits. In this particular case, my Department is awaiting additional information requested from the applicant.</p>

          <p eId="para_6101">The following tables list 97 areas proposed for designation as special areas of conservation, including three areas that overlap both counties, located wholly or partly in counties Galway and Roscommon. Some 85 of these sites have already been formally transmitted for assessment on a candidate list to the European Commission; a consultation process with landowners is currently pending in relation to the remainder. All these areas have been proposed for designation in order to secure the favourable conservation status of ecologically important habitats and species, in accordance with criteria set out in the EU Habitats Directive and in the European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations 1997. Important habitats represented in Counties Roscommon and Galway include raised bogs, turloughs, sand dunes, machair as well as rivers and estuaries.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_6840">Local authorities indicated to my Department that they would require some €1 billion to meet what they estimated to be their funding requirements this year for their housing construction programmes. My Department considers that this overstates requirements for the current year, and the total amount of capital funding available this year to allocate to local authorities for their housing construction programmes was €700 million. While it follows that most local authorities did not receive the full amount requested by them, I am nonetheless confident that substantial progress on local authority housing programmes is being supported by these allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_6841">Each local authority has been allocated a number of housing starts which they can construct over the years 2000 to 2004 under the four year multi-annual housing construction programme designed to provide 25,000 housing starts during the period. The principal reason for the introduction of a four year multi-annual approach, which replaced the annual allocation of starts, was to allow local authorities more scope to plan the implementation of their housing programmes. Having regard to the general Exchequer financial position, progress to the end of 2002 in the delivery of the four year programme of starts is satisfactory with some 16,300 starts achieved during the three year period 2000 to 2003.</p>

An essential element of Civil Service policy for dealing with such cases is a recognition that a complaint is no more than an allegation unless and until the facts have been satisfactorily established by the investigation and until a conclusion has been reached by the investigator.</p>

In the case of group schemes that depend on quality-deficient private sources, a 100% capital grant is available for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment. Associated civil works qualify for an 85% grant. An annual subsidy towards the cost of supplying domestic water is also payable to group water schemes. There are no proposals at present to review the grant or subsidy schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_6854">Group sewerage schemes may qualify for a grant of up to 75% of the approved cost, subject to a maximum grant of €2,031.58 per house. In response to the recommendations of the national rural water monitoring committee, my Department is funding a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small-scale waste water collection and treatment systems, based on design-build-operate procurement, as a means of meeting the requirements of small rural communities. Subject to a satisfactory outcome of the pilot testing, the committee envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic waste water from households outside the immediate catchment area of the new treatment systems. Any review of the associated grants must await the outcome of the pilot programme.</p>

Those disqualified include members of the Garda Síochána, permanent members of the Defence Forces and civil servants who are not by terms of employment expressly permitted to be a member of a local authority. Under existing arrangements, local authority employees above grade 3 level are ineligible for membership of their own or an adjoining local authority. It is intended that this exclusion will be extended to apply to all local authorities at the next local elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_6860">Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock, including addressing any problems arising on their housing estates from serious anti-social behaviour. The primary purpose of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 is to provide for a range of measures to assist housing authorities in this regard. One of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the local authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against an individual member of the household who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_6861">Apart from collecting, on an annual basis in arrears, some general statistics on the operation of the Act, my Department would have no information on the day-to-day use of the provisions of the Act by local authorities. My Department is aware, however, of a number of instances where applications brought by tenants in a particular local authority area have been denied by the courts. I understand the local authority concerned is considering the position, including the possibility of using the power in the 1997 Act to bring applications directly to the courts itself.</p>

      the progress in the achievement of an overall plan for waste management; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_971">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_6902">Government policy on waste management is set out in the policy documents Changing our Ways and Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change. The Government's approach is based on the internationally recognised waste management hierarchy of prevention-minimisation, significantly increased levels of recycling, energy recovery and, finally, utilising landfill as the last resort for residual waste that cannot otherwise be recovered.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_379">Local authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which, at a regional level, appear to offer the best balance between maximised recovery of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions, at reasonable cost. Local authorities then prepared and adopted waste management plans which require a major reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. A comprehensive regulatory framework has been put in place to assist them in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_380">The Government has made significant progress in the implementation of its overall plan for waste management. The most significant developments are as follows. Since November 2002 I have allocated over €22 million to some 71 local authority recycling projects under the waste infrastructure capital grants scheme. These include the provision of additional bring banks and modern civic amenity sites. I will be making further allocations later this year; segregated domestic collection services have now been provided in a number of major urban centres. The service now covers around one third of all households in the State. Repak, having reported that Ireland met its EU target of recovering 25% of packaging waste in 2001, continued to report progress towards meeting the 2005 50% target. I introduced new packaging regulations in February last which place obligations on producers of packaging to recover packaging waste. Almost 45,000 composting units have been provided to householders around the country at subsidised rates in recent years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_381">The National Construction and Demolition Waste Council was established in June 2002. This council, a voluntary initiative by the construction industry, has as its objective the securing of a significant increase in the recycling of construction and demolition waste. Other producer responsibility initiatives are being progressed, including in relation to end-of-life vehicles, newsprint and tyres. I established a scheme for the management of waste fridges and freezers on the island of Ireland with the provision of funding to local authorities to dispose of old fridges and freezers at a fridge recycling facility in Downpatrick, County Down. The plastic bag levy was introduced in March 2002 and has had a dramatic impact on consumption of disposable plastic bags. It is a valuable initiative in raising awareness of litter and waste management initiatives generally and is widely supported by the public. A levy of €15 per tonne of waste disposed to landfill came into effect in June 2002. The proceeds, which like the plastic bag levy, are payable into a new environment fund, will drive a variety of waste management and other environmental initiatives.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_382">We have also made significant progress in waste legislation, facilitating more effective management and control. The measures involved include: the coming into effect of the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2001 which facilitate better control of waste movements; the Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2002, which prohibit the landfilling of liquid waste and certain hazardous and infectious wastes in new landfills from July 2001, in hazardous landfills from July 2002 and in all landfills from July 2009. The regulations also prohibit the landfilling of whole tyres in new, or hazardous, landfill facilities from July 2003, and of shredded tyres from July 2006. These dates are extended to July 2009 in the case of existing landfill facilities; the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 which impose obligations on producers who supply packaging to the Irish market, that is, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers, to segregate specified packaging waste materials arising on their premises and to have it collected by authorised waste operators for recycling. The specified packaging materials that must now be recycled are glass, paper, fibreboard, steel, aluminium, plastic sheeting and wood.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_383">In addition, the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 contains a number of significant provisions to strengthen the enforcement powers of local authorities and the EPA in the waste management area. Progress towards meeting the targets set out in Changing our Ways will be reported by the EPA which is responsible for the provision of statistics on waste management generally. The national waste database report for 1998, published by the EPA in March 2000, is the most recent report available. The report provides detailed statistics on waste streams in Ireland including details on the recovery of waste. The next national waste database report for 2001 will be published by the EPA within the coming weeks.</summary>

In operating the scheme, local authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining the maximum house price limit or any other details they deem appropriate. I consider that these issues are best determined by individual local authorities. Under the shared ownership scheme, Kildare County Council completed 89 transactions and issued 186 approvals in principle during 2002, which ranks the council the fourth highest in the overall level of activity throughout the country.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_386">At the beginning of the current national development plan, compliance with the year 2005 requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive stood at 25%.

Full compliance by the end of 2005 is the target and the funding being provided for the advancement of relevant schemes approved under my Department's water services investment programme will ensure that this is achieved. The national development plan provides for expenditure of €4.4 billion over the period 2000-06 on water services infrastructure, of which some €2.4 billion will be spent on waste water facilities.

        <summary eId="sum_388">My Department operates a number of measures providing assistance towards the cost of conserving our architectural heritage. Some €6 million is being made available this year from public funds for the conservation of relevant structures. Annual allocations for conservation grant schemes are determined having regard to the wider budgetary position. My Department will continue to monitor the operation and effectiveness of these schemes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6917">The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for investment of € 2.43 billion in non-national roads over the period of the plan –€1.08 billion in the BMW region and €1.35 billion in the SE region. Expenditure in both regions was well ahead of that profiled for the period 2000-02. Total expenditure over this period was €1.171 billion – almost 13% ahead of the profile of €1.038 billion. In the BMW region actual expenditure was nearly €494 million against a profile of just under €458 million and in the SE region expenditure was over €677 million compared to the profile of €580 million for that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_6918">The non-national roads measure is one of the best performing measures under both the SE and BMW regional operational Programmes. In 2003, €434 million is available for non-national roads which compares to the 2003 NDP profile of just under €372 million. The 2003 provision will ensure the continuation of the record level of investment in non-national roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_6920">If the subject matter, arising from the terms of reference, of a tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation is materially relevant and substantially impacts upon the functions, statutory or otherwise, of the Department, the Minister, in consultation with the Attorney General, will decide whether he should make an application to the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation for grant of legal representation before the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation. If, by virtue of the terms of reference of the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation, the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation determines that the Minister should be legally represented at the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation, then a legal team or representation on behalf of the Minister will attend, either on a limited or non-limited basis at the hearings of the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation. Such attendance is subject to the terms of the grant of representation from the tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation in respect of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_6921">The selection and appointment of the legal team or representatives to a tribunal, inquiry or other public committee of investigation on behalf of the Minister is conducted by the Attorney General in consultation with the Department. The Attorney General will identify and nominate members of the legal team, including counsel if necessary. Such legal representation is paid for by the Department at rates of remuneration sanctioned by the Department and the Department of Finance in consultation with, and pursuant to, the recommendations of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_6922">Counsel who are appointed to a tribunal or non-statutory inquiry to represent the tribunal or non-statutory inquiry itself are usually selected and appointed by the chairman of the tribunal or non-statutory inquiry in consultation with the Attorney General. Counsel who advise or represent parliamentary committee inquiries are usually selected and appointed by the parliamentary committee itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_7005">As I have stated in this House on a number of occasions, there has been a significant decline in interest in the student summer jobs scheme due to the availability of alternative well-paid summer employment in recent years.

However, I have asked the area partnerships to consider how best they can offer practical assistance and support to students from disadvantaged areas in finding temporary summer employment in the labour market. My Department is in contact with the partnerships and keeping the matter under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_7013">The living alone allowance which was introduced in 1977 is an additional payment, currently, of €7.70 per week, made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to those under 66 years of age receiving payments under a number of invalidity type schemes. The allowance was last increased in 1996. The policy on support for older people has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates for all pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_7014">The improvements announced in Budget 2003 saw the old age (contributory) pension increase to €157.30 per week and the old age (non-contributory) pension increase to €144.00 per week. The equivalent rates in 1997 were €99.04 and €85.71,respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_7015">Other improvements made in the area of pensions include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments. There have also been significant improvements in the free schemes. It will be my priority to ensure that available resources are used effectively in directing support to categories of people who are in the greatest need and the particular needs of pensioners will be taken into account in that context.</p>

          <p eId="para_7024">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments is providing for their heating needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_7025">To qualify for a fuel allowance an applicant must satisfy a means test. In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, a person may have a combined household income of up to €50.79 per week or savings-investments of up to €41,901.35 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance. Means in excess of this amount, including money received from the sale of property, are assessed for the purposes of the fuel allowance. Improvements have been made to the fuel allowance scheme in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_7026">The increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also significantly improved in real terms the income position for people in receipt of social welfare payments. In that context the income limit for entitlement to fuel allowance is a reasonable one. I would also point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. Many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances. In addition there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_7027">In the case in question, the person concerned does not qualify for fuel allowance as his income is above the prescribed limit. He is in receipt of an old age contributory pension and the Department's records indicate that he also has a private pension of more than €56 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_7028">The question of changes in the means test is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</p>
