#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	1	The delay in taking decisive decisions by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on a second runway at Dublin Airport has reached farcical levels. We know Deputy Shane Ross is no expert in transport matters. We all remember the 2010 article he wrote declaring that terminal 2 was a "white elephant, destined to be the most underused terminal in Europe". How wrong he was. It is a quotation Boris Johnson would have been proud of in its predictability, inaccuracy, etc. Boris Johnson had to go to Afghanistan in a hastily arranged trip to deal with his own runway problems at Heathrow Airport. I wonder where the Taoiseach plans to send the Minister. He has failed to advance legislation that is critical to the runway project, in particular, regarding the appointment of a noise regulator and the transposition of an EU directive that would enable Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to appeal planning restrictions on the project which make no sense given the enormous growth at Dublin Airport. Last April, the chief executive officer, Mr. Dalton Philips, signalled his deep alarm at Government delays overshadowing the project. He said the delay in bringing forward the legislation could be catastrophic and impact significantly on employment. Dublin Airport has positioned itself as a global hub, yet the existing conditions attached to this planning permission would restrict the entire airport to 65 aircraft movements. It currently facilitates twice that number with one runway.The Minister promised this legislation 22 months ago and designated the Irish Aviation Authority as the noise regulator. He got that wrong, as well as getting wrong the necessity for legislation by thinking a statutory instrument would do. The authority had started recruiting specialised staff but he had to reverse that and has now designated Fingal County Council as the noise regulator to deal with these legacy issues. This is a critical piece of infrastructure with an enormous impact on the Irish economy that indirectly supports 97,000 jobs. Why the delay? Why the mess-up? The Minister has messed up and he has delayed both the nomination of a noise regulator and the initiation of legislation. What is the Minister, Deputy Ross, doing with the most critical piece of infrastructure before his Department? The Government has known about this since 2014 and there has been no action. Why is the Minister so indecisive on this issue? Why has he been so ill informed? Why has he failed to do the groundwork on all these issues? When can we finally expect the legislation to be published and passed in order that this project can get under way?

The Government is 100% behind the DAA and its plans for a new parallel runway, the new north runway, at Dublin Airport. The project is contained in Project Ireland 2040, in black and white for anyone who needs to know where the Government stands on it. I would encourage the DAA to get started on building the runway. There is a Government decision supporting its efforts to do so and the legislation will be through these Houses and done and dusted long before the runway gets built. The legislation will allow Fingal County Council to become the noise regulator for the airport and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport intends to bring the legislation before the House after the summer, which will give effect to the new regime, but there is no reason work on the runway cannot begin. Dublin Airport is Ireland's gateway to the world. It takes approximately 30 million passenger movements every year and in the past decade has begun to provide direct flights to China, the Middle East, the west coast and Africa. It receives no taxpayers' money whatsoever and turns a profit, out of which it pays a substantial dividend to the taxpayer. It is also a very large employer in north and west Dublin. It is also important to acknowledge the role of our other airports, which are important to our aviation policy. In Shannon Airport, for example, which has now been separated from the DAA, passenger numbers are up by 25% since separation and it is making a profit again. It has very exciting plans to develop its avionics and aviation services industry, of which the Government is also very supportive. We are working very closely with Ireland West Airport, Knock, to advance its plans for further developments and we are in discussions with the European Commission on being allowed to give 90% grant aid for the airport's capital developments. Cork Airport has been increasing connectivity and is very important, as are the airports in Kerry and Donegal which have public service obligations, PSOs, from the Government to keep them going. That will continue as it provides access to counties that are not served properly by the motorway network. We are supporting Waterford Airport as best we can, though it does not have any flights any more. However, we think it is important that it is assisted in its efforts to encourage carriers to operate again between the south east and England. 
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	3	I asked the Taoiseach specifically about Dublin Airport and about the performance of the Minister, Deputy Ross. If the Government was 100% behind the DAA plans, the legislation would have been passed by now. The Government has known about this for many years. The Minister got the wrong nominating body, no homework was done and there was no attention to detail. It is shocking in many ways, given the enormous importance of Dublin Airport not just to the Dublin economy but to the national economy. I asked the Taoiseach to explain the delays and why the Minister has been so indecisive. He has a track record with DAA, going back to the articles which I mentioned earlier and I hope that does not inform his position.Will the Taoiseach confirm whether he has met Fingal County Council officials on this? They will require significant resourcing of expertise to enable them to fulfil the functions that will be outlined for them in the legislation that he wishes to pass. His lack of engagement on this issue for so long, which is possibly the most important issue on his desk for the past number of years, is striking. He is an expert on judges, Garda stations and the portfolios of other Ministers but the portfolio on which he is least decisive and proactive is his own, and it is critical to the economy and its future.

I also give a special welcome to Mr. Paddy Agnew, a former Deputy for Louth, who is in the Public Gallery. He was elected to the Dáil 37 years ago on an anti H-Blocks ticket. This is the first time he has been in Leinster House. I am sure everybody will extend a warm welcome to him. We are delighted he is here. It took him a while but he got here in the end. It has been confirmed that in the first financial report of the year released by the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, HSE, recorded a deficit of more than €100 million in January and February of this year. Based on that trend, it is likely that the half-year deficit will fall somewhere between €220 million and €300 million and it might be double that for the year as a whole. It is against that backdrop that I want to raise the scandalous spending on agency staff in our health service. Figures released to my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, show that every day in 2017 the HSE spent more than €800,000 on agency doctors, nurses and other staff to fill positions that have been left vacant. That is close to €300 million for the year as a whole. That is, as the Taoiseach will agree, a colossal amount to spend on the hiring of temporary staff, which is always more expensive than directly employing personnel. It is a big strain on the health budget.  When we look at the roles temporary staff are filling, the extent of the problem becomes apparent. A total of €105 million spent on hiring agency doctors and dentists and that figure has doubled since Fine Gael came into office in 2011. Some hospitals' dependency on agency staff is mind-boggling. Letterkenny University Hospital spent more than €9 million on agency doctors, Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise spent €8 million and University Hospital Limerick spent more than €5 million.There is also a severe crisis in nursing. More than €64 million has been spent on hiring agency nursing staff. There is no doubt that these staff perform a necessary function but the reason hospitals are reduced to relying on such costly agency staff is that the Government and the HSE have failed to address the recruitment and retention crisis. Health staff and the unions have consistently reported working conditions, facilities, supports, training opportunities and pay as the causes of the crisis and until these issues are addressed, we will continue to squander large amounts of public moneys in the way I have described. This is bad for workers. It is certainly bad for patients because it compromises continuity of care.  In April a Sinn Féin motion was passed in the Dáil which called for the introduction of recruitment and retention measures based on realistic proposals and which prioritised pay. It called on the Government to work with the unions to draw up a roadmap to full pay equality. Having done nothing thus far, will the Government now commit to acting on that motion in order that our nurses and other health professionals get a fair deal and we can end this ridiculous and excessive use of public money in the health service?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	22	The HSE is overrunning its budget once again, as has been the case in almost every year that I have been in the Dáil, which is ten or 11 years at this stage. That is notwithstanding a substantial increase in the health budget, amounting to some €1.7 billion a year, since 2013. We are now spending more per head than almost any country in the world, and we have been spending more than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average per head for 20 years now, including during the recession period. It should be obvious that the problems in our health service, which are real, are much deeper than finance and staffing numbers. Looking at nursing numbers, OECD statistics show that we have among the highest number of nurses per head and per bed in the world. However, nurses here are not deployed in the way they should be. Nurses spend too much time doing non-nursing tasks that could be done by people who have other qualifications and who do not have to be as highly qualified as are our nurses to do those jobs. There are major structural problems in our health service which have not been solved by extra staff and extra resources in the past number of years. We need to move on from that to much deeper levels of reform. The Deputy is correct that agency spending is very high. However, in the broader context it must be noted that it counts for approximately 2% of the health budget as a whole. When one considers that payroll takes up approximately half of the health service budget, roughly 4% of the payroll budget is accounted for by agency staff. For every 25 people working in our health service it is likely that one is an agency worker. I contend that if one went into other workplaces, such as big companies, public bodies and perhaps even media organisations and saw 25 people working, there is a good chance that one of those 25 is working with an agency or is working on a temporary basis. That happens for many different reasons, including maternity leave cover, cover for temporary absences or extra staff taken on during periods when capacity has to be increased as part of a core-flex arrangement. In our health service there are many doctors who are no longer willing to commit to long-term careers in smaller hospitals. Those doctors want to work in big hospitals, where there are opportunities to do research and other things. That is a structural change we are just going to have to face up to in our health service in the future. The Government has made many changes in this area. We have negotiated a new pay deal with public servants, including doctors, nurses, support staff, healthcare assistants and therapists, to restore pay. Pay restoration is well under way. There will be two pay increases this year, and another two next year, for all of our healthcare staff. We are also engaging with the unions on two other issues, namely, recruitment and retention of doctors and nurses and the two different pay scales for those who came into the public service after 2011 and 2012. As is always the case, the Government has to put the interests of patients and taxpayers first, which means ensuring that we do not deploy or spend more taxpayers' money than is necessary, as well as ensuring that any increase in the payroll bill actually results in better patient care and that the money goes to the patient and not just to the employee. 
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	23	I am not asking the Taoiseach to do anything other than to engage in wise and prudent use of public moneys. If, however, it is his view that there is not a crisis in the recruitment and retention of medical staff, particularly nurses, I must inform him that there are lots of people working on the front line who would strongly disagree with him. I am putting the simple proposition to the Taoiseach that €300 million spent in a calendar year on the recruitment of agency staff does not represent good value for money. I am suggesting that there are things that need to be done to address that situation. This is a long-running problem. I have given the Taoiseach figures for 2017, but we could go back further and identify the same problem. We have to decide that we are going to give our nurses, for example, a fair deal, that there will be full pay equalisation and that, having trained the best and brightest, we are not content any longer to allow them to emigrate, thereby losing all of their skill and expertise. Can the Taoiseach indicate in concrete terms how he proposes to address this situation? It is not just a case of how much money is spent. We could debate the overall resourcing of the health service on another occasion. I expect that we are on different sides of that argument. It is not just a case of how much money is spent, it is a question of how it is spent. Agency staffing is clearly not an optimum, desirable or prudent solution.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	24	There are just over 10,000 doctors working in our public health service. That is the highest number ever. I accept that demand is higher than ever as well, but it is not the case that the number of doctors working in our public health service is falling. In fact, it is increasing and is at its highest point ever. Nursing numbers did go down considerably on foot of the cutbacks during the recession. We have approximately 1,000 more nurses than we had this time last year, so, again, we are going in the right direction. That is not to dismiss for a second the fact that posts are unfilled or that we have serious problems with recruitment and retention in different parts of the health service. However, it would be factually untrue to say that the number of doctors or nurses working in our health service is falling. The number of doctors working in our public health service is at an all-time high. The number of nurses working in our public health service is increasing. We must be able put it in that factual context. People are entitled to their own opinions; they are not entitled to their own facts. I will describe what we are doing other than pay restoration, which is now very much under way, with two pay increases this year and two more next year - that is before increments. We have specifically given the Public Service Pay Commission the job of examining the issues of recruitment and retention, looking at where in the health service there genuinely is a recruitment and retention problem, where there is not, where it is the result of maldeployment and where particular incentives may need to be put in place for certain grades and professions. It is not an issue across the board. It applies in some places, some professions and some posts. If we really care about ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent and goes toward patient care, we need to make sure that we have targeted recruitment and retention incentives, not blanket ones across the board whereby the money would not go to the patient.

I am referring to the proposed mechanical harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay, which is supposed to commence on Wednesday next. Last week, the company carrying out this mechanical harvesting issued a letter to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government saying that it is to commence mechanical harvesting of kelp - better known to all as seaweed - on Wednesday next, 4 July. While that date may be Independence Day in the USA, it is seen as doomsday for many who live near Bantry Bay, where 1,860 acres of seaweed will be mechanically harvested. In the past 12 months, action groups have mobilised peacefully in west Cork to try to find a solution to this major issue. Hundreds have attended public meetings in Bantry. Some 13,000 signatures have been collected for petitions against this happening in Bantry Bay. As other public representatives have aided them in every way humanly possible, we have tried in that 12 months to get a meeting between the action group and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, but to no avail. This begs the question as to what is going on here. In his reply to questions I raised some months back, the then Minister said that he did not know what impact this would have when completed but that the Government will know whether to grant further licences when the harvesting in Bantry Bay has taken place.This means that the harvesting of Bantry Bay could well be an experiment that could have devastating consequences for tourism, for the livelihood of 50 inshore fishermen and our environment. It could also have a very negative impact on the habitat for sea life in the waters of the world famous Bantry Bay. This will not just affect Bantry Bay. It will have a knock-on effect on the Beara Peninsula as well as the Sheepshead Peninsula. An advertisement for a licence was first seen in the local Southern Star and on a note at the local Garda station on 12 December 2009, stating the intention to occupy an area of the foreshore to harvest specific seaweed types. No one really understood what it meant. No information of it being a huge area of 1,860 acres was on the advertisement and there was no offer of meetings or information sessions on such an important issue for the public who live and work at Bantry Bay. There was no explanation either on how this could be mechanically harvested in the existing special protected area of the bay. The little advertising it got then did not raise any concerns in 2009. Now, almost ten years on, west Cork is very aware of what is going on and its potential outcome. The experts have requested the Minister and everyone involved to carry out a risk assessment prior to the commencement of works of the likelihood of kelp ever regrowing having been cut at 25 cm. The impact of climate change and the lack of a full risk assessment may leave Bantry Bay the worst example of experimental marine destruction in the whole of Ireland, the UK and Europe, as the mechanical harvesting of kelp is now banned in Nordic countries because of the devastation caused to the marine ecosystem, the wipe-out of shellfish and white fish stocks and the rapid growth of invasive species. I ask the Taoiseach to intervene immediately and call for all parties to step back until a full environmental impact study takes place.

It is an area I know well. I have had the pleasure of visiting Bantry House and the chamber music festival and I know the harbour very well from my time as transport Minister, although I do have to admit to not being fully briefed on this particular matter and I apologise for that. If the Deputy can give us a heads up a few hours in advance in future I will make sure I am briefed in time for the question. I am, however, advised by my Ministers that a court case is under way on this particular matter. A judicial review has been sought and given the fact it is a court or legal process I certainly cannot intervene in it. The Deputy will understand why I am not in a position to intervene if a judicial review is sought or under way. I am advised an environmental impact statement or assessment has been done, which I imagine should have answered some of the questions the Deputy has raised.

I appreciate he may not be fully aware of this circumstance, but I saw the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, giving him plenty of prompts when I was speaking earlier. I wish he gave him plenty of prompts over the past 12 months because that is what was needed but, unfortunately, that is not the case. The Taoiseach said a legal case is being brought but I ask the Taoiseach to remember this is overshadowed by the company stating it is going ahead in spite of any legal case being brought against it. For over a year the Government stood idly by when all experts were raising alarm bells. We are not talking about an acre of sea water, we are talking about 1,860 acres of potential destruction of the most stunning waters in the country in Bantry Bay. This is where the Taoiseach can intervene. Article 12.2 of the licence granted states that without prejudice to clause 12.1 the licence may be determined at any time by the Minister giving three months notice in writing, where the licence shall be deemed revoked and withdrawn without payment of any compensation or refund by the Minister to the licensee. This could have been stopped and it still can be. I ask all to come clean and give us the reason it has not been stopped to date. The 13,000 people cannot be wrong. Saving Bantry Bay now lies in the hands of the Government to make a decision before next Wednesday, 4 July. I sincerely hope it will not abandon the people of west Cork on this issue.

What we have to do when it comes to all of these issues is to balance on the one hand the need to protect our environment and on the other ensuring we promote marine rural employment and marine rural industries. I am advised that the licence was the subject of a piece on a recent edition of the "Eco Eye" programme but that neither the Department nor BioAtlantis Limited was asked to contribute. They would argue that the piece in question did not accurately reflect all the facts of the case, including the extent of the area to be harvested annually or the provisions regarding sustainability inserted into the granted licence. An environmental impact assessment was not carried out. Such an assessment is a mandatory requirement for a wide range of public and private projects - including those relating to motorways, airports, installations and the disposal of hazardous waste - under annexe 1 of the relevant directive. However, an assessment was not necessary in this case because the proposed project is not within a Natura 2000 site and is not of a class set out in the directive to which I refer.

For a considerable time, there has been serious concern that the price that the EU and Ireland are prepared to pay for stemming migration is the gross abuse of the human rights of migrants. The Irish office of Amnesty International has stated, "The Libyan coastguard is intercepting people in distress at sea and transferring them to Libya, where they are being held in detention centres and exposed to systematic and widespread human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture, rape and exploitation." The statement goes on to indicate that while Ireland is not directly sending people back to Libya, it shares responsibility due to Europe's joint actions to strengthen the capacity of the Libyan coastguard to intercept people and return them to Libya. Amnesty International has said that EU member states, including Ireland, cannot plausibly claim to be unaware of the grave violations being committed by some of the detention centre officials and coastguard agents with whom they co-operate. It has also argued that European Governments, including Ireland, stand accused of being knowingly complicit in the torture and exploitation of thousands of migrants and refugees by the EU-financed Libyan coastguard and officials running the country's detention camps. The UN human rights chief, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, has also described the suffering of migrants in these camps as "an outrage to the conscience of humanity". Médecins sans Frontières has also supported, in various reports, the views of those other organisations. In view of the human rights abuses in Libya I have outlined, will the Taoiseach order Irish vessels to cease all co-operation with the Libyan coastguard? Will his Government cease participation in the training and funding of the Libyan coastguard through Operation Sophia? In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, I was told that, on its tour of duty, the LÉ Niamh rescued more than 600 migrants, 294 of whom were put ashore in Italy. Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil to what non-Irish vessels were the remaining more than 300 migrants transferred? Where were those transferred migrants put ashore in each case? Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that none of these migrants was transferred to the Libyan coastguard by the LÉ Niamh or to any other vessel to which they had already been transferred?

We will not do so. I am very proud of the work that our Naval Service and Defence Forces are doing in the Mediterranean, rescuing migrants from the sea and training the Libyan coastguard to do what a coastguard should be able to do, namely, secure its seas and do its work, at least in its own territorial waters. It is an operation of which we are part. We are very proud of our Naval Service for being part of it. That will continue. The Deputy asked if people were transferred to the Libyan coastguard. I am advised by the Minister of State with responsibility for defence that this was not the case and people transferred to other boats were brought to Italy. I will seek confirmation of that to ensure I am correct in that regard. It is evident to everyone in Europe that we face a large amount of migration from the Middle East and Africa. The numbers have decreased considerably in the past couple of years.Anyway, it has had a big effect on the politics of Europe. We see that from the elections in Italy, where a populist anti-immigrant government has been elected and in the countries of central and eastern Europe, where anti-immigration governments have been elected. We cannot be in denial about the fact that this has changed politics. Public opinion in Europe is changing too. We see it evident in Germany, which was initially welcoming to millions of migrants. Now, public opinion is in a very different place in Germany and we cannot be blind to the realities of that.

What is required is that we do three things. The first is that we co-operate with the source countries and transit countries. The second is that we step up border security on the Balkan borders and in the Mediterranean. The third is that we engage in burden sharing. We do that already. We have agreed to take 4,000 migrants from the camps in Italy and Greece. Approximately half of them have arrived. We will continue to accept more. I met some of them when they arrived - they were mainly coming from Syria. When it comes to co-operation with source countries and transit countries, we have to bear in mind why people risk their lives to travel to Europe and to cross the seas in the way they do. It is because they come from countries that are badly governed or unsafe or where there is no economic opportunity. That is why it must be part of the core mission of Europe, when it comes to the Middle East and Africa, to try to build peace and security and bring about economic opportunities in the Middle East and Africa. We have seen how the power of the free market in Asia has lifted 1 billion people out of poverty in 20 years. We need to see that kind of power happen in Africa as well so that people are not forced to travel. We need to step up border security as well because what is happening is terrible. People are travelling huge distances. Traffickers put them in dinghies and boats that are not seaworthy knowing full well that European navies and others will come to the rescue and bring them the rest of the journey. That is something that cannot be encouraged. None of us should in any way encourage human trafficking of that nature. The Libyan coastguard has a big job to do to deal with that.

The detention centres, torture, rape and violation of human rights in these camps and detention centres in Libya are unacceptable. The United Nations, Amnesty International and Médecins sans Frontières all say that the Taoiseach, his Government and the EU are colluding in torture, rape and gross abuse of human rights. The Taoiseach is obviously in denial. I note he failed to give an assurance that Ireland will stop training and funding the Libyan coastguard and, through the coastguard, the Libyan Government, which is torturing migrants in these camps. The Taoiseach is Minister for Defence and, as such, he is responsible for this area of operations. In a parliamentary reply recently I was told that 139 suspected people smugglers or traffickers had been apprehended under Operation Sophia and that 545 boats were taken from criminal organisations. Were any of these boats or smugglers handed back to the Libyan coastguard? More important, were any of the refugees or migrants on these boats handed over to the Libyan coastguard or any other Libyan ships to be sent back to detention centres in Libya?

The Deputy ascribed comments to those various organisations. I am not sure that they said that about the Government. One or two might have but they certainly did not all say that. It is very much our position as a government that the camps or detention centres should be run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, or the International Organization for Migration, IOM.

Reception centres, where they exist, should be run by the UNHCR or the IOM so that we can be assured human rights are upheld and standards are protected. At the same time, we need to ensure we never equivocate on human trafficking. No one should do anything to facilitate these people smugglers and human traffickers.I am afraid that some actors in this area are doing that. It might not be their intention but they are doing it.

I am aware that we cannot have a debate about it now, but a very unusual set of rulings was made by the Chair at committee. Virtually every amendment proposed by the Opposition was ruled out of order on the basis of Standing Order 179(3), that is, on the basis that they proposed to impose a charge on the State. For example, an amendment that proposed to increase the compensation paid by employers generally was ruled out of order on the basis that the State is an employer. If that had general application we would never be able to propose an amendment to anything. If we were amending legislation on landlords or property rights, the State is a property owner. If we were amending contract law, the State enters into contracts and there might be a potential cost. It is a new departure which ruled out virtually all Opposition amendments. It puts us in an invidious situation in respect of Report Stage. I do not suppose there is a remedy for it but perhaps we could discuss it generally at the Sub-Committee on Dáil Reform.

The problem is that there are 80 minutes for the debate in total. The Government gets ten minutes and the Opposition gets 70.

One family has been followed from one town to another. The property the local authority were moving them into has been attacked. It is a huge issue. In the interests of accountability in the Oireachtas, I need to speak for my constituents here on Thursday.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	53	The report today that the half-year deficit in the HSE may rise to €300 million, with a further increase by the end of the year, certainly raises a continuing issue over transparency regarding the healthcare budget, the needs of the healthcare services generally and the role of the Government in its interaction with the HSE and the Oireachtas. Invariably, we are never presented with a full, transparent picture in advance of the budget. Last year, a deficit of approximately €140 million was shoved into this year. The problems will continue to build if there is not a proper, transparent assessment of need. There was some indication that Storm Emma and the influenza issue at the beginning of the year might have been factors. One third of the deficit is due to shortfalls in income, according to the Minister for Health in a response in May. The figures in the media today are real and have been confirmed by the Minister. Rather than just continuing with his defined role as a detached commentator on health matters, the Taoiseach should note that, as an Oireachtas, we need far more transparency than we are currently getting on health issues.

Part of the problem is transparency. The Government is not hiding anything. It is difficult to follow the money in our health service. We know there are overruns in many areas, and we do not know exactly why. It is certainly not because of increased output. It is not that 7% more patients are being seen or that 7% more operations are being carried out. Expenditure is increasing while output is not. In some cases, even attendances are not. We are trying to get to the bottom of the reasons for the overrun. When we do, will deal with the matter, sooner rather than later.

Today Pat's wife, Geraldine, and the Finucane family are in the British Supreme Court in an attempt to compel the British Government to fulfil its obligation to hold a public inquiry, as agreed at Weston Park in 2001. The Taoiseach may recall that in 2001 there was an agreement to examine four cases between the two governments. Three of these inquiries have taken place but the Pat Finucane inquiry has not. The de Silva report, published in December 2012, revealed a shocking scale of collusion between the British State and unionist paramilitaries. The fact of collusion in the killing of Pat Finucane is well established and accepted by the British Government. All of this serves to reinforce the need for an inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane. His family has campaigned long and hard and with great dignity and it is now time that the British Government stepped forward and met its obligations. The Taoiseach will recall that it is not just a matter of a commitment in the programme for Government but the decided will of the Oireachtas that the British Government should fulfil its obligations in respect of the inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane.

It is absolutely the Government's position that there should be a public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane. I understand the UK Supreme Court is hearing a case on it now. It would be best not to comment on it but we do believe there should be an inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane. The Tánaiste is due to meet the family again quite soon. It is absolutely something we will continue to raise with the British Government.

They directly contradict the views of the Government that there has been in-depth consultation with the Judiciary. They say that replacing the Chief Justice as chairperson, reducing the number of judges on the commission, creating a lay majority and having a lay chairperson accountable to Parliament were components which had never been subject to an independent review or scrutiny or expert report. In light of all the views throughout Europe about independent judiciaries and the concerns about the undermining of judicial independence, as well as the views of GRECO and the European Commission, will the Taoiseach pause and reflect again on the Bill?

I have taken careful note of what was said by GRECO and I had the opportunity of meeting the body. One of the many amendments to the Bill relates directly to the point raised by GRECO on the number of judges on the proposed new commission. I was pleased the House agreed an amendment to increase that number to five, which will comprise representatives of all courts. Due to the importance of the point raised by the Deputy, I acknowledge some work must be done on this. Again, I urge the co-operation of all Members when it comes back from the Seanad to reform and modernise our legislation in accordance with international best practice.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	63	Last week the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, upheld the right of a vulture fund to issue eviction orders to more than 20 households at Leeside Apartments in Cork in the middle of the largest housing crisis in the history of the State. Many of the households have children and are low-income. Many of the residents have had Leeside Apartments as their home for years. One of them, Aimee O’Riordan, the mother of a five-year-old son, was here to tell her story this morning. All of them - men, women and children - now face the prospect of being made homeless. They have nowhere else to go - all of this to maximise profits for a vulture fund. The guidelines issued to the RTB before Christmas by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, failed to protect the Leeside Apartments residents, despite them offering to vacate their homes for a month to allow for renovations. The Minister has promised to bring in fresh legislation should his guidelines fail to protect residents in such cases. Will he comment on this case? Will he inform the House of his plans to bring in the legislation which he promised?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	64	It is not the case that the guidelines failed to protect the residents in this instance. The fact of the matter is that an independent body, the RTB, found that substantial refurbishment was required and the measure was properly invoked in terms of the notice to quit the apartments themselves. In November last year, the board published detailed guidelines as to what "substantial refurbishment" means. It remains a requirement whereby landlords can serve a notice to quit if they want to make a substantial refurbishment necessary for their property. That said, we have recognised that some people have tried to use this as an excuse to evict tenants on spurious grounds, regardless of being appropriate. As a result of that, I will bring forward a second rent protection Bill this year with measures relating to substantial refurbishment to protect tenants who are being abused in such instances.

More than 40 years since the introduction of free legal aid, there is still no such option available for Irish families facing eviction from family homes and farms. I note the Josie Airey case was led by Mary Robinson at the time. The situation has led to persons regularly being sent to jail when they will not vacate their homes. We have a housing crisis. When will the Taoiseach introduce free legal aid for these people who are being intimidated by the justice system? They get legal aid in the Supreme Court after having no representation all that time. They get it then because of the Government's fear of the European courts. Will the Taoiseach please introduce free legal aid for these people who are trying to keep roofs over their heads? There are criminals with 40 previous convictions who get free legal aid - sometimes they have 100 previous convictions - yet families trying to keep a roof over their heads cannot get free legal aid.

The recruitment and retention problems within the health service are now reaching crisis point. Sláintecare is an all-party strategy to address those kinds of deep structural problems and to bring about reform of the health service to bring it in line with best practice in Europe. We do not know where the Government stands on Sláintecare. The Taoiseach promised a Government response by last Christmas. He promised the establishment of an implementation office. He promised a lead executive would be recruited months ago. None of these things has happened. He promised legislation in this area and we still have not seen it. What is the Government's position on Sláintecare?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	146	The implementation office has been established and we are in a position to appoint a lead executive for Sláintecare so we should be able to do that very shortly. In the next couple of weeks, the Minister will bring the implementation plan to Cabinet. While the Sláintecare report is very good and contains principles I agree with, it falls down in many areas. When one reads the sections on recruitment and retention, using public money efficiently and making sure the money actually gets to the patient, there is not an awful lot in it, which is why we needed to do so much work to bring it to implementation plan standard.

I was very glad that the Taoiseach seemed to indicate that with regard to Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, he intended to have a plebiscite to introduce the ability of people to vote for mayors. With regard to Dublin, he said he would have to look at the issue because it was complex. Has the Taoiseach decided on the issue of allowing the people of Dublin to have a directly elected mayor? There was a slight caveat when I read the Official Report afterwards. The Taoiseach seemed to indicate he would have the plebiscite in May. I assumed the Taoiseach intended to have the plebiscite this October and we would vote for mayoral candidates in May. Is the Taoiseach considering having a plebiscite in May at the same time we have the local elections? It would be slightly farcical to ask people if they want a different system and at the same time getting them to vote in the old system. Will the Taoiseach confirm what exactly the intended arrangements are?

Will the Taoiseach take up a matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on showing flexibility for farmers who are participating in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and who have taken up the traditional hay meadow option within that scheme, which prevents the cutting of grass and hay before 1 July? It is five days from now. I contacted the Minister over the weekend to ask that some flexibility be shown. He has so far refused to do so. It is important, given we need to replenish fodder stocks, that every opportunity is given to the farming community to ensure it maximises fodder saving this year. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to me on this matter and to take it up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to see that some flexibility is given in order that farmers can get on with that important work.

In the cold spell we had last March, the Taoiseach called in an emergency response unit to deal with the crises that would result from the very cold weather. While everybody welcomes fine weather, it brings a considerable number of challenges, particularly for elderly people and the farming community. There are concerns about forest fires and water shortages, particularly in the cities. I ask the Taoiseach to consider reconvening the emergency response unit because although fine weather is something we all enjoy and welcome, the challenges it brings are no less serious than they were during the cold weather. I ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider that because it may be necessary if it continues for the period that has been forecast.

During the cold snap, the farming community was absolutely instrumental in helping out our communities. It is a reasonable request to bring the cutting date forward to accommodate farming families. I call on the Taoiseach to do that. I have written to the Minister on the issue.

I have been contacted by 20 constituents who are involved in the GLAS. We need flexibility on this. Last year, as a result of the bad weather, those farmers could not cut the meadows. Now they want a little bit of flexibility to cut them when the weather is good. We do not know when the weather will break. I have been in contact with the Minister and had no response. I ask the Taoiseach to get involved and ask him to bring a bit of flexibility to it.

It is only a matter of a couple of days until 1 July. Farmers are entered into a contract under the GLAS. In the constituency I represent in Sligo-Leitrim and south Donegal, there is a real urgency about this. The same issue arises in north Donegal. My colleague, Deputy McHugh, spoke to me earlier today about it. It is vitally important to give farmers an opportunity to cut hay this week because we do not know what the weather will be like. For some of the areas I represent it is vitally important that we get a positive response.

That is what the farmers are trying to do. This is a very simple issue. The Department has shown flexibility in the past when there were crises, particularly around the slurry issues. It is very sensible to simply allow a little flexibility in order that farmers can cut hay meadows a couple of days earlier. If they have to wait until 1 July, they may not be able to save the hay because it may be raining. It is as simple as that. A little bit of flexibility by the Minister would solve an awful lot of problems.

Unfortunately our calls seem to be falling on deaf ears because the Minister made an announcement yesterday that he would not allow farmers this vital exemption. It would only be between now and 1 July, which is next Sunday. It is so important that the Taoiseach should go to the Minister today and, in the interest of common sense and the honour of God, tell him we have this great opportunity.People should be encouraged to cut rushes and they should be baling, not alone cutting, hay. However, they have to wait until next Sunday. If the weather was to break next week, it would cost individual farmers thousands and thousands of euro. This is an opportunity that should be seized upon. It would be mighty for the Taoiseach to be seen to be directly getting involved in this. The people would be delighted with him.

We do not believe it is necessary at this time to convene the national emergency co-ordination group because we are at status yellow. Given the nature of the weather we are having, perhaps that should be "status bronze". We will keep it under review. On GLAS, I am advised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there is no law or regulation prohibiting farmers from cutting hay before 1 July. Under GLAS, however, some farmers have opted into the traditional hay meadow action. This is a voluntary action as part of a voluntary scheme. If farmers opt into the scheme, they are compensated at a rate of €315 per ha up to a maximum of 10 ha. This is a biodiversity measure and will deliver approximately €18 million in payments this year. The purpose of it is to maintain and conserve grassland flora and fauna.

I was honoured to be the first EU leader to meet with Pedro Sanchez since his appointment as Prime Minister of Spain when I visited Madrid on 14 June. Ireland and Spain have a long history of excellent bilateral relations and our discussions were especially friendly and constructive. The Prime Minister and I exchanged views on important issues on the EU agenda, including Brexit, foreign policy issues and bilateral relations. In addition, I briefed him on developments in Ireland, including in respect of the economy, and he briefed me on developments in Spain, including priorities for his incoming Government. He assured me of Spain's strong commitment to the EU, and we agreed that the union should focus on issues that can have a positive impact on the lives of its citizens, including jobs and growth. We both agreed that maintaining an open and rules-based approach to trade is important for Europe’s future prosperity. I briefed Prime Minister Sanchez on Ireland’s concerns regarding Brexit, particularly the vital importance of the backstop arrangement to ensure that there can be no return to a hard border on this island. I stressed that there was now an urgent need to intensify efforts if we are to reach agreement on the withdrawal agreement in good time, securing a period of stability that is of great importance to citizens and enterprises in the EU and, of course, the UK. He offered me his full support and solidarity. On migration, the Prime Minister briefed me on his Government’s decision to accept migrants on board the Aquarius, and we agreed on the need to find long-term solutions to this issue, which has become such a divisive one within the Union. We agreed that any solution had to include supporting economic and political development in Africa, and creating better life opportunities for people there, especially young people, as well as improving security and governance.  We discussed the Commission’s proposal for the new EU budget and we agreed on the importance of maintaining spending on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, at its current levels, which is vital for our rural and regional communities. We also agreed on the importance of cohesion spending. We both support a forward-looking budget to meet the challenges of the future, including considering new priorities if they bring added EU value. My visit to Madrid included an event with the Spanish-Irish business network, where I had the opportunity to engage with our state agencies working in Spain, and representatives from the telecommunications, banking, tourism, and agrifood sectors. I was impressed by the growing and vibrant links between our enterprise sectors. I have not yet had an opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Conte of Italy. I have written to congratulate him on his appointment and to wish him well in his new role. I look forward to meeting him at the European Council in Brussels later this week. I have had three scheduled bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands - in Tallinn on 29 September, in Dublin on 6 December and, most recently, in Brussels on 22 March. I have previously reported to the House in detail on those meetings. I also meet Prime Minister Rutte at formal and informal meetings of the European Council, including those in June, October, November and December of last year, and February, March and May this year. We will meet again later this week. We both attended a meeting of the Nordic-Baltic group prior to the European Council last October, and an informal dinner hosted by Prime Minister Michel in Brussels in February. Ireland and the Netherlands are like minded on many EU issues, and my exchanges with Prime Minister Rutte are always open and constructive. Prime Minister Rutte has been strongly supportive of Ireland’s position and we are together in our wish to see a comprehensive and ambitious future relationship with the UK, particularly in the area of trade.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	166	I tabled two questions regarding the Prime Minister of Spain and the Prime Minister of Italy. On 12 December 2017, the Government stated that phase 2 Brexit talks would be suspended if there was any backsliding by the United Kingdom in respect of the backstop text. Since then, the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that they have, indeed, been backsliding. In recent days he said that no progress had been made in turning the backstop into a legal text. Can the Taoiseach confirm his statement at the weekend that he believed there had been no progress on the backstop text? Given that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have spent months demanding progress by June, can the Taoiseach outline how he reconciles this with the fact that there is no consequence whatsoever for the backsliding? The Tánaiste said if there was no agreement or some progress, by June, it was questionable whether there would be agreement at all on the issue. While we see no alternative to the approach which the Council will take on Friday, it has badly exposed the tough talking of our Government as overhyped and more focused on headlines than substance. Can he outline what initiatives he has planned for the next two months to ensure progress is made before the run-up to the October summit? It is reported that the Government, along with 11 others, signed a letter which has been criticised today by the French Government because it opposes proposals for a eurozone budget. Had such a budget existed in 2010, there is no doubt that the Portuguese and Irish bailouts would not have happened. It is an essential element of preventing a reoccurrence of the sovereign debt crisis. Why did the Taoiseach agree for Ireland to sign up to such a letter? Ireland should be one of the strongest supporters of the Franco-German initiative on this matter. However, at the first opportunity, we have rowed in behind a counteroffensive. Why?
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	167	I refer to the Taoiseach's visit to Spain and wish to raise the ongoing political crisis in Catalonia. Did the Taoiseach raise the issue with the new Spanish Prime Minister? The silence from many European states has been deafening when it comes to condemnation of political repression in Catalonia, which has been orchestrated mainly by the Spanish Government. There are now nine political prisoners jailed and awaiting trial for so-called rebellion for organising last year's independence referendum. In Germany, an extradition warrant for the former President, Carles Puigdemont, was declined because the court decided there was no evidence of any form of violence by the organiser of the referendum and, in Belgium, we had the bizarre spectacle of prosecutors urging a court to throw out the warrant request for two former Catalan Ministers. The position that political repression in Catalonia is an internal matter for Spain is no longer a practical way of moving forward. The Government needs to condemn the Spanish Government for jailing political prisoners and political activists and I sincerely hope the Taoiseach raised concerns about these matters in his recent visit. ETA recently announced a definitive end to the organisation and created a historic opportunity for the Spanish Government to send a positive signal of its intent to embrace a peace process in that region, which is long overdue. Basque prisoners dispersed throughout Spain need to be brought back home as an initial step in that process. On 10 June, over 175,000 people from across the Basque region formed a 200 km human chain across the country demanding the right of these prisoners to be brought home and that of the people of the Basque region to democratically decide their own future. I am sure whether the Taoiseach is aware of these events. Did he raise them with the Spanish Prime Minister in his recent visit?

Spain is now at the centre of it, along with Italy and Greece. The Taoiseach said that the upcoming Council is centre stage.In the Taoiseach's conversations with the Spanish Prime Minister, who will be looking at things such as a new government and security arrangements, did Mr. Sánchez give any indication as to what that might mean for us and what we might be required to support? In an earlier question today the Taoiseach cited the fact that we had previously agreed to accept 4,000 programme refugees from Syria in the last iteration of the crisis. Does the Taoiseach believe that, after the upcoming meetings, we will be looking to increase our intake of refugees as part of the overall management of this crisis and not leave everything on the shoulders of Spain, Greece and Italy? With regard to the Dutch Prime Minister, it is true we are close and, as I understand it, an informal relationship is developing, not just with the Dutch Government but also between the Scandinavian governments, the Baltic states and ourselves as an antidote to the potential future departure of Britain from the EU. Can the Taoiseach tell me if the Dutch Prime Minister has indicated, or is there collective work on, any kind of informal meetings with such a grouping, either meeting together in advance of or separate to a European Council meeting so that it would take on some sort of shape other than just a media notion? Have there been any sort of informal approaches to how we could work with such states within the Union in a collaborative way?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	169	Two issues will dominate the upcoming European Council meeting and we will have a chance to deal with them tomorrow in statements. Those are the issues of migration and Brexit. We had assumed up to relatively recently that the Brexit issue would be the definitive one. It may well be eclipsed now by migration. On the strong words expressed in this House last week by the President of the European Commission, does the Taoiseach remain confident that support for Ireland is solid? I am hearing reports from Brussels that the so called Visegrad group of countries - Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary - is suggesting that a deal on trade is very important and might be more important to their interests than any issue in Ireland. It would be interesting to hear the Taoiseach's view on that. We were supposed to have a definitive decision on the Irish Border issue for this Council meeting. I expressed my concerns for some months now that this may well be fudged again and that we would be in a difficult position in the run up to the October Council. We are, however, where we are and we can only hope that all member states have a clear line supporting the Taoiseach to ensure that we too are crystal clear that there can be no ongoing trading relations or no long-term deal until these matters are resolved. I address the issue of migration. I presume the Taoiseach expressed congratulations to Prime Minister Sánchez on accepting a migrant boat into Spanish ports when it was rejected by Italy and Malta. What did the Taoiseach suggest that Ireland, in concrete terms, could do to address the European problem with migration? 
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	170	On the issue of Brexit, the Border, the backstop and all that, last week I asked President Juncker whether we could trust him and the European Union on this issue. He looked slightly annoyed but shouted "yes", that we could trust them, across the Chamber. Is the Taoiseach fully confident that the European Union, if negotiations fail and there is no agreement with the UK, is not going to protect the Single Market and insist that some sort of Border is put in place? I ask that because while I do not trust Mrs. Theresa May one inch and I find her Little Englander, xenophobic nationalism obnoxious in the extreme, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act that passed today in the Houses of Parliament, and this has not been mentioned in any media discourse, actually has legal provisions saying that there will be no Border. Section 17 of the Act says that after negotiations, regardless of the outcome of those negotiations, there will be no customs posts, no Border checks, no random stopping of cars or vehicles etc. There will be no Border. It is absolutely spelt out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act and that is law now in Britain. They can of course change the law and I do not trust them but at least it is in the law and it has been passed by the British Houses of Parliament. Where is the guarantee from the European Union?

It now has legal force. The law will have to be changed to impose a Border. That is obviously because of the pressure from this country, within Britain and from all sorts of forces but it is now translated into law. That is binding on the British Government.

In the Taoiseach's discussions with the Spanish Prime Minister, did he discuss the issue of Palestine and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza which takes on more importance now that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, is saying that it does not have money to sustain its aid and education programmes in Gaza and the West Bank?

It is my judgment, and the Tánaiste's, currently that stalling the talks would not be the right approach. What happens invariably when walking out of talks is that sooner or later there is a need to walk back in again. It is our view that what is required now is that we intensify the talks and that is what we expect to happen so that we can come to an agreement in October. As Deputies will know, the withdrawal agreement has to be ratified both by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament and we need those few months between the end of October and end of March to make sure that agreement is ratified. I am also confident that the European Parliament will not ratify an agreement that either undermines the integrity of the Single Market or for some reason would leave Ireland adrift. When the recess comes, I intend to use that period to do some shuttle diplomacy. I have managed to meet bilaterally with many prime ministers, either here in Dublin or in their capital cities, and I intend to use the recess to meet some more, visit some more EU capitals and receive some more people here. We will also be involved in intensifying negotiations through the task force and we will have to continue to step up our contingency planning to prepare for the possibility, however remote, that there may be a no-deal Brexit. On the eurozone budget issue which Deputy Micheál Martin raised, I am not sure which letter he is referring to but if there was-----

To answer the question I was asked earlier, I am fully confident that the EU 27 have our back.Each member state knows that I will not agree, nor will the Government, to anything that gives rise to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I have not heard anything from the Visegrad Group, V4, to give me concern. Deputy Micheál Martin said that that group is keen to negotiate a trade deal with the UK. Ireland would also like to have such a deal, but everyone realises that it will take-----

I have no particular concerns regarding the V4 group, but I thank the Deputy for alerting me to that. I will make sure to check that out on Thursday and Friday. We also want to have a trade deal with the UK, but if the UK persists with its red-line issues, such as leaving the customs union and the Single Market, we will have to negotiate a new free trade agreement de novo, from scratch, which will take years. No free trade deal has ever been written in a few months; they all take years. If the UK persists with its views on leaving the Single Market and the customs union, a free trade deal will take many years to negotiate. There must be a withdrawal agreement first. I do not see how we could have a trade agreement without having a withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, first. That is my position. The Basque Country was not discussed. Palestine was not discussed either. Venezuela was discussed, but the Deputy did not mention it so I will not go through it in too much detail.

I got the sense that the new Spanish Prime Minister wants to arrive at a solution within the constitutional rules of Spain and that a more conciliatory approach will be adopted towards Catalonia.

As previously indicated, the national risk assessment is an annual exercise, which aims to ensure a broad-based and inclusive debate on the strategic risks facing the country. It focuses on the identification of risks and is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management and mitigation that happens across Departments and agencies in respect of individual risks. As in previous years, my Department, working with a cross-departmental steering group, prepared the initial draft of this year’s report. The draft also reflects feedback from the open policy debate in April where representatives from business, media, research and education institutions, civil society groups and the public sector were invited to discuss a draft list of risks. Following approval by the Government on 22 May, the draft was laid before the Oireachtas and published for public consultation. The draft report is published and available to read on my Department’s website. The public consultation period closed last week.  The draft report includes some new risks this year, including the impact of social media on public debate and the risk of overheating the economy. Existing risks have also evolved. For example, the risks arising from Brexit have developed significantly and remain prominent. Other risks include international uncertainties around tax and trade, increasing expectations for higher public expenditure, infrastructure constraints, housing supply and affordability problems which persist. As in previous years, risks around climate change and the need for a secure and diverse energy supply present significant challenges for Ireland. They do so in terms of achieving national and international targets, mitigating our emissions and adapting to the effects of a changing climate. The cost of delayed action is discussed as a major factor in this risk.  While biodiversity is not listed as a separate risk in its own right, the potential impact of climate change on our ecosystems is recognised in the climate change section of the draft report. In particular, this section highlights the potential of climate change to cause changes in the distribution and time of lifecycle events of plant and animal species on land and in the oceans. Actions to tackle climate change will help maintain the integrity of our ecosystems and, therefore, ensure the natural biodiversity present in these ecosystems is protected. The draft report also highlights the need to invest in new economic opportunities in the bioeconomy, which recognises environmental sustainability, including biodiversity, as a core principle.  Finally, the report also notes the need to decouple economic growth from adding to environmental pressures such as climate change and declining biodiversity. Following the conclusion of the public consultation stage last week, the list of strategic risks and the 2018 report will be finalised and published in July. The purpose of the consultation is to encourage debate on strategic risks, and the views of Oireachtas Members are a welcome input to that discussion.

I asked that it be included again this year, and I made a submission through the consultation process to that end. In my lifetime we have lost half of the mass of wildlife, including invertebrates, on this planet. Half of the wildlife in the world has disappeared. We are at risk of losing 37 bird species, one third of our bumblebee species, salmon, eel and the freshwater pearl mussel, among other species, in this country. We tend not to notice these because they are small or hidden or take place over time. However, some day we will wake up and realise that all the other risks were minute compared to the risk of humanity inhabiting a planet where the natural world has been destroyed, frayed and torn apart.  Biodiversity is connected to climate, given the loss of habitat due to climate change. Loss of biodiversity will give us an indicator as to how we are doing on climate change. We need to take loss of biodiversity seriously, not for economic reasons but for reasons of our very sanity and of our sense of the world we are living in. We need a national land use plan. We need to stop burning the hills and cutting the hedgerows, which is what the Government is trying to pass legislation on at the moment. Such a move will destroy habitats unnecessarily. There was a debate earlier about cutting hay, and it was suggested that we bend the rules slightly because the weather is good at the moment. However, the RTÉ "Prime Time" programme last week showed what happens when the rules are bent on matters concerning nature. A risk to biodiversity should be included in the risk assessment. It is one of the big risks we face. Its inclusion might change what Government does and convince it to take the loss of biodiversity seriously.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	212	Words such as "biodiversity" confuse people because they are technical. We are talking about the birds, bees, trees and fish that sustain the ecosystem on which we depend for our survival. That ecosystem is under threat. It is an economic threat in the sense that the depletion of biodiversity means that, among other things, we potentially face huge fines. A diverse environment acts as a carbon sink. Monoculture forestry, for example, is not a good carbon sink compared to forestry made up of native broadleaf species. Deforestation has been a feature of reports over the past five or six years. Despite targets to increase afforestation, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, there is significant evidence of deforestation. Kelp is an example of where a commitment to biodiversity is not matched by action. BioAtlantis will start cutting down 1,900 hectares of trees of the sea in Bantry Bay, which will destroy biodiversity there. Another example is the fact that the Heritage Bill will extend the cutting season so that hedgerows can be cut down, which will deplete biodiversity as well. The Government is allowing that to happen. All the commitments to deal with climate change are not followed through. In reality, the Government is implementing measures which significantly degrade biodiversity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	213	I agree with the Green Party. It is correct that the issue of biodiversity should be explicitly addressed in the national risk assessment following the consultation period. The biggest reason for this is that existing commitments under the national biodiversity plan have not been implemented, and the greatest failings are linked directly to a lack of Government co-ordination and inaction. The latest biodiversity plan was published five years ago by the previous Government. Only one quarter of the specific recommendations and commitments in the plan have been implemented. For the 10% of commitments in which no progress has been made, the main issue is a failure of co-ordination in government and to communicate with the public.The communications failure is interesting, particularly as the objective was public education but the reality was Government brand-building and promotion. The latter is very similar to the approach the Taoiseach has been imposing across Government. Given the failures in the previous plan, can the Taoiseach indicate if he has taken any steps to ensure that this new plan will be implemented with urgency? I agree with the comments that have been made. We are reliant on non-governmental organisations, NGOs. For example, in the area of beekeeping and preservation of our bees, it is the NGOs that are developing action programmes and plans. In the context of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said regarding broadleaf trees, etc., there is similarly a lack of Government co-ordination and action on that front. I have often wondered what inspired the Heritage Bill 2016. Who was behind it? In view of the Department from which it originated, it was, from any perspective, quite absurd in the context of its provisions hedge-cutting and so on. What inspired the Minister? Who lobbied? Who was behind it and for what reason? It jars with our overall objectives and agenda in preserving our national biodiversity, which is at risk. We have been warned about this for years and decades. It should be explicitly part of a national risk assessment.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	214	Coming from a rural constituency, the issue of biodiversity is something of which I am very conscious. One of the issues mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, monoculture forestry, is a very clear problem. It is not afforestation for carbon sequestration or anything else. It is basically about the timber industry making maximum profit and being supported in that regard by Government and public policy. We need to see how public policy can be used to enhance biodiversity. One of the examples of that is through the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which was mentioned earlier. With respect, I disagree slightly with the Green Party in respect of bending the rules a little. Everything that happens in nature happens when weather changes. By and large, we have to work with the weather we are given. That is what farmers have to do and what they have always traditionally done. However, the intensification of agriculture has brought us in a different direction, and that has caused problems. We need to recognise and work with that. In fairness to most people in the farming community, they want to work with that and come up with solutions, but they need assistance in that respect. The issue facing us at the moment with the very warm weather is going to be around fodder and whether farmers will be able to get enough. Next winter people will be saying that we had a hot summer and that is the reason we do not have fodder. We will be facing a crisis. Then it will be a wet winter and then it will be something else. I acknowledge it is not something about which the Government can do anything. However, Government policy and public policy have roles to play. The seaweed harvesting that we see going on in Bantry Bay is the equivalent of pouring Roundup into the ocean. That needs to be acknowledged. Again, Government policy is at the root of that problem.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	215	This is a really important matter. One of our problems is that we debate issues such as biodiversity in isolation because they do not run across everything else we do. We do not have joined-up thinking on biodiversity. The national biodiversity action plan, published last year, should have been a wake-up call. It said that 90% of our habitats were in a bad or inadequate position. I refer to our peatlands. We are losing species, bees are under threat and yet we plough on with action plans in other areas without actual joined-up thinking in respect of them. We need to do that. Deputy Martin Kenny is right to say that we will have another fodder shortage. We import fodder because we have a developmental strategy for agriculture that is not sustainable. We have to decide what the island can sustain - for example, in regard to herd numbers - and what biodiversity we want. We must not set growth as the overarching objective that trumps all else. We need to think long and hard about what the island of Ireland will look like, what species we are determined to protect and what sort of joined-up thinking - running across economic policy, agricultural policy, transport policy and so on - is required to achieve those objectives.

I raised a Topical Issue matter last week in which I noted that Ireland came second last - just ahead of Poland - in a Climate Action Network, CAN, report on how countries are meeting their climate change obligations. Ireland came second last out of 28 countries. That is not a good place to be. Of course, climate change enormously affects species, the types and growth of trees and so on. We are nowhere near ready. We are drinking in the last chance saloon as regards our response. It is extremely disappointing that this Government really seems to have long-fingered it in a way that frankly is depressing. Climate change is leading to the enormous variations in the weather and is leading to the increase in the number of storms. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government has sought to respond to the storms and the orange and red warnings, we are nonetheless falling considerably behind. The other risk factor in being so poor on climate change is that in a couple of years we potentially face enormous fines for not addressing the issue. That financial risk to the country has not really been factored in or costed in the way that other such risks are.

The latest weather forecast indicates that it is going to rain on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. It may well be the case that the anticipated drought and dry weather-related fodder crisis may not materialise on this occasion. Damage to biodiversity is not a stand-alone strategic risk in its own right in the current draft. It is covered under the issue of climate change. I am certainly open to including it but a line has to be drawn somewhere. What I will have to do is examine the submissions with my officials . I suspect that when we examine them, we will see 20, 30, 40 or 50 other risks that people think should be included. One does need to draw the line somewhere. However, I am certainly not hostile to including additional risks if the submissions indicate that there is a consensus in favour of adding additional risks, like the risk to biodiversity. I will take account of what was said here today and consider it for the final iteration before it goes to Cabinet. Regarding biodiversity more generally, the action plan recognises that there is an increased need for funding. That was set out at the launch of the national development plan by the Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Finance, Deputies Madigan and Donohoe, and the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeilge, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy McHugh, as well as the State agencies which have been asked to contribute to the drafting of the plan. The plan's main aims are built around the need for all sectors of society to participate if we as a society are to conserve nature. The aims are: to mainstream biodiversity across decision-making in the State; strengthen the knowledge base underpinning work on biodiversity issues; increase public awareness and participation; ensure conservation of biodiversity in the wider countryside; ensure conservation in the marine environment; and expand and improve on the management of protected areas such as national parks, special areas of conservation, SACs, and protected species. The actions that the Government is taking include: legislation, for example, a Bill on national parks and the introduction of requirements that public bodies consider biodiversity policy in decision-making; actions involving forestry and agriculture, which account for 70% of total land use in the State; measures to reduce the impact of invasive alien species; and commitment to integrating biodiversity in our overseas aid programme. We recognise that biodiversity and healthy ecosystems have a role to play in underpinning many of the sustainable development goals and stronger partnerships are required in the area of sustainable development and climate finance to ensure that we protect our biodiversity. We are also investing in farmer-led, results-based payment schemes in the Burren, which have been a huge success over many years, and new schemes to protect the endangered hen harrier and the freshwater pearl mussel. Farmers are also paid both for work undertaken and for the delivery of defined environmental objectives, including sustainable management and restoration of high-nature farmland and improvements in water quality and water use efficiency.Continued investment in farmer-led results-based payment schemes will certainly benefit biodiversity and provide an excellent model for future agri-environmental supports in Ireland and in other countries. We are also investing in research into natural capital accounting and biodiversity financing to inform policy on the management and restoration of our natural capital stocks in Ireland and options for mobilisation of funding to address key biodiversity concerns. With regard to Bantry, which was raised earlier today, I am told it is a misconception that the licensee would be harvesting vast quantities of kelp from within the bay. Not all of the seaweed in the bay will be harvested. In fact, the total area licensed is 750 ha. This accounts for 0.7% of the bay and is split into five distinct zones. The licence provides for a four-year rotation of the zones with a stand-by zone only to be harvested if the weather is adverse. On average, 175 ha will be subject to harvest annually. The rotation will ensure that only a portion of the bay is harvested each year to strengthen the sustainability of the harvesting plan for the licensed areas in the bay. The harvesting is also subject to strict monitoring, which is required by the approval baseline study. The monitoring programme includes comparisons between harvested and non-harvested areas in each zone for density and height of kelp, together with a quantitative measure of flora and fauna. It has been suggested there has not been a public consultation on this issue. This is incorrect. The licence originally applied for back in 2009 was processed in the same way as other foreshore lease and licence applications and the normal public consultation procedures were followed but there were no submissions from the public. The public notice was published in the Southern Star and the application documents were on display in Bantry Garda station in December 2009 and January 2010. It has also been suggested that kelp will not grow back. There are, in fact, 21 peer-reviewed papers on kelp harvesting. They all prove that kelp grows back after harvesting. No paper shows that kelp does not grow back. Indeed, as kelp generates three to six years after harvesting, suggesting, for example, that it is akin to cutting down ancient woodland is not correct. Kelp maturity is reached after six years and on average kelp lives for eight years. There is no root system and it is easily lifted from the sea floor during storms. This is evidenced by the fact that 20% of Ireland's kelp is washed up on our beaches every year.

We need a land use plan that sets out how we will protect and develop diversity. Critically, if we get it right it will champion human diversity and life in rural Ireland. There was a meeting on Friday night in Leitrim, where communities are utterly despondent and do not see a future. They see their area covered in tree plantations or land being abandoned. We need to stop this and change it. We can do it best by setting ourselves a goal of creating a massive national park, not just in pockets but taking the whole Wild Atlantic way and seeing it as a national park where we protect biodiversity, and in doing that, create tens of thousands of jobs in forestry, tourism, clean energy and high-quality high-value food production where animal welfare comes first. What we need is a quantum leap and not just a tweak in the existing system. We should start with a tenfold increase in the budget for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is a Cinderella in the Irish public service. It does not have the resources we need. Put this into the plan and scale up the thinking on biodiversity because that is the answer to rural Ireland's future as much as anything else.

The people in west Cork will say very differently, in that the boxes were ticked but it was not a real consultation as very few people actually knew what was happening and what was proposed. We do not know what the impact of the cutting down of kelp may be, but it is certainly a spawning ground for many marine species and we do not know what the damage could be to those fish that spawn in those kelp fields. This is why people are very opposed to the harvesting commencing, particularly in advance of the judicial review. The Taoiseach did not respond on the Heritage Bill 2016, which runs completely against our commitment to maintaining biodiversity. It allows the cutting down of hedgerows, which are critical for sustaining biodiversity. Scrub, hedgerows and wild growth are absolutely critical from a climate change point of view and a biodiversity point of view. The Heritage Bill cuts very much against it.

A land use plan is a good idea and we will certainly give it some consideration. The Government and its Departments only have a certain amount of bandwidth to produce any number of plans in any given year but it is certainly something to which I am happy to give consideration. To an extent, the national planning framework does this but certainly not to the extent I know Deputy Eamon Ryan would like. I have to disagree on the suggestion we make the entire Wild Atlantic Way and entire western seaboard into a national park stretching along the entire coast through to Kerry. I really do not think people living in those counties would like their entire counties turned into national parks. People often criticise planning in Ireland that treats the west of Ireland as if it is an national park and does not bring to it or the western seaboard road infrastructure, broadband and all the things that allow people to participate in economic and social life.

People want to protect their environment but they also want economic opportunities, they want jobs, they want their children to be able to stay living in those areas and they want more people to be able to move into those areas and sustain the schools and all of the social infrastructure.

As he knows, there has been a protracted dispute and the State has sought to defend its position, in breach of the current legal framework. We need a full statement on why there was such a delay in upholding the law and vindicating the rights of people who work in the Defence Forces. Will he explain the current position?

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	237	I previously informed the House that the Government decision dated 18 November 2016 approved the drafting of the heads of Bill to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. This will remove the blanket exclusion of An Garda Síochána and members of the Defence Forces from its scope. This will be subject to the application of the appropriate exclusions and derogations permitted by Directive 2003/88/EC. Work is under way in both the Department of Defence and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on this decision. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the working time directive can be applied to the members of the Defence Forces. I will amend Defence Forces regulations as required to facilitate this process. I recently signed an amendment to Defence Force Regulation A.11 dealing with leave. This amendment increases to four working weeks from 19 days the amount of carry-over leave allowed to members of the Permanent Defence Force in circumstances where the member could not take annual leave due to being on certified sick leave, adoptive leave or maternity leave. My Department will engage through the conciliation and arbitration process with the Defence Forces representative associations to discuss the application of the provisions of the working time directive to the Defence Forces. However, this can be constrained if litigation is being pursued. Litigation taken by a member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of the applicability of certain elements of the working time directive to the Defence Forces was settled recently in the High Court, having regard to the specific circumstances of that case. Further litigation relating to the working time directive as it relates to the Defence Forces is pending. For these reasons it would not be appropriate to comment further.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	238	It is unfortunate the Defence Forces representative organisations and workers in the Defence Forces were stonewalled for so long. I seek an update on the heads of the proposed Bill and ask when it will progress through the House. The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, recently indicated that piecemeal amendments to Defence Forces regulations based on the outcome of High Court proceedings do not give confidence to its members. This is reflected in the position of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, as well. Why did it take so long for the Government to change its approach to this? Will the Minister of State confirm that it is now accepted by the Government that it will not rely on an exclusion clause contained in the legislation but it will bring members of the Defence Forces fully within the scope of the Act, subject to the application of derogations permitted by the working time directive? There does not seem to be any clarity, apart from the changes made to regulations. When will legislation be brought through the House and when will the Government give certainty to members of the Defence Forces and their organisations that they will be part of an inclusive process around the implementation of the working time directive?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	239	A decision by the European Court of Justice on 12 January 2006 in The Commission of the European Communities v. Kingdom of Spain clarified how the working time directive applies to non-civilian workers within the public service such as armed forces, military police and customs forces. A 2010 report followed from the European Commission dealing with the implementation of the working time directive, and it highlighted the same matters. The Department of Defence and military management continue to work together with a view to implementing the directive. Engagement has commenced with the representative associations and this will continue as appropriate. As I stated in my reply, legislation is being worked on by my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This position was taken by the Government some time ago. I have spoken with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, about this and I hope the Deputy accepts that as with all legislation, we must ensure we have it right in the drafting phase.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	240	The pace of legislation is very slow in this area. We have ongoing breaches of the working time directive and it was reported that 146,000 days of annual leave have been lost in the past five years among members of the Defence Forces. That is an enormous breach of this country's statutory process and the fact we are not seeking to rectify it very quickly does not give confidence to representative organisations. As they argue, amending regulations will not give confidence to them or their members on the upholding of the law. RACO has indicated its members lost 9.6 days of annual leave each and PDFORRA estimates that more than 6,000 members lost in the region of 37,000 days of annual leave in 2016 alone because the force was overstretched and members were constantly plugging gaps. We know, with the removal of the Western Brigade, how travel time has exacerbated problems in working life with those members. The State is standing over a breach of the law in the form of the working time directive without giving any certainty, even today, about when this will be rectified. This is apart from restating the position of the Government in 2016 concerning the amendment of the Act. We cannot have this continuing at a pre-drafting stage, as it has been there for two years.

I anticipate anything arising out of that will be a matter for discussion with the representative associations in the context of the conciliation and arbitration process. I reiterate that both military management and the Department of Defence are working to come to some conclusions on the issues raised by the Deputy. Engagement has started with the representative associations. We want the engagement to continue. If there is further litigation relating to the working time directive as it relates to the Defence Forces, it will delay the negotiations. If there is an issue, we should deal with it. I want to do that and I have instructed my officials on it. They have already met representatives of the associations and will continue to do so.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	242	As others have said, PDFORRA estimates that more than 6,000 members of the Defence Forces have lost in the region of 37,000 days of annual leave in 2016 because they were overstretched and continuously filling gaps in rosters. RACO believes each of its members lost, on average, 9.6 days of annual leave in the same year. This adds up to a disgraceful position for the workers in our Defence Forces. Annual leave is vital and it is not a gift. It is a necessity for the health and well-being of all workers. The Organisation of Working Time Act is a major bulwark against the exploitation of workers and sets out protection for annual leave, holiday pay, sick pay, night work, shift workers and overall working hours. The fact that Defence Forces members have been excluded from this is an injustice that must be rectified as soon as possible.Further cases are backing up in the courts and in light of this judgment, it is expected that many more cases will follow. It is vital, therefore, that the Government acts with haste now.

I hope the Deputy will accept that the nature of the duties of military life in general bring demands that are typical of other security and emergency services like An Garda Síochána. I said as much in my original reply. The directive allows for derogations and compensatory rest. As I indicated to Deputy Chambers, the Defence Forces and military management have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the working time directive can be applied to its members. On foot of that, I have directed my officials to sit down with both representative associations to ensure they are fully on board with the discussions. It is in the interests of all parties, including the representative associations, the Department and military management, to bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible. We have an issue and I want it dealt with and brought to a conclusion.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	244	The judgment at least speaks to the overall context of the Defence Forces and the rights of their personnel as workers. The judgment of the European Committee of Social Rights earlier this year upheld the entitlement of the Defence Forces to better collective bargaining and negotiation rights. We have been out of line with our European partner nations on workers' rights in the Defence Forces and the Garda, which experiences similar exclusions. This has gone on too long now. It is long overdue for a suite of legislative changes to be brought to the House to bring us into the 21st century in this regard. There is no excuse anymore for Ireland to lag behind in this area and no excuse for our Defence Forces to remain outside the industrial relations architecture and legislation of the State. The Minister of State needs to be proactive rather than wait for the courts to drive him to do the right thing by the Defence Forces. I am worried by one comment he made. He said that officials were engaged with the representative bodies on this matter but the matter may be constrained if litigation is pursued. Will the Minister of State flesh out what he means by that? I am particularly concerned by that. We need to take the initiative, deal with the matter on a sound basis and put the legislation in place. Let us not be talking about this in six months or a year and saying we are constrained by litigation that is under way.

Action was well under way with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This stems from a Government decision in 2016, if my memory serves me correctly. The Government has accepted that the blanket exclusion is not in keeping with the 2003 EU directive. Bringing forward this legislation is a priority. I want to ensure that when I bring forward the legislation it will be watertight, it will deal with the issue and we will not have to revisit it. I want to ensure it is sorted out once and for all. The legislation is being pursued. Work is being carried on and it involves the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department.

The contract comes at a cost of €7 million to the Exchequer for a two-year period.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	249	The Air Corps provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary security role. It also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks on an as-available basis, including the provision of air ambulance services to the HSE. The HSE aeromedical desk in the national emergency operations centre is responsible for the co-ordination of all health-related air transport arrangements. In addition to the Air Corps, the Coast Guard and private air ambulance operators also provide air transport services for the HSE. Capacity constraints within the Air Corps have impacted on the services it provides, including services provided to the HSE. Notwithstanding this, the Air Corps continues to provide significant air ambulance support to the HSE. The Air Corps inter-hospital service operates out of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The service provides transport for patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad. In 2017, the Air Corps completed 46 inter-hospital missions, including two priority transfers to the UK of children requiring organ transplants. The Air Corps also operates the emergency aero-medical support service. It is a daily, daytime service based in Custume Barracks in Athlone. Since the commencement of this service in June 2012, the Air Corps has completed more than 2,000 missions, with 357 missions during 2017. The emergency aero-medical support and inter-hospital services are good examples of the Air Corps and HSE combining their resources to deliver life-saving services for the people.

I wanted to ask whether the Department had tendered for the contract at all. It is obvious from the answer that there is no capacity within the Air Corps to go beyond what it is supplying at the moment. That is a poor reflection on Defence Forces management because the Air Corps has been unable to retain pilots, air traffic controllers or those who could operate some of the equipment and planes. I saw the equipment and planes when a delegation from the committee with responsibility for defence visited Baldonnel. The equipment basically sits in the hangars at night because insufficient cover is available. When will the capacity of the Air Corps be increased to allow it to deliver not only on its existing commitments but on additional support for the civil power so that we do not have to go to the private sector to deliver air transport for sick children whether within the island or overseas for emergency and other operations
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	251	The HSE undertook a formal tendering process for the provision of air ambulance services to transfer priority 1 paediatric transplant patients to the UK between 7 p.m. and 7.30 a.m. I am advised that three private companies bid for the contract. Following completion of the competitive process, the contract was awarded to Air Alliance Express and will be in place for a two-year period. I understand it is envisaged that the most of the patients who are expected to use the service will be children who need to go to the UK to undergo major organ transplants. The Air Alliance Express service has been in operation since 23 April 2018. Given the capacity constraints on the Air Corps, it would not be possible for it to deliver the requirements sought by the HSE. I confirm that my Department did not tender for the service. I have outlined to the Deputy and other Members the constraints and issues within the Air Corps, including the retention of pilots. I have addressed on numerous occasions in the House the pathway we are taking to address the issues within the Air Corps. This will involve the Public Service Pay Commission.We have made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Service Pay Commission regarding pilot retention.

We do not want to see any gap in service, but at some stage the Defence Forces must have a capability to deliver and be an aid for the civil power. This is a €7 million contract over two years. In a response to a parliamentary question in 2014, I was told that the costs of providing this service by the Air Corps would have been approximately €1.3 million. There is no logic to continuing to look to the private sector. We should look to invest in the Air Corps and increase its ability to deliver this service. When I visited Baldonnel, I spoke to members of the Air Corps who were eager to deliver and to help and be an aid to the civil power in the context of air ambulance transports. They would like to be able to extend the service they currently give during daytime. However, there seems to be no urgency to increase the capacity to deal with the issues where it seems impossible for the Air Corps to retain staff or attract the experts who will help deliver such as service into the future.

We also have a service level agreement with the HSE. As with other areas of the public service, there have been challenges in recruitment and retention of personnel, particularly in areas of expertise such as air traffic controllers and pilots. Retirements of highly experienced Air Corps personnel are exceeding the number of replacement personnel being recruited and trained. The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the private sector. Pilots are much sought after in the private sector and are being offered attractive remuneration. Significant work is under way within the defence bodies and in the Department aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps. A return to previous capacity levels will be gradual. I would love it if we were able to meet all of the requests made under the service level agreement. I met the Minister for Health and the HSE management on this. We have given them plenty of warning about the challenges we face.

The main overseas missions on which Defence Forces personnel are deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 376 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in Syria with 137 personnel. On UNDOF, approximately 130 Defence Forces personnel are currently based in Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation. An additional eight personnel are based in UNDOF headquarters in Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation. The planned phase 3 of the UN's intended redeployment of the mission to its full mission area, including to the Syrian side of the area of separation, is anticipated by September 2018. This involves a full return of military personnel, including the Irish contingent, to Camp Faouar. The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment and on 22 May 2018 the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNIFIL for a further 12 months. Irish troops are serving as part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion in UNIFIL. Since May 2015, the Finnish contingent has included an Estonian platoon comprising 36 personnel. Both Finland and Estonia will withdraw from the Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL on 31 December 2018. I am currently considering the option to temporarily replace the Finnish contingent by increasing Ireland's contribution to UNIFIL for a 12-month period - up to November 2019 - while we source an alternative partner. The Naval Service vessel LÉ Samuel Beckett is currently deployed as part of Operation Sophia, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, operation in the Mediterranean. It will be replaced by LÉ James Joyce in July. The Naval Service will deploy for a period of approximately 30 weeks in total to this mission in 2018.   Other missions on which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU training mission in Mali, EUTM, with 20 personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with five personnel and the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo with 12 personnel. Ireland also contributes observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU, NATO - Partnership for Peace and OSCE headquarters. There are no planned changes to our continued participation in these missions at this time.

It is important that we recognise the 60 years of international peacekeeping work that Ireland has contributed. On Syria, does the Minister of State expect all troops to return to camp this year? Will the Minister of State specifically outline the improvements that have happened to authorise this return and what has underpinned that? Estonia and Finland are removing their troops from the Lebanon mission. Will the Minister of State explain why they have made that decision and what countries he expects to partner with Ireland? Can he update the House on the negotiations regarding future partnership countries with Ireland in the UN mission in Lebanon? The Minister of State mentioned a specific amount but does he anticipate that it might be greater in future? Will he outline which countries might join us there?

Pending the full return of UNDOF to the area of separation, the mission has continued to maintain a credible presence in the Golan Heights in line with its mandate. The Deputy Chief of Staff of Operations, Major General Kieran Brennan, has visited the Syrian side of the UNDOF operation. With the completion of phase 3, which included medevac and providing safety in the camp, ensuring we have the correct facilities in the Camp Faouar, we agreed to return. I expect that this will happen in September but that depends on ensuring that everything goes okay. In the context of UNIFIL, the Defence Forces were serving as a joint battalion with the Finns and Estonians, who have pulled back for their own reasons and who are reducing their numbers on the mission. I hope that we will backfill for 12 months and that we will then get a new partner. I anticipate that this will be the Czech Republic and I have spoken to its Prime Minister and Chief of Staff in that regard.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	258	I assume there will be further safety checks in Syria before the mission is authorised. Will the Minister of State confirm this? Will he outline who has had meetings with representatives from the Czech Republic? The Minister of State did not clarify why the Finnish and Estonian missions were pulled back. How advanced are the discussions regarding the Czech Republic partnering with Ireland on this specific UN mission?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	259	The initial phase of the incremental return to the mission to Camp Faouar was completed in September 2016 and further deployment took place during 2017 so we have a number of troops there.This involved the deployment of a Nepalese mechanised infantry company and elements of the force headquarters staff, including eight Irish Defence Forces officers. As I said, it is anticipated that the relocation of Irish personnel will be completed in September 2018 as further checks and balances are carried out to make sure our troops are safe. As I have stated I am not sure of the exact reasons but, for their own personal reasons, the Finns and the Estonians have pulled out. I understand they have other missions in Africa. As with ourselves, perhaps they are pulling out because of numbers. It may be because of challenges in their own home countries. They have not pulled out as a result of any particular grievance against the UN mission or anything like that. I spoke to the Czech Minister at a recent European Council meeting. My officials are in contact with her officials in that regard. I also spoke to the Czech Chief of Staff when I was in the company of my own Chief of Staff at a recent overseas mission. The Czech Republic is looking at this very seriously. I understand and know that it cannot accommodate us during 2018, but it definitely will towards the end of 2019. That is one of the reasons we are going to backfill in 2019.

He made very serious allegations as to how his health was compromised in that period and as to how he was victimised as a consequence of the resulting bouts of sickness. What action did the Minister of State take on foot of that disclosure?

Therefore it is not possible for me to go into detail on any actions being taken on foot of any individual disclosure so as to ensure that such individuals' confidentiality is not breached. However, as I have previously stated in the House, the health and welfare of the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann are a priority for the Department, the Defence Forces and me. I am fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and to the protections contained in that Act. To this end I want to ensure that those making protected disclosures are reassured that, where such disclosures are made in accordance with the legislation, they are and will continue to be dealt with in a thorough and fair manner. I have made it clear to my Department and the Defence Forces that the protections of the Act must be afforded to those who make qualifying disclosures under the Act.

It does not preclude him from doing as he did in the past when this House was made aware of other whistleblowers. He met them and dealt with an independent assessor who also met them. In this case, has the Minister of State contacted the person who made the disclosure? Has he had any communications with the person in question other than to acknowledge receipt of his disclosure? Did he make the assessor aware of the case? This man had major complications and major problems within the Defence Forces and the Air Corps. He was doused with chemicals such as greases, oils and even aircraft fuel. When he complained to the doctors he was told to suck it up, to get back into his uniform and to get on with it or he was called a malingerer or a bluffer. He had to attend a private doctor. He was exposed to chemicals such as trichloroethylene, Ardrox 666, MEK and other chemicals. I am sure the Minister of State is aware, as this man says it in his disclosure, that it was around this time that he began to become sick with symptoms such as diarrhoea, tremors and anxiety. Is the Minister of State aware, or has he taken any action to find out, whether he was victimised and put onto dirty duties such as raking grass and cleaning stairwells and offices using the very chemicals which were affecting his health? The Minister of State is not precluded because I have not identified the person in question. He is not precluded from saying that he received the disclosure, that he has contacted the person and that it is being dealt with. The Minister of State has had this disclosure for a long time and there does not seem to be any movement on it.

That is clearly set out in the Act. All protected disclosures which I receive or which are received into my Department are treated as having the utmost importance and go through a clear process within my Department and in respect of all other parties involved. As the Deputy knows, there are a number of legal complexities around all protected disclosures made. There are no clear-cut answers to most of them. The Deputy spoke about some of the chemicals being used in the Air Corps. I am at liberty to say that there have previously been some historical parliamentary questions in the Chamber, to which I have replied. I have outlined to all Deputies within the House that I appointed an independent person. I have been in contact with other people who have previously made protected disclosures. I am now seeking legal advice on the best way forward in respect of issues around chemicals and the Air Corps.

He states that he is due maritime patrol duty moneys from 2009 to 2015. Most other personnel have gotten this reinstated but he has not. I ask the Minister of State to progress that claim without me identifying the person or giving anything else about his identity away. I have permission to give that identity. Perhaps I will do that at another stage. If that alone was done, it might help alleviate the dire circumstances this very ill man is in. I ask the Minister of State, at the very least, to look at that.

I have no issue with that whatsoever. I will look into that for the Deputy. If the Deputy wants to write to me on that issue, and if he has the permission of the person in question to do so, I have no issue whatsoever in providing a full reply on that specific issue. The Deputy will have to write to me on it, however. I am not going into the contents of the protected disclosure made by this person. It would be totally inappropriate for me to go into the detail of any protected disclosure. I reassure all Members of this House that my Department, the Defence Forces and myself treat all protected disclosures with absolute urgency and that we take every opportunity to deal with them.

Will he make a statement on the matter?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	267	The next EU multi-annual Financial framework, MFF, will determine the budget spending for the EU for the period from 2021 to 2027.  On 2 May 2018, the European Commission presented its EU budget proposals for the multi-annual financial framework. Included in this, the Commission proposed that a budget of €13 billion over the 7 year period be dedicated to the European defence fund - €4.1 billion to defence research and €8.9 billion to the development of defence capabilities.There are links between the European Defence Fund and PESCO projects. A project that qualifies for co-funding under the capability window of the defence fund and is also a PESCO project will receive an additional 10% funding under PESCO. The PESCO projects where Ireland has confirmed our participation relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations and for domestic operations. Maritime surveillance enhancement will assist the Naval Service in developing capability and capacity both for overseas and domestic operations. The Training Mission Competence Centre will support Ireland's engagement in missions such as the training mission in Mali. It is envisaged that the European Defence Fund will promote co-operation and cost savings among member states. By pooling resources, it is proposed that individual member states can achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own. The fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The fund will co-ordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence. Collaborative projects with significant cross-border participation by small and medium-sized enterprises will be particularly encouraged. This will ensure that the fund remains open to recipients from all member states, regardless of their size and location in the Union. The MFF process is at a very early stage. The allocation of resources across all of the various EU sectoral funds will be considered in the context of the eventual total agreed budget for the EU.

Who attended representing the Irish Government? I understand it was agreed yesterday to establish a co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD. The review of defence spending by the European Defence Agency covers individual member states. The aim is to provide an overview of national defence plans. Can the Minister of State confirm that Ireland's defence spending will be monitored under this new system? Can he confirm that the reviewers can put proposals to the Irish Government and State? Can he confirm that the proposals will be binding? I believed we had the troika out of this place a couple of years back but now we see European monitoring bodies, such as the one in question, making recommendations that I understand are binding in respect of defence expenditure in this State. The Minister of State might confirm that.

The Deputy has now seen two budgets going through this House. He has an opportunity to vote on all the budget outcomes. It is up to each Member of this House to do so. It is a matter for the Government to bring forward a budget. If the Government wants to spend a certain amount, be it on agriculture, enterprise, arts and heritage, defence, justice or education, it is a matter for it. As with all budgets, all proposals are passed by the House. I was unable to attend the Council meetings of yesterday and today because of parliamentary questions. It is quite difficult to change the schedule for parliamentary questions. My Secretary General, Mr. Maurice Quinn, and the assistant secretary with responsibility in this area had a joint meeting with representatives of the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade. The Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, attended with his officials. I will be getting a full briefing on the outcome of the meetings yesterday and today upon their return.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	270	The Minister of State might tell us what happens if CARD makes a recommendation on increasing defence expenditure in this or that area in this State and the State, Government or this House does not accept it. Could the Minister of State please clarify the position? What is agreed in these proposals is European Defence Fund expenditure of €13 billion over seven years. That is not a doubling, trebling or quadrupling; it is a 22-times increase in European defence spending. It requires Ireland to increase expenditure from 0.5% to 2% under the PESCO proposals, in other words from €905 million to €3.62 billion. We have a homelessness and housing emergency. How many houses would the money build? How many child care workers would it provide? If a house costs €150,000 to build, which is probably the absolute minimum, the money would build 24,000 homes. Does the Minister of State believe that what is being done represents the best allocation of resources available to the State?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	271	Decisions on spending are and will always be a matter for the Dáil. Dáil votes will determine how Ireland spends its money on defence, as I stated to the Deputy a while ago. Deputy Barry and many like him with similar views on defence come into the House and give out about what we spend on equipment and defence matters. If something happened to people overseas, whether they were killed or badly injured, the Deputy would be the first person breaking in the door here, jumping up and down, as he did earlier, and doing a jig on the floor looking for an explanation as to why we were not spending and allocating resources. I have no issue whatsoever defending every penny we spend on our Defence Forces' members and equipment. It is like somebody coming in here today saying that in Operation Sophia we gave migrants over to the Libyan coastguard. The individual concerned had hardly got an explanation when he was gone. He said he got a reply to a question on it. It could not be further from the truth. His line and Deputy Barry's line suited their left-wing agenda. I want Deputy Barry to think about this. I will defend every penny spent on equipment for members of the Defence Forces because their safety is my priority.

Are sufficient procedures in place to ensure this prevails?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	273	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 45, 51, 53 and 58 together. As of 30 May 2018, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 9,010 personnel – whole-time equivalents – of which 589 were females. Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new and the Permanent Defence Force has always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service. This is a feature of military organisations internationally as well as in the Defence Forces. The overall numbers departing the Permanent Defence Force in recent years are broadly consistent with the long-term trend, with some exceptions. As the Deputy will be aware, under my direction the Department brought the issue of recruitment and retention of certain specialists to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission. Initial data have been submitted and further data and information on the defence sector will be forwarded in the coming weeks. To address vacancies in specialist positions, I have initiated a full range of actions, including developing proposals for the re-entry of suitably qualified former members of the Permanent Defence Force to fill appointments and for expanding direct entry for suitable posts. Work on these matters is ongoing. The White Paper on Defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces. The recruitment plan proposed by the Defence Forces envisages 800 new entrants being inducted across all services and competition streams in 2018.Similar to other areas in the public service, the Defence Forces must compete with the private sector for applicants. It is too early at this juncture to give precise targets for recruitment in 2019 but I expect them to be broadly in line with this year. The pay of the Defence Forces is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The pay of a newly qualified three-star private has increased by 25% in the past 12 months. At €27,257, it is favourable when compared with entry rates across the public service. The starting rate for newly qualified officers is €35,000 and for new graduate officers in excess of €40,000. These amounts are inclusive of military service allowance. This compares favourably with the average starting pay for graduates across other sectors of employment. The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces, as well as the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activity. This is underlined by a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. Several specific initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces. These include targeting of female persons in online recruitment campaigns, the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants etc. Over the lifetime of the White Paper, further projects will be progressed to ensure increased female participation in the Defence Forces continues. I remain committed to ensuring the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles required of them by Government at home and overseas.

To what extent do the present numbers reflect the status quo in this regard? Are there particular sectors of the Defence Forces in which it has been found particularly difficult to attract female recruits?

This is specifically referenced by the commission in paragraph 6.13 of its report. Section 3 of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides that the Public Service Pay Commission be requested to complete a comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors, as well as employment streams identified in the report. It is an ongoing programme of human resources development within the defence organisation, part of which is aimed at ensuring an appropriate work-life balance. The Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters in the Defence Forces to this end. I have commenced several initiatives ranging from the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the defence organisation. I have almost concluded the bringing forward of measures to allow former members of the Defence Forces with specialist skills, such as pilots and engineers, to re-enter the Defence Forces. I will be looking at extending that to former enlisted personnel.

Would it be possible to over-recruit, by way of compensation, during recruitment drives? Will the Minister of State indicate whether this has been tried out? Defence is a sensitive area and it is never known when or how the Defence Forces may be called upon in an emergency. Is he satisfied that sufficient strength remains available for the Defence Forces and the Reserve Defence Force to be deployed at short notice?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	277	Several specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces. These include the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants; special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment; a balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards; all promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit; a gender adviser has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. As in the White Paper, the Department of Defence recognised the requirement to develop a diversity and inclusion strategy. This, together with the associate action plan, has been achieved. We target specific organisations, such as camogie and ladies football teams, to get women into the organisation. There used to be recruitment once a year. Last year, I brought in two phases for recruitment in the first part and then the second part of the year. It was unfair for people to apply to join the Defence Forces in February only to be left on a list for 14 months and then, by the time they were reached on the panel, they had moved on to further employment. Now, we have recruitment in two months of the year. I am seriously examining over-recruitment to ensure there is a cushion available. During Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, we were able to get members of the Defence Forces on the streets quickly and they were able to do an outstanding job at short notice.

I have a big problem with boosting military expenditure at the behest of the European Union to bolster the military-industrial complex and arms manufacturers in Europe. I would be quite happy, however, to see money spent on soldiers and their families to give them a decent wage and livelihood in order that they do not have to depend on family income supplement. Up to 25% of the Defence Forces have to take up family income supplement, forcing their families to go out protesting. That is at the root of the significant recruitment and retention difficulties, resulting in the Defence Forces being way below strength. Health and safety has been compromised because of the exodus of experienced personnel from the Air Corps, the Army and the Naval Service. It all comes down to low levels of pay, as well as poor conditions of accommodation, food and other factors which are a result of the Government not putting investment into the soldiers. Will the Minister of State give us the figures for the last recruitment drive? How many people were actually recruited? I know 3,000 expressed an interest, 381 went as far as being processed and only 180 were called. How many people were actually recruited?

I have addressed this matter until I am blue in the face. The only place where these accusations come from is from the left. Other Members have taken on board what I have stated on this before. I went to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection myself to check the figures. I ask the Deputy to believe me when I say that. When it is stated that so many members of the defence organisation are in receipt of family income supplement, that figure includes members of the Department as well. The Deputy knows the meaning of family income supplement. One could be on €50,000 a year but, if one has 15 children, one is entitled to family income supplement. It is an income supplement that depends on the circumstances of a family.The Deputy talks about the working family payment. He really should consider the meaning of the payment and what it is all about. I do not have them to hand here but I will come back to him with the full figures for the applications we received during the last intake

We are far from a priority when it comes to the welfare of our troops, their wages, their conditions, their health.Another member talks about the fact that he earned approximately €150 per week more between 2005 and 2007, when he was able to get a mortgage, than he earns today. This is the reality, and this is why the Department is unable to recruit and retain people and they are flooding out of the Defence Forces. The Department buys new naval vessels but does not have the personnel to put on them, so the vessels go out to sea but I hear reports that they then cannot do the fisheries patrols because they do not have enough personnel to board ships. The Department is buying new CASA airplanes, but I understand there are only three CASA pilots, some of whom may even leave, yet it takes years to train these pilots. Where will we get the pilots to fly the planes? It is interesting the Minister of State does not have the figures for the result of the recruitment drive. There are all these expressions of interest, but then they decrease to a tiny number because the applicants discover what the pay and conditions are and will not touch the positions with a bargepole.

Had he asked me for the specific figures, I would have had them to hand, but he did not ask that specific question. He does not have to table another question; I will come back to him with that information. We have issues with pilot retention, air traffic controllers and engineers, and I am taking steps to address all these issues by ensuring direct entry and re-entry of personnel. People who left the organisation want to re-enter it, and they will improve the skills reserve of the Defence Forces. I am working with the Department and the Defence Forces on this issue. I will defend everything we spend on defence equipment. The Deputy specifically highlighted naval vessels. Members of the Defence Forces deserve the best equipment to carry out their day-to-day duties.

We are failing abysmally against the international metric. The total of females in our Defence Forces is approximately 6.5%, which is way below international norms. The figure for the US is 16%; New Zealand, 17%; Canada, 15%; and Britain, 9%. Female participation in the Air Corps specifically is below 5% while it is approximately 7% in the Army and the Navy. According to figures received by my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, there was a 9.7% female recruitment rate last year within the Defence Forces, which does not even match the norms in the countries I have mentioned. Clearly, therefore, we need a greater recruitment initiative which involves more than just contacting the GAA or other sports clubs. We need to do more to increase female participation because this will have a drag effect if we want to try to increase the percentage in years to come. A 9.7% rate last year is not good enough. We should seek at the very least to match international norms in respect of recruitment in order that we increase the number of females in the Defence Forces.

Women's websites and magazines are targeted. I just mentioned sports clubs and organisations as examples. I agree that it is difficult to attract women to the Defence Forces. We must change the mindset. I am not sure why women might think a career in the Defence Forces is not an attractive future for them. We must help to change this. I have spoken to the Chief of Staff and the general staff about this. We have discussed using the women within the organisation to promote the organisation, whether through visits to third level or second level institutions, and giving them every opportunity in order that women are well aware that the Defence Forces are an attractive place to work. This will be difficult but we will continue to do it. Female inductions in the cadets increased by 13% in 2017 and is down 1% in 2018. The 2017 numbers were up on the 2016 numbers, and I hope the final figures for 2018 will be up on 2017.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	290	I accept the Department has implemented some initiatives. They have not worked, and I am glad the Minister of State has recognised that. One constructive suggestion I have concerns something the British army does. It has changed its recruitment portal and the way in which the recruitment process works. I know many people who have applied to the Defence Forces and who received an email seeking to confirm their acceptance of their applications to the Defence Forces. A centralised portal is needed. The UK uses a buddy system whereby someone within the force works with the people as they apply. Many people are just waiting for an email signalling acceptance or whether the application has been successful. A centralised portal would help facilitate increased recruitment or give people certainty regarding their applications. The Defence Forces should not use email as a means to determine whether someone has been successful in his or her application. The technology for the recruitment process needs to be modernised in order that there is greater certainty for potential applicants, and the Minister of State should examine what is done in the UK. It has helped many applicants. I know Irish people who have applied to the British army and say it is a much better system of recruitment.

However, I have looked at the British system and a private company does a lot of the recruitment for the British army. This year, 15% of the applications for the cadets have been from females. If my memory serves me correctly, the figure for general service recruitment for females was 13%. However, the Deputy is correct that we must change our recruitment methods. My officials and I are looking at the various systems overseas. We must learn from other countries whether we need a centralised system and whether there should be departmental involvement. We must look seriously at this. We must change the way we recruit, which is what the Deputy is talking about, and that is the way I see it happening. We must look at changing the system we have. This is one of the reasons I am looking at direct entry and re-entry and the two-phase recruitment during the year. I was not happy with one recruitment drive each year. Two-phase recruitment presents better opportunities for people. They do not have to wait around for as long to be part of that. A significant number of people, whether well educated or less educated, have different contributions to make to the Defence Forces. If there are people out there who want to apply to the Defence Forces, I encourage them to do so because they ought to have something to offer to the organisation.

The meeting was hosted by Bulgaria, which currently holds the Presidency of the EU. There were two working sessions over the course of the meeting which was chaired by the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini. The two sessions dealt with a range of ongoing developments in regard to EU Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, specifically aspects of PESCO and a discussion on perspectives on crisis management.  The PESCO session involved a discussion on the implementation of PESCO and the governance rules for PESCO projects. It was clear at this session that the focus should and will be on positive outcomes for the people of Europe. The work ahead to implement PESCO focuses on the governance arrangements, third country participation and achieving real deliverables through the projects. The discussion on crisis management reflected on the current security challenges and the role of the EU in support of international peace and security. This session was attended by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping and the NATO Deputy Secretary General. This facilitated a reflection on operational co-operation and mutual support between the EU, the UN and NATO, both at the strategic level and also on the ground where units or contingents from each organisation may be deployed in the same theatre of operations. I welcome the process under way to review the long-standing and important UN-EU Strategic Partnership on Peacekeeping and Crisis Management. I look forward to close engagement with my EU ministerial colleagues in regard to that. Ireland is committed to the development of EU capabilities in the area of crisis management in support of the UN and to enhancing EU-UN co-operation. Ireland is an active participant in all aspects of CSDP, both civilian and military. We endorse the position that crisis management operations are most effective when part of a wider approach, linking up with diplomacy, development and rule of law instruments. Discussions during this session were constructive and inclusive.En marge of the meeting, I met with Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General primarily in regard to UNIFIL and UNDOF, and separately with my UK, Czech and Cypriot colleagues. While in Sofia, I also attended a meeting of the European Defence Agency steering board.

At the press conference, Federica Mogherini spoke about how the EU defence package this year entered real implementation and of 17 projects under Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, that are now up and running. Will the Minister of State outline Ireland's position regarding those 17 projects? Ms Mogherini also said that a number of countries had advanced ideas for new PESCO projects. Was Ireland one of those countries? Can the Minister of State elaborate on those projects and the ideas that were advanced? What is his opinion on the discussion regarding potential PESCO projects? Also, the multi-annual financial framework was mentioned, with an explicit heading for defence, and that there will be an off-budget instrument for defence works. Can the Minister of State outline the position on that in an Irish context?

The benchmarks are for the EU as a whole rather than for individual member states; increased co-operation in cyber defence; develop a database of available and deployable capabilities such as what we do currently with the United Nations; participate in at least one project under PESCO; and use the European Defence Agency, EDA, as a forum for joint capability development. As the Deputy stated, there are 17 projects that range from the European medical command, European secure software defined radio, the network of logistic hubs, military mobility, the European Union Training Mission Competence Centre, the European training certification centre for European armies, the energy operational function, the deployable military disaster relief capabilities package, the maritime systems for mine countermeasures, harbour and marine surveillance and protection, upgrade of maritime surveillance, cyber threats, cyber rapid response, strategic command and control, armoured infantry fighting vehicles, indirect fire support and crisis response agencies. We are signed up to two of those projects already, namely, the European agency on training mission competence and the upgrade of maritime surveillance.

What view did the Minister of State take in terms of an Irish context and were any changes mooted? I know this is an informal meeting where decisions are not taken but was anything suggested as being worthy of a decision at a formal meeting and can the Minister of State outline when that might happen?

There were no decisions taken at that meeting, as the Deputy stated. It was more for the participation of NATO member states rather than Ireland's participation because of our term of neutrality.

A Programme for a Partnership Government also includes a commitment to develop this institute. It is foreseen that the new institute would have international standing and contribute to the overall development of knowledge and experience in the areas of peace support, leadership and conflict resolution. Scoping work was carried out on the proposal throughout 2016. A concept paper was developed and some initial consultations took place with national and international third level and research institutes, as well as potential philanthropic contributors. Arising from this, it was decided to conduct a formal feasibility study. Following a tender process in 2017, a contract was awarded to a consultancy body to complete this study. Work on the study commenced in January 2018 and an interim report is expected in July. This interim report will inform the next steps to be taken.

This is an issue we mentioned as a party in 2013 and my colleague, the current Ceann Comhaire, sought to have it progressed. I am concerned that there was a two-year period during which this was a scoping exercise and now it is a feasibility study. Is that an indication that there is significant doubt within the Department of Defence towards progressing it? It is moving at a very slow pace and I would like to believe it will be progressed at a quicker pace. That is important. We saw Kofi Annan launch a new peacekeeping training centre in China recently. They are trying to develop an expertise around cyber security. In an Irish context we have the Government's policy on foreign direct investment, FDI, the progression on data centres and technology control around peacekeeping but also developing the intelligence expertise in a particular centre to address serious safety issues in terms of cyber security that will threaten companies but also the State itself. We need to be looking at developing a model of expertise that can become international best practice. We need to move beyond feasibility studies and I would like to see a more defined proposal from the Minister of State and his Department.

Therefore, in order to identify and leverage Ireland's unique selling points, for example, our neutrality and the Northern Ireland peace process, I felt it appropriate when I was appointed as Minister of State to carry out a detailed evaluation and feasibility study to determine how best to proceed.It is envisaged the study will assist in the validation, development or amendment of the existing concept. The successful development of an institute will require substantial investment of taxpayers' money and must be properly evaluated and planned. On my appointment in 2016, I did not want to go ahead with the peace and leadership institute for it to flop within two years because so many institutes are offering the same thing. That is why I wanted a scoping exercise to find out what kind of leadership courses we could offer that are not already available. Piggy-backing on our expertise in peacekeeping, the peace process in Northern Ireland and in neutrality, we will be able to offer courses in those areas.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	302	When does the Minister of State expect a decision to be made? When will the feasibility study be completed? When will the Minister of State make a decision on it? It is mentioned in the White Paper that work on the concept will be developed over the following 12 months with a view to its initial shape being showcased in 2016. We are now in 2018. The Minister of State has given the reasons for the evaluation, scoping study and feasibility analysis. When will he make a decision on this? It is underpinned by the White Paper. The Minister of State should give a timeline to the House on when he will be in a position to formalise this. It is important in a future defence context for Ireland to develop the expertise. I gave the example of cyber intelligence. The Minister of State mentioned our historic strides in peacekeeping. He needs to make a decision on it and give a timeline for when he will do it instead of having another feasibility study of the evaluations. There will be a cycle of repetition. We need a formal decision.

I want something that is attractive and will be there for years to come. We have to get the expertise of partners involved. When we let this go out to a feasibility study in January 2018 we asked the company to interact with the Department, the Defence Forces and education organisations, including universities, institutes of technologies and other peace and leadership institutes. We asked for an examination of what they were offering and what could make us different from and more attractive than them. The people I spoke to said there is a huge amount of work involved in this. It is not just about building the building, bringing people in from overseas and talking about Ireland's neutrality or how great we are at peacekeeping overseas. We are outstanding but we have to look beyond that. We have to look at ten or 15 years down the road instead of three or five years down the road.

This will remove the blanket exclusion of An Garda Síochána and members of the Defence Forces from its scope. It will be subject to the application of the appropriate exclusions or derogations permitted by EU Directive No. 2003/88/EC. Work is under way in the Departments of Defence and Employment Affairs and Social Protection on this decision. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the Working Time Directive can be applied to members of the Defence Forces. I will amend the Defence Force regulations, as required, to facilitate this process. I recently signed an amendment to Defence Forces regulation A11 dealing with leave. This amendment increases to four working weeks from 19 days the amount of carry-over leave allowed to members of the Permanent Defence Force in circumstances where the member could not take annual leave as a result of being on certified sick leave, adoptive leave or maternity leave. My Department will also engage, through the conciliation and arbitration process, with the Defence Forces representative associations to discuss the application of the provisions of the Working Time Directive to the Defence Forces. However, this can be constrained if litigation is being pursued. Litigation taken by a member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of the applicability of certain elements of the Working Time Directive to the Defence Forces was settled recently in the High Court having regard to the specific circumstances of that case. Further litigation on the Working Time Directive as it relates to the Defence Forces is pending. For these reasons it would not be appropriate to comment further.

Both PDFORRA and RACO have made estimates of the number of annual leave days lost in 2016. PDFORRA said its members lost up to 37,000 days of annual leave. RACO said its members lost nearly ten annual leave days in the same year. Will retrospective payment or recognition of the days lost require a supplementary budget? Has the Minister of State made the Minister for Finance aware that, based on the findings of the court case, there is a need for a supplementary budget to address the outstanding days leave that have been lost? What action will the Minister of State take? When will the defence regulations the Minister of State signed or will sign take effect?

There was no court ruling made on the wider issue of the claim given the settlement reached by parties. The facts of the case were not opened to the court. Decisions to change the legislative part of the working time directive were not made on foot of this court case. It has been under way in the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Defence for quite some time. Work is being undertaken. The Department and the Defence Forces are working together on this. My Department has met officials from the representative associations recently. They will continue with their meetings.

The Department was well aware of it and the 11 subsequent cases that are still ongoing. They have a bearing on it. I am asking the Minister of State if at all possible to address the other potential court cases - there are 36,000 annual leave days unaccounted for in this way - with a supplementary budget or some other mechanisms that will address it once and for all rather than having it hanging over us again next year.

Elaine Loughlin, writing in the Irish Examiner on 16 June, reported:A scheme to help young people deal with mental health issues is being “blocked” by the Department of Public Expenditure, it can be revealed.Four departments have agreed on how to fund and run a new coordinated “pathfinder” programme for young people with mental health problems. However, it is being held up by Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe’s department.The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, is quoted as saying, “A timeline to full implementation cannot yet be agreed as the participating departments have not received final approval from [the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform]”. I received word today that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, was not going to take this question and had passed it back to the Department of Health. I do not understand that because the question is very clear and concise. It is directed towards the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and asks why it is not approving the programme. I do not understand the rationale for the Minister and his Department deciding they were not going to deal with it. I do not understand how the Department of Health can answer the question on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I note that the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health is also not present. Pathfinder is a hugely important programme but it is sitting there, undelivered. Did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform explain to the Minister of State who is present today why it was not taking the question? Has it decided that mental health is not important enough for it? Did it even read the question or did its officials just see an issue dealing with health and decide to kick it back? It is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which needs to answer the question as to why this programme is being held up. Is it that the Department is too embarrassed at the Government's failure to protect children and young people by making these programmes available? It appears as though the bean counters in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are saying that children and young people are simply not a priority. We have seen the consequences of Departments failing to work together in the past. The pathfinder programme sets out a clear way the Departments will work together as they want to. There is a clear plan and structure but it is not being given the funding necessary to deliver. Why is that? We have over 6,000 children on primary care psychology appointment waiting lists and 2,500 children waiting for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. In the south east, as indicated by the Ombudsman for Children at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care last week, CAMHS is imploding because its psychiatrists are all resigning. We have more than 4,000 children with disabilities waiting for their statutory entitlement to an assessment under the Disability Act and almost 6,000 children and adolescents have been waiting for more than a year for occupational therapy assessment. We have more than 10,000 waiting for more than 18 months for hospital outpatient appointments and we are heading towards 4,000 homeless children. It appears that the Government has an issue in prioritising children and young people and the pathfinder programme is a clear example of that. Good policies are being put in place, including by the Minister of State present, but it appears that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not putting the proper funding behind many of them. The Department and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, should have been here to address this issue today as it is that Department which is holding up the pathfinder programme, not the Department of Health or the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	311	I thank Deputy Browne for raising this important issue and for his question on the progress of establishing the youth mental health pathfinder unit. Following Civil Service Management Board and ministerial approval, the establishment of the pathfinder unit is a mental health priority for 2018 for the Department of Health. The motivation for the model comes from an analysis that no single Department or Government agency has the key to all of the policy responses required to address the issues around youth mental health in Ireland. The remit of the pathfinder unit is to identify youth mental health priorities and objectives, developing policy to give effect to those priorities and objectives and engaging with Departments, Government agencies and non-government organisations to achieve the most effective means of implementing these policies. The proposed model has three key elements: a cross-governmental unit staffed through secondments from participating Departments to operate for an initial three-year period; a pooled budget to drive change; and shared accountability at Secretary General level across sponsoring Departments. Membership will be drawn from participating Departments including the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach. It is proposed to utilise section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 to enable a new collaborative model of working across Government. As this will be the first time this legislative provision has been used, a significant amount of work is required to design a robust and workable model for this new arrangement. Officials from the Department of Health, as the lead Department, have been working in co-operation with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over a period to meet all the administrative, budgetary, governance and legal challenges that need to be addressed in developing this innovative model. I am informed that the next meeting of officials from both Departments is scheduled in the coming days. This model has been approved by the sponsoring Secretaries General and the Civil Service Management Board, which is made up of all Secretaries General and heads of offices. It has also been approved to further some of the recommendations of the national task force on youth mental health, including taking a lead in formalising mechanisms to ensure that the voices of young people are fully considered in the development and implementation of legislation, policy and services for youth. The pathfinder team should develop mandatory protocols, which will work to safeguard young people against potential changes in policy that could negatively impact on youth mental health. It will also carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in respect of youth mental health to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater co-ordination. In conclusion, the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, together with other participating Departments, continue their ongoing collaboration in delivering this new, innovative and complex project and I look forward to following the development of this positive interdepartmental proposal.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	312	In its key message, the final report of the youth mental health pathfinder project states that urgent action is required on youth mental health in Ireland. It states that evidence shows the majority of children and young people in Ireland are highly resilient but suicide and self-harm rates among our children and young people are extremely high by international standards. The rate for young men is the third highest in the EU and the rate for young women is the highest in the EU. It states that Connecting for Life, the national suicide reduction strategy, prioritised young people but is insufficiently clear about how, when or where to take action and by whom and a sift of the evidence shows we are not serving children and young people well enough. The Minister of State said the motivation for the model came from analysis that no single Department or Government agency has the key to all of the policy responses required to address the issues around youth mental health in Ireland. That is true and it is clear from the pathfinder report. The Minister of State also noted that the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, together with other participating Departments, were continuing their ongoing collaboration in delivering this new innovative complex project. All the other Departments have done their job but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not doing its job. The pathfinder report is dated March 2017 and I understand it was finalised last December but we are now coming into the second half of 2018. I reiterate the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health was reported as saying that a timeline for full implementation cannot yet be agreed as the participating Departments have not received final approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is holding this up and which is not prioritising mental health. That Department and its Minister, Deputy Donohoe, should be here to answer this question today and not the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly or Deputy Finian McGrath. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needs to step up to the mark.

Funding is an issue and we must have and continue to have detailed consultation with young people. I also commit to bring the concerns expressed back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe. The status at the moment, however, is that a cross-Government unit staffed through secondments from participating offices and agencies will operate for a three-year period. It is proposed to recruit a director for the unit. The Department of Health has agreed to fund this post, subject to the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As approval to proceed is still awaited, I take the Deputy's point.  It has also been agreed that the participating Departments will cover the cost of their own seconded staff, subject to approval by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that Departments be allowed to backfill seconded posts. A draft job description for the director has also been prepared. It is also essential that we have a budget to drive change. It is proposed to utilise section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 to create a pooled budget between participating Departments. A draft order, entitled the Public Service Management Act 1997 (section 12) (youth mental health) Order 2018, is in preparation, with an input from the Department of Health legal unit and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, OPC. This is currently being reviewed before being resubmitted to the OPC. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform raised queries - and this is partly a response to the Deputy's concerns - on this approach in December 2017. The Department of Health responded to those queries in January 2018. Further queries were then received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 21 June 2018 and a meeting has been scheduled between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and officials from the Department of Health. We have to focus on this and I will bring these concerns back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and, more importantly, to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

In west Clare, we have not had a psychologist in the community psychiatric service for the past six years and this is putting huge pressure on other aspects of the health services. We only have a half-time equivalent social worker and for the past six weeks, we have not had a consultant psychiatrist. Recruitment of experienced psychiatric nurses is an issue but because of the deficiencies in the membership of the community psychiatric team, clinics regularly have to be cancelled. Emergency cover is often only provided from other sectors. Junior staff are prevented from practising fully in an unsupervised role. As the staff left behind are just burning out, we have a huge deficiency in the membership of our community psychiatric teams. This situation is not unique to Clare. In the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care recently, we heard from Dr. Kieran Moore from County Wexford. He and two of his colleagues are resigning from the psychiatric services in the Wexford area because they find that what they are being asked to do is unsafe and unfair to their patients. Rather than continue to work in an unsafe and unfair manner, they have decided to resign. This is a poor reflection on our psychiatric services and we do know that recruitment and retention is a huge issue right across the health service but particularly in the psychiatric services. Again, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care two weeks ago, we discovered there are 25 different hoops that must be gone through before a member of staff can be recruited. That is before looking for a member of the medical profession to actually take up a post. There must be huge deficiencies in how we are managing recruitment and retention issues. The most common requirement for people in the front-line staff, particularly general practitioners, GPs, is access to counselling and to psychologists. Not every patient with a mental health issue has a biochemical abnormality, yet because talk therapies and counselling are not available and because psychological services to deliver non-medical therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy, occupational therapy and all the other therapies that go to help people who have mental health issues are not available, there is an overreliance on medication.  We heard, again at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, that €400 million is spent on medication in the mental health services and only €10 million is spent on talk therapy, psychological therapy and counselling. Medication obviously has an important part to play but the disparity and imbalance between what we are spending on medication and what we are spending on counselling is unacceptable. Talk therapy and access to psychology and counselling is extremely important yet many of our community psychiatric teams are lacking in those disciplines. We need to have one-to-one therapy with patients. The issue is that there must be continuity of care, there must be one-to-one therapy with people and they must know that they have a person they can contact when they have a problem. What is happening at present is that our services are disjointed, there is no continuity of care and there is no consistency in providing staff. Some areas have excellent recruitment and retention and others have not. I ask the Minister of State how consistency can be brought across the board.

It is essential that we acknowledge the work that many of our colleagues do. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is aware that west Clare has faced difficulties in locating a consultant locum to provide cover for a consultant who began maternity leave on 14 May this year. I accept that point. The good news, though, is that the HSE is confident that a locum consultant will be in place on 9 July. It has informed the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that as an interim measure, the executive clinical director has run two clinics in early June in Kilrush and Ennis and a registrar has continued to provide outpatient reviews. Until the placement of the locum consultant, the executive clinical director will continue to attend a number of clinics. The clinical director is also in regular contact with the staff in Kilrush, providing support as required. The west Clare inpatients in Ennis are being supervised by two other consultants, which will continue until the arrival of the locum. In respect of the broader mental health services and supports, I am glad to say that the local action plan, Connecting for Life Mid-West, was launched in April 2017. This local implementation action plan is based on the same vision, goals, objectives and measurable outcomes as outlined in the national strategy, Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020. Together with identifying the local statutory and non-statutory mental health services and supports in the area, it sets out specific local actions based on the feedback received from a public engagement process in May 2016 and the best available evidence relating to suicidal behaviour.  On a national note, I would like to reiterate that the strengthening of the mental health services is a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and for the Government. The mental health budget has risen from €711 million in 2012 to €912 million in 2018. That is an increase of more than €200 million, or approximately 28%, in six years. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has already secured agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the budget will increase by a further €55 million in 2019. Other positive activity to note in this area includes increased staffing levels, the introduction of new posts, improved seven-days-a-week response and liaison services, as well as continued work on clinical programmes. In April, 10,008 staff were employed in mental health services. Staffing levels in mental health services show an increase of approximately 193 when compared with the April 2017 figure. In excess of 2,000 new posts have been approved since 2012 up to the end of 2017, of which some 1,352 have been recruited or are in the recruitment process. The level of vacancies, the difficulty in recruiting skilled staff and the substantial increase in demand pose a significant challenge. The provision of 136 new primary care psychologists, including 22 basic grade psychologists and 114 assistant psychologists, will, however, help to reduce pressure on these services. We will also provide funding to increase psychiatric nurse undergraduate places by 130 per year by 2021-2022. In the context of an improved seven-days-a-week response and liaison services, the HSE is now in the final stages of recruiting staff required to deliver the 7-7 mental health service cover for the areas that do not currently have such a service in place. In summary, the Irish mental health service faces challenges, including increasing demand for these services and the difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. I am confident, however, that the steps we have taken will ensure that we meet these challenges.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	316	Most of the reply from the Minister of State refers to patching up deficiencies in services, particularly in west Clare. The answer he has given offers only stop-gap solutions. When speaking about recruitment and retention last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, indicated that, in the context of the challenges that are arising, there should be telepsychiatry in the future. In other words, psychiatric services will be delivered to those who need them from a remote site. This is how he intends to deal with the problem. We all know that one-to-one consultation and continuity of care are so important for people with mental health issues. The Minister of State made no mention of the fact that west Clare has not had a psychologist in place for the past six years. This is a huge deficiency in service. The social services in the area are also deficient; we are now down to a half-time equivalent supply. Almost half of the budget increase in the mental health sector this year has been used to employ agency staff. It would appear that the main focus on dealing with the recruitment and retention issue is to employ agency staff. Failing that, the new solution seems to be telemedicine and remote treatment in respect of mental health issues. This is totally unacceptable. The Minister of State mentioned that 2,000 jobs have been approved in the area of mental health services. However, many of those jobs have not been filled and remain vacant. Recruitment and retention are major issues. The problem is that the pay and conditions and the infrastructure are not satisfactory, and there is no support from management. The morale of the service is so low that it is almost impossible to recruit people. Many of our nursing graduates are emigrating en masse once they receive their qualifications. These issues must be addressed.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	317	I take the points made by the Deputy about the Clare region. The locum consultant will be appointed on 9 July. I also agree with the point he made about one-to-one services. It is a very crucial aspect of psychiatry and psychology. I will bring to the Minister's attention the concerns he has raised about the large number of agency staff used by the service. It is important to remember, despite some of the criticisms - and I accept that the Deputy has made genuine, valid points - that the level of vacancies and the difficulty of recruiting skilled staff continues to pose a significant challenge to provision of service. This is particularly the case with child and adult mental health services, CAMHS. That is a sad reality. The provision of 136 primary care psychologists, including 22 basic grade psychologists and 114 psychologists, aims to reduce this pressure. There is an issue about staff, and I accept the points made by the Deputy, but of the 22 basic grade psychologist posts 20 are currently filled. We also face difficulties in recruiting nurses, and the issue of undergraduates as well. I take the points the Deputy has made and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly. If we are investing the money - and the budget is available - we need to ensure that the services are up and running. They must be patient-led and the vision for our psychiatric and mental health services has to be developed in a positive and constructive way. We are committed to doing that.

It is a fantastic village with great potential. There are great facilities there, serving a huge local community. There is a secondary school, shops, pubs, pharmacies, a credit union, an undertaker and two childcare facilities serving a huge community around the area. Right on its doorstep Dell EMC and VMware are major employers. The area has real potential. A new school building is being proposed for Coachford college. However, while the area around Coachford is growing, the village itself is stuck. People cannot get houses. They cannot obtain planning permission or buy houses because it is impossible to get sewer connections. There are two unfinished estates that cannot be built out because the developers cannot get sewer connections. The county council had plans to build social housing which had to be parked because it could not get a sewer connection. One can imagine that the unfinished estates are also attracting unwanted attention. Locals are unable to build in the village itself. They are struggling to get planning in the village and the wider area due to planning restrictions. Even in the village, if one is lucky enough to get planning permission, it is on the condition that a temporary treatment plant is used, which the residents have to pay to maintain. Some residents have been doing this for up to ten years while waiting for the council and Irish Water to put in place services that have not been forthcoming. In the meantime they are being charged development charges and connection fees for a sewer that is not being developed. The need for a sewer in Coachford was recognised. Cork County Council advanced the project; it had Part 8 planning on a site beside the hurling pitch and was discussing outflow pipes with landowners. That was over ten years ago. However, the project did not proceed because of the economic downturn. When Irish Water took over in 2013, it discussed advancing the project as well. It produced various different business cases and continued with planning and design. It has even switched sites and now has planning permission on alternative sites, but it is still stuck with discussing land acquisition and talking to landowners. In 2015, Deputies in government at the time told us that construction would start the following year. Three years later there is no sewer, no contractor has been appointed, and land still has to be purchased. It is easy to imagine the frustration of the people of Coachford. The village has such potential. It has a really active community and it wants to get this project going. In Coachford, the foul water and surface water are mixed together in the network. If there is bad weather and flooding, foul water becomes backed up in the gullies in the village. That is not the only environmental concern here. Coachford is immediately adjacent to the Inniscarra dam, the water supply for Cork city. This matter has been raised repeatedly with the various authorities, but people do not feel that Irish Water has recognised the problem or responded with the necessary urgency. I understand that it is proposed to bundle the Coachford project with a number of other schemes, namely, those in Ballyvourney, Dripsey and Innishannon, so that they can be constructed together. Each scheme is needed. From a social, economic and environmental perspective, Coachford must be released. Will the Minister of State impress the urgent need to address this matter on Irish Water? Will he light a fire under it to get it moving and ensure that the Coachford wastewater scheme becomes a reality?
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	319	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. I thank Deputy Aindrias Moynihan for raising it and for providing me with the opportunity to outline the position on the prioritisation of investment by Irish Water, including in respect of communities such as Coachford, County Cork. I know that part of the world quite well. The Deputy is correct when he says that it is beautiful. Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water service planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level. The primary function of Irish Water is to provide clean, safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment. Irish Water, as a single national utility, is taking a strategic nationwide approach to asset planning and investment.The first ever water services policy statement, prepared in line with the Water Services Acts, which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government launched last month, outlines a clear direction for strategic planning and decision-making on water and wastewater services in Ireland. It identified key policy objectives and priorities for the delivery of water and wastewater services in Ireland over the period up to 2025. The water services policy statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of quality, conservation and future-proofing. It provides the context within which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water will be framed and agreed.  On foot of this water services policy statement, Irish Water's forthcoming strategic funding plan will set out the costs of providing domestic and non-domestic waters services and the recovery of these costs. Subject to the Minister's approval of the strategic funding plan, it will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and will ultimately feed into future annual estimates and the budgetary process.  Irish Water's next investment plan, for the five-year period from 2020 to 2024, will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support its strategic objectives as set out in the water services strategic plan and the forthcoming strategic funding plan to deliver improvements to water services throughout Ireland where they are needed most. Irish Water's water services strategic plan, published in October 2015, sets out a high-level strategy for the next 25 years to ensure the provision of clean, safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection, and support for economic and social development. Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the national planning framework and the national development plan such as those aimed at addressing the needs of smaller communities. Irish Water will work with each local authority to develop these programmes further for inclusion in future funding requirements.  As the Deputy mentioned, in partnership with Cork County Council, Irish Water is currently prioritising a wastewater and sewerage scheme for Coachford, County Cork as part of a wider project that will also involve upgrading infrastructure in Dripsey, Innishannon and Ballyvourney-Ballymakeera. The upgrade will be delivered under a single contract as part of what Irish Water is calling the Cork mid-west sewerage schemes. Upon completion, each of the newly upgraded wastewater treatment plants and associated sewer network will improve treatment, quality and capacity and ensure compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive and Environmental Protection Agency wastewater discharge licensing. Consultations on each location are ongoing, with all landowners on the proposed schemes identified.  I understand from Irish Water that the procurement process for the construction contract is under way. Irish water aims to be in a position to award the construction contract in the first half of 2019. In addition to ongoing negotiations with landowners, Irish Water has undertaken engagement with local elected representatives both in person and via the local representative support desk, and will continue to engage and update on the progress of the project when new information becomes available. In addition, Irish Water representatives have met local community associations and interest groups. This engagement will continue throughout the period of the project.

I understand that the procurement process for the construction contract is under way and that Irish Water is now aiming to be in a position for construction to begin in the first half of 2019. We had false dawns and promises regarding construction in 2016. What is different this time? How confident is the Minister of State that Irish Water will get going on that and begin construction next year? Can he advise what is different from 2016? Furthermore, I refer to the fact that the Coachford scheme is bundled with a number of other schemes. I understand that this is being done to gain efficiencies through economies of scale. However, will delays in other schemes hold back schemes such as this? The local experience of bundling has not been positive. For example, our Garda station in Macroom is bundled with projects in Sligo and Clonmel. Although a site has been available for the past two years, there has been no progress in Macroom because the project is waiting for progress on a site in Sligo. Will bundling these sewerage schemes together and having to deal with a range of different issues cause a delay in any of these schemes? The Coachford and Ballyvourney schemes will have to go through land acquisitions and contested compulsory purchase orders, CPOs. The Minister of State should also bear in mind that those delays are not just delaying the scheme itself. As construction costs go up, delays in the contract will mean a more expensive scheme, which undermines the bundling in the first place. If a scheme is ready to go, can it proceed independently of those with which it is bundled? Could the Coachford scheme move ahead without being held back by any other scheme in the bundle?

Irish Water expects that there will shortly be an announcement on the proposed CPO for the scheme, and the information I have been given is that the contracts will be signed in the first half of 2019. I will endeavour to find the answer to the question on the bundling issue and whether it could have knock-on effects. I understand from what the Deputy has said and from the comments that have been made by Irish Water that the Coachford scheme is at an advanced stage. There seems to be no reason that work could not commence if there were delays in the other areas. I will endeavour to get that particular answer from Irish Water. The company expects that the announcement on CPOs will happen shortly and that this contract will be signed in the first half of 2019.

We have been promised a bypass for a generation or more. Ten years ago three routes for a bypass were proposed and one was selected. We have heard nothing about the bypass since. The general view is that we will not see a bypass of the town in my lifetime. However, there has been some talk of work on an inner relief road proceeding. While it would not answer all of our problems, it would be a significant move forward. In January this year, the county council issued a statement saying that this scheme is important to the economic viability of Thurles and would support the social, recreational and business travel needs of the town and district. Transferring town centre traffic to a purpose-built link road would also have safety benefits, particularly for pedestrians. The project provides for a second bridge crossing over the river Suir within the town environs. A second bridge crossing in the town is key. We are lucky in that we have four superb second level schools in our town, all of which are well attended. During the academic year, the traffic flow in the town is deplorable. Between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., traffic jams are such that it could take an hour to get from one end of the town to the other.  Other towns in our county have been lucky enough to have bypasses. Our town and Tipperary town are the two towns that are suffering from traffic congestion. This link road got a mention in the famous Project Ireland 2040. When will money will be put in place, when exactly will this work commence and when can we hope to see this link road?  Plans are in place for Liberty Square in the centre of the town. Those plans are ongoing at the moment. Additional car parking will be provided. Retail activity in the town has suffered greatly from the traffic congestion. This redevelopment of Liberty Square, which is the centre of Thurles town, is still dependent on the river crossing. Traffic flow will worsen following the redevelopment of the square. Members should not get me wrong. I am not opposed to the redevelopment, because the businesses in Liberty Square have to be given a lifeline. Something had to be done, because the centre of our town was dying.It is essential that the inner relief road is put in place as quickly as possible. I would greatly appreciate a timeline for when the required money will be put in place. In January this year the local authority put down figures for what the inner relief road would cost. In overall Exchequer terms the cost would not be huge as it would be a short inner relief road. As I said, it would not solve all of the difficulties in our town. We had an inner relief road a couple of years ago and it greatly helped the western side of the town. We hope this relief road will do the same, but it is essential. In the 2014 plan we were told that after 2021 discussions would begin on whether this road could proceed. We cannot wait that long. The town is choking with the congestion and we need the road now.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	323	The proposed Thurles inner relief road is a regional and local road project, while the proposed Thurles bypass is a national road scheme. In relation to an inner relief road for Thurles, which I understand would include a second bridge crossing over the Suir, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority and works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The selection and prioritisation of works within its area of responsibility is a matter for the local authority. Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for specific and strategic road improvement grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local roads, including bridges. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling so far short of what was required to maintain the regional and local road network. The current capital plan does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network, but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there continues to be limited scope for funding projects under the specific and strategic grant programmes. Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these grant programmes are assessed by my Department on a case by case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the public spending code and the Department’s capital appraisal framework. The Department has revised the specific and strategic grant appraisal forms and associated guidance documents. A circular on this updated appraisal process issued to all local authorities on 19 April this year. Appraisals received from local authorities relating to road improvements under the regional and local road grant programmes will be evaluated vis-à-vis projects submitted by other local authorities. It is, of course, open to local authorities to advance schemes from their own resources and I understand that Tipperary County Council has been progressing some elements of the proposed inner relief road scheme in that way. As regards a Thurles bypass, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII. Given the many competing projects across the country, TII has to prioritise schemes. The projects included in the national development plan reflect the outcome of TII's prioritisation of projects in the context of the national strategic outcomes in the national planning framework. Unfortunately, the Thurles bypass was not one of the schemes included in the NDP on foot of that process.

In my initial comments I stated we would not see a Thurles bypass in my lifetime and the reply confirms this. With regard to the specific questions I asked about when funding will be made available, the local authority has made it a priority project and advancement of the project is wholly dependent on money being made available from the Department. The retail businesses in the town cannot survive with the congestion there currently. The local authority's estimation of what this would cost is approximately €5.5 million and the lifeline it would give to our town is immense. It is galling that we have such a good rail infrastructure and we are within two miles of a motorway but the traffic congestion in the town is still hampering our development. In the past 30 years our town has seen closure after closure of factories. We consider that one of the major inhibitors to attracting jobs to the town is the congestion. Anyone trying to get from A to B in the morning or evening can lose 45 minutes to an hour getting from one end of the town to the other, which is hard to believe about a provincial town. A second river crossing is absolutely essential. It is very easy to understand why the congestion is there with only one river crossing in place. I implore the Minister to put in place a timeline for funding to be made available to the local authority so it can proceed with this essential infrastructure for Thurles. It is the only obstacle there at present. The local authority has prioritised this as essential infrastructure for Thurles and the economic viability of the town. We need a commitment on a timeframe for the funding.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	325	I am afraid the Deputy is asking me for something I am not willing to give him, and I think he knows that. It is something to which I am unable to commit at this stage. While a limited number of road improvement projects were selected for funding in the Building on Recovery capital plan and in the extra capital plan review allocations, the Thurles inner relief road is not included among the projects identified for development in the period to 2021. Tipperary County Council indicated to the Department a number of years ago that the estimated costs of competing land acquisition, advanced detailed design and the preparation of tender documents for the bridge and road construction stage of the project was in the order of €6.4 million. It is understood that Tipperary County Council has been undertaking some elements of further design work and land acquisition. This is being carried out by the council from its own resources. Tipperary County Council would need to submit an appraisal under the new appraisal process if it wishes to pursue grant funding for the construction of the scheme. In the meantime I must emphasise to the Deputy what I said in the first part of my response, which is very simply that the projects included in the national development plan reflect the outcome of TII's decisions, and the Thurles bypass was not one of the schemes included in the NTP on foot of that process.

As Members are aware, I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle to ask respectfully that all Members exercise a particular level of restraint in the debate. It is important to remember that criminal proceedings are in train in respect of issues that are potentially related to an element of the work of the proposed commission, so nothing should be said here that might in any way jeopardise the rights of those who have come forward and made complaints more recently to have their cases fully prosecuted. Similarly, nothing should be said here this evening that would jeopardise the right of anybody to a fair trial. It is imperative, therefore, that we protect and respect these fundamental constitutional rights. Members are aware that this matter was debated in the Seanad two weeks ago. On 23 November 2016, the then Tánaiste met the survivors of sexual abuse committed by Bill Kenneally. These men, who are fathers, husbands, brothers and sons, had courageously come forward with their evidence of the horrific abuse inflicted on them during their childhood.Their evidence led to a conviction against Bill Kenneally and a sentence of 14 years imprisonment. In their meeting, the victims of Bill Kenneally’s abuse outlined their concerns about how allegations or complaints about their abuser were dealt with at the time that the abuse was taking place. Following the meeting, the then Tánaiste sought the advice of the Attorney General, who advised that while it would be very difficult to establish a commission of investigation, given a number of legal and procedural difficulties, it would not be impossible. The Government was conscious of the very serious allegations that had been made and the concerns of the complainants and accordingly in May 2017 the Government committed to setting up a commission of investigation into the response to allegations of abuse committed by Mr. Bill Kenneally. Since I became Minister for Justice and Equality later that year I, along with my officials, have worked with the Attorney General’s office to draft an appropriate set of terms of reference that, as far as possible, would not affect adversely any pending or ongoing criminal proceedings or further investigations. It should be noted that relatively recently a further 99 criminal charges have been brought against Bill Kenneally in respect of other complainants. An Garda Síochána is also investigating further allegations by new complainants. A commission of investigation is necessary but it cannot supplant or undermine the criminal justice processes under way. The terms of reference are drafted primarily from information provided by survivors of abuse committed by Bill Kenneally. A particular mention should go to Mr. Jason Clancy, who provided very detailed information on the response by the State to the allegations in the 1980s which forms the basis for the commission of investigation. In April this year I met the survivors and their legal representative and offered them an opportunity to comment on the draft terms. They made a number of suggestions, which I considered, and a version encompassing a number of the proposed changes was then sent to the Attorney General for further advice. The final version of the terms of reference was subsequently sent to the survivors via their solicitor who informed my Department that they approved of the terms of reference as now drafted. Turning to the substance of the terms of reference, the sole member will first be asked to investigate the extent of the knowledge within An Garda Síochána during a particular period, 1985 to 1992, of the allegations against Mr. Kenneally. If information emerges indicating that gardaí were informed of the allegations against Mr. Kenneally, either before or after those particular years, then the commission is empowered to investigate that information further. Members will note that the terms contain references to An Garda Síochána, the South Eastern Health Board, Basketball Ireland, the Waterford Catholic diocese and unnamed "political figures". The allegations made by Mr. Clancy and others are primarily against An Garda Síochána but it may be necessary for the commission to investigate the acts or omissions of those other organisations if it can be shown that An Garda Síochána passed information to them relating to offences allegedly being committed by Mr. Kenneally. I am not ruling that out. I inform Members that once the documents were laid before both Houses, my Department made contact with the named organisations, providing them with copies of the terms of reference and informing them that the commission would be in contact with them in due course. I am happy to appoint retired Circuit Court judge, Mr. Barry Hickson, as the sole member of the commission of investigation. A well-respected and experienced jurist, I am sure he will carry out the work of the commission in a professional and expedient manner. Colleagues should also note that the commission may be required to pause its work if requested by the Director of Public Prosecutions where a concern exists that the matter being discussed at the commission might interfere with any aspect of an ongoing criminal prosecution against Mr. Kenneally. The DPP will be monitoring proceedings closely and has agreed to contact my Department should any difficulties arise. I acknowledge the importance of this debate and we are somewhat constricted with the time. I will pause my comments and offer further information to the House regarding detailed arrangements for the commission of investigation following statements from other Members.

We believe it appropriate that there should be a commission of investigation into the matters outlined in the terms of reference laid before the House. Since I became justice spokesperson for Fianna Fáil over two years ago, many groups have come to ask for the support of Fianna Fáil in seeking commissions of investigations or tribunals of inquiry. It is difficult at times but in most instances I have said it is inappropriate to have a commission of investigation or tribunal of inquiry. Sometimes they would not be of benefit or there would be no practicality to the proposal put before me. However, last year I had the opportunity along with my leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, to meet a group of victims of Bill Kenneally. They were accompanied by a very well-intentioned and informed adviser. I listened to what they had to say and read about the matters they outlined. I considered what they said was in the public interest and about having matters investigated. Along with Deputy Martin and the rest of my party, we came to the conclusion that this is one of the issues that would merit a commission of investigation. After the meeting that Deputy Martin and I had with the victims of Mr. Kenneally, I wrote to the Minister's predecessor and the Taoiseach to suggest that there should be a commission of investigation into this matter. I commend the Minister on his agreeing to put the motion before the House. I am conscious that there are pending criminal charges against Mr. Kenneally. It is also important to note, however, that the function of this commission of investigation will be very different from the function of the criminal process. The major allegation made by the men who are victims of Bill Kenneally is that authorities did not respond appropriately to numerous warnings made to them about the abuse being committed by Mr. Kenneally. That is not a matter that will be determined or resolved in a criminal trial, and the criminal trial process will only determine the guilt or innocence of Mr. Kenneally in respect of numerous offences. It is for that reason it is very appropriate that we should have an inquisitorial process running parallel to a criminal trial process. In this case they are not incompatible. I say to the victims of Mr. Kenneally that a commission of investigation is sometimes a crude vehicle. All it can do is establish facts, make recommendations and highlight deficiencies in the past. I have great confidence in retired judge Mr. Barry Hickson that he will do that. I commend the Minister on his choice and I hope this is a successful and prompt commission of investigation. 
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	331	I make it absolutely and emphatically clear that I and my party have fully supported requests by the victims of Bill Kenneally for an independent inquiry and I fully support this motion before the Dáil. I thank the Minister for bringing it to the House. What the victims have gone through is absolutely horrific. I welcome those of them who are in the Gallery this evening. It is totally and utterly unacceptable that the victims were exposed for so long to such appalling emotional, sexual and physical abuse. The bravery and courage of the victims in waiving their anonymity and their perseverance in striving for justice, fairness and truth cannot be underestimated. The toll it has taken on these men, on their parents, families, wives and partners and children is incomprehensible. As a mother, I cannot even imagine the effect of the absolute horror these men endured. The time has now come for answers. The fact that Bill Kenneally was allowed to abuse children for such a protracted period is an indictment on the State and answers are needed as to how this was allowed to happen. Who knew what and when? The draft terms of reference will investigate all aspects of the case with reference to the Garda, the South Eastern Health Board, Basketball Ireland, clergy and public figures. This is absolutely needed and full transparency and co-operation is essential. These men want to move on with their lives; they want and deserve answers. These men need closure and I hope this commission of inquiry will bring that about. These men have waited far too long.

I know there was some discussion on how it would interact with the process in the courts but it is right and proper that this proceeds. The real credit lies with the victims who have campaigned for the establishment of this commission of investigation. I acknowledge those who are present, including Mr. Colin Power and Mr. Barry Murphy. Mr. Jason Clancy first made the complaint and there was also Mr. Kevin Keating, among others. I and others have met these men and I hope we have been of some assistance.The greatest credit lies with them because it is clearly very difficult to come forward and tell the story of the depravity of the actions of Mr. Kenneally and the failures relating to them. As the Minister outlined, we are obviously somewhat constrained in what we can say. However, what we can say is that it is a fact that Bill Kenneally is convicted of sexual assaults. We can say that serious questions arise for a number of organisations in the context of their failures. The terms of reference refer to An Garda Síochána, the South-Eastern Health Board, Basketball Ireland, the Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore and unnamed political figures. This was allowed to continue for far too long. It is an indictment on the State that so many people were failed over such a protracted period. In the Upper House, Senator Diarmuid Wilson quoted Mr. Justice George Birmingham, who said that in his experience he was not aware of a case involving such a number of victims, where the abuse was so severe, coupled with the breach of trust, the use of alcohol, the payment of money and the use of photos as a form of coercion. The abuse involved was absolutely horrific - the courts have addressed this and will continue, I hope, to address this - and it was accompanied by deep-seated failures on the part of numerous voluntary organisations and agencies of the State. That is, in and of itself, an appalling act. I hope the commission will address it. I wish Judge Barry Hickson well. I hope this process will allow truth and accountability to result. I thank the Minister for bringing forward the motion but the greatest credit is due to those who campaigned for this day. I hope they are pleased and welcome it. I hope that it will result in the justice and truth they so desire.

Like previous speakers, I welcome Mr. Power and Mr. Murphy, who are in the Gallery. I commend the people who have supported all these victims in recent years in their quest for justice and truth. It is important for us to note that there are dozens of victims who have not come forward. They also deserve our support at this time. Unfortunately, the acts of depravity mentioned earlier, and of which we are aware, were perpetrated against so many young men in Waterford city and its environs. It is a scandal that needs to be properly investigated. We have criminal trials. In this case, we had a criminal trial in which Mr. Kenneally was found guilty of very serious abuse and sexual assault. The central allegation made by some of the victims that needs to be explored and interrogated by the commission is that State agencies did not properly investigate the claims made. It is alleged that they did not properly investigate or do their job in respect of allegations made. That is serious and it raises questions about An Garda Síochána, the Catholic Church, the old South-Eastern Health Board, public figures, Basketball Ireland and, potentially, other organisations as well. I have no wish to say any more than that because no one wants to prejudice any future criminal proceedings that may arise. However, I am keen to ensure that all those victims get full support, get the truth and that any organisation found wanting by not supporting the victims or failing in its duties should be examined by the commission. It should examine these matters without fear or favour. I commend the Minister on establishing the commission of investigation. He will have the support of my party in ensuring this process is fair and that the victims get the support they need.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	334	I wish to begin by thanking the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, for bringing this motion before the House. I call on the Minister to thank his immediate predecessor, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, who agreed to do this. As others have said, there are numerous demands for particular forms of inquiry, including commissions of inquiry and tribunals. It is difficult to say "No" but I believe the compelling case made by the victims in this case had to be responded to. I attended the meeting in November 2016. I asked the then Tánaiste to meet the victims and hear what they had to say. I spoke to the Tánaiste's advisor immediately afterwards. She said it was the most emotionally draining meeting she had ever attended. As Deputies can imagine, officials from the Department of Justice and Equality hear many emotionally draining stories. The bravery and persistence of the victims of Bill Kenneally need to be recognised in this House. It takes a great deal for a person to continue to keep telling his hurtful and painful story. When we meet the victims together, it is like they have gone through something that is unique and that forms a bond between them. They are seekers of the truth and they want to know how was allowed to happen. I have read about and debated many of the cases of sexual assault and abuse involving various institutions in recent years. However, I can honestly say that the details of the abuse perpetrated – I am referring to the convictions achieved and not any allegations made – by Bill Kenneally were among the most shocking and abominable that I have had recounted to me. What is of concern to the victims now - the reason they have clamoured so earnestly, persistently and strongly for this particular inquiry - is the degree of licence that was afforded to their abuser. That is what enabled him to continue abusing children over a protracted period. Who else was involved? Who else knew? What cries for help were recorded and then ignored or not acted upon? These matters are rightfully now before Judge Barry Hickson. It is a milestone to have reached this point. We have shone light into many dark crevices of Irish life over the past two decades. This investigation will be most worthwhile because it will explore why this was allowed to happen and why, on the face of it, many cries of help were not responded to and many opportunities to reach out to either the health authorities, the police and so on were missed. We need to know why and how that happened and how so many victims were brutalised in this awful way. Extraordinary work was done by all the victims but I wish to mention Jason Clancy in particular for providing such an important grounding document. It was most helpful in the beginning. It set out the case so well and set out the matters that needed to be looked at in such compelling form. It has brought us to today. I am delighted that we can now embark upon this process. I know this has not been an easy process to navigate and investigate in parallel with criminal proceedings and investigations. I commend the Minister on his persistence. It could have been an easier option to simply say that we can do nothing until all these matters are fully investigated - and that could take years. As we know, witnesses are no longer available. Some have died in the intervening period between the first meeting with the former Tánaiste and today. That is why it is important to get going on this important work. I thank the Minister for his personal commitment to achieving it.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	335	I welcome the motion to establish a commission of investigation into the handling of complaints against the convicted Waterford child sex abuser Bill Kenneally. Most important, I wish to commend the courageous individual men who stood up and pushed for an inquiry from the beginning. That was after having been denied justice initially when they revealed Bill Kenneally's crimes to trusting adults at the time but were ignored. These heroes have forced the Government to commit to uncovering yet another dark truth from Ireland's shady past. I hope this process leads to the State acknowledging those who were responsible for the silence and cover-up which enabled these atrocious crimes to be carried out on young boys over a period spanning 30 years. I am also happy that Jason Clancy, Colin Power, Barry Murphy, Kevin Keating, Paul Walsh and Gerry Mullane, the men who stood up for justice for all victims of Bill Kenneally, have welcomed the terms of reference announced by the Minister. I am delighted they had a direct input into the process of setting out the terms of reference and made some necessary amendments which I understand were accepted by the Government. This establishes a necessary template for how victims of abuse can have direct involvement in their pursuit of justice. I am also glad that the commission is empowered to investigate information indicating that gardaí were informed of the allegations against Mr. Kenneally either before or after the specific years as contained in the terms of reference. Nobody should be immune from justice.  The terms of reference are also wide-ranging, leaving no stone unturned. They include An Garda Síochána, the South Eastern Health Board, Basketball Ireland, the Waterford Catholic diocese and unnamed political figures. While the allegations made by the abuse survivors were primarily against the gardaí, the commission will have powers to investigate acts or omissions of the other organisations if it was shown gardaí passed information to them regarding any offences allegedly committed by Kenneally.  As we undertake another commission of inquiry, we need to ask ourselves why Ireland has had such a blighted history, particularly when it comes to the well-being of children. The answer is aptly reflected in the following quote: "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power to corrupt absolutely”. These were words used by a 19th century historian to describe the overwhelming power of the church and its close relationship to the State at that time. Now, almost 200 years later, it still adequately identifies that element in Irish history which uniquely enabled abuse to be carried out on such a grand scale and for so long.  Systemic abuse does not happen in isolation. It requires the secrecy of a larger group of people, mainly those who have the power and networks available to them to maintain that secrecy. Thereby the criminal act continues to be carried out. The fact that Kenneally was allowed to abuse children for such a protracted period is an indictment on the State and its cosy relationship with key organisations in the past. This put children and vulnerable people in danger while entire populations were marginalised by the culture of silence and fear.  It takes a larger system of support for a man like this to do what he did. It will take an entire country to account for that and change this for the future. Taking into consideration all the inquiries into clerical child abuse, for example, a remarkable feature has been the low conviction rate of alleged perpetrators in the courts. In September 2015, the National Board for Safeguarding Children, the Catholic Church watchdog in Ireland, published a report into 325 allegations made against 141 members of six religious congregations. The report found that only eight led to convictions.  Irish men and women who were sexually abused in schools when they were children are still fighting for redress, despite the European Court of Human Rights finding the State liable for abuse suffered by Cork woman Louise O'Keeffe in 2014. This is unacceptable and indicates Ireland’s inability to come to terms with its past or accept the level of responsibility needed to ensure all victims have access to justice and to ensure that these horrific acts are never carried out again under the nose of the State.  However, a report published only this month by HIQA confirms those days are not entirely over. Shortcomings in Tusla were uncovered in an investigation by the authority revealing children in danger of sexual abuse are being left at risk by serious weaknesses in social services. How can we still be at a stage in our history where children are put at risk by the State? As we enter the realm of more than a dozen commissions of investigations and inquiries, I hope that this one will not be unnecessarily delayed and that it will remain a transparent process for all victims of abuse involved. I hope the process will also offer some reflection on the part of the State in how it can best protect children now and into the future.

For the victims of Bill Kenneally, this traumatic saga has been dragging on for almost three decades. I thank the Minister for being so forthright since he came to office and for establishing this inquiry. I note his comments cautioning Members against saying anything that might interfere with the pursuit of justice for the victims, and I respect that.  The victims’ search for justice and accountability is not yet complete. It is an absolute disgrace that when power is challenged in this State, events seem to move at a tortuously slow pace. This is something that we have seen in many areas. Every institution in this State seems utterly incapable of responding with speed and compassion to instances of horrendous human rights violations. It is often those institutions charged with the care of the most vulnerable that are slowest to respond. I hope this commission will efficiently move us toward a place where all relevant facts are made known.  I wish Judge Barry Hickson well. The investigation will be harrowing given the scale of the abuse under review. Mr. Kenneally was convicted in 2016 on ten sample counts of abuse of young boys during the 1980s and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. A further 99 criminal charges have been brought against him respect of two other complainants. The terms of reference for this commission were a matter of some concern for the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecution who feared how it might impact future or ongoing legal proceedings. I have no desire to say or do anything that might jeopardise those cases. My only interest here is to say to the victims of Bill Kenneally that I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group will stand with them and do all we can to ensure that justice is victorious.  Child abuse is one of the most horrific crimes. To betray children’s trust in such a brutalising manner ought to incur the severest of penalties, both for the perpetrator and those guilty of shielding him, if that is what happened. To seek to prioritise the protection of reputations, either of individuals or institutions, ahead of protecting children is an abomination and a disgrace and it is to be utterly condemned regardless of when and where it occurs.

I agree with Deputy Howlin who adverted to our being here in this House once again debating another element of our dark history, having failed to properly respond to child sexual abuse. It has been prevalent throughout society down the decades but has been kept secret and hidden through fear, inactivity and the abuse of power. The commission will look at what the gardaí knew, when they knew it, what they did and whom they told. If necessary, the commission will investigate the responses or actions of a number of identified bodies and persons that have been mentioned. I am struck by Deputy Cullinane's comments when he spoke of people coming forward now. He mentioned numbers of others who may come forward. I welcome this but it is not the purpose of the commission to investigate the substance of any allegations or complaints. They should be made to An Garda Síochána in the first instance. Anyone who has any information or who wishes to make a complaint which has not been made should do so to An Garda Síochána and not to the commission. My view, and it has been shared by Deputy O'Callaghan and others, is that it is necessary to establish a commission to investigate and report on the matters of public concern, as set out in the statement of reasons. The commission will be located in accommodation sourced by the Office of Public Works, namely Tom Johnson House in Beggars Bush, Dublin 4. This is where persons will be invited to appear and give evidence before the sole member. A process is under way to identify suitable counsel and legal staff to assist the work of the sole member in the administration of the commission. Based on experience gained from previous commissions of investigation, its cost is estimated to be between €1.3 million and €1.5 million.This figure is sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I know that Judge Hickson, those appointed to the commission and my own officials will monitor the budgets closely to ensure that any costs incurred are reasonable and appropriate in all circumstances.  Again I pay tribute to the brave men who, in late 2016, came to the then Tánaiste with their harrowing stories. These men had suffered for almost 30 years but bravely chose to break their silence. They now want the truth about whether action could and should have been taken earlier. It is my sincere hope that the commission can get to the truth of all the issues raised by the victims, which are reflected in the terms of reference before us. It would not be right, or indeed fair, to the organisations or persons who will be subject to the commission's inquiries to prejudge any matter that may come before the sole member, however it is fundamentally important that these allegations of inaction, secrecy and collusion are properly investigated and that, if they are found to be true, those involved are fully exposed. There can be no more hiding of such insidious crimes in our country. I hope the work of the commission and the improvements which I am committed to implementing in respect of the rights of victims in sexual abuse cases can act as a beacon to those living in fear and to those afraid to speak out against their abusers, whether that abuser is a family member, a family friend or a complete stranger. To all of those persons I say that we are here to listen and to assist and help.  The Cabinet has approved and noted the documents before the House today. I ask that Members respect the opinions of the survivors of abuse committed by Bill Kenneally. They have approved these terms of reference as the most expedient and transparent way of getting to the truth of what was known and by whom about the offending, offensive and unacceptable behaviour of Mr. Bill Kenneally in the mid to late 1980s. In conclusion, I ask the House to approve the order to establish the commission of investigation. I thank Members for their support.

She is at a family event. Her child is graduating from school. I would like to say a few words on the Bill on her behalf. Overall I welcome the Bill and commend the work done on it by the Minister and her Department, as well as by Deputies, Senators, the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs. It was a long process and it is good to finally see it near completion. I particularly commend the staff in the Minister’s Department, who were very helpful in organising briefings for Deputy Mitchell, in answering questions and in discussing amendments that Opposition Members brought forward. As we have said before, this is only an initial step in bringing about genuinely affordable childcare for those who need it. Over the next few years, we will need to see a number of things happen. Subsidies and capitation grants must increase to bring down the overall cost of childcare. There is a crisis in staffing when it comes to the early years sector and we need to see action in that regard because if we do not, we risk losing an awful lot of highly skilled educators. They are people who have a real grá for working with children and we need to ensure they see a future for themselves in that area of work here in Ireland. I assure the Minister that any progressive initiatives she takes to address the issue of low pay in the sector will have the full support of Sinn Féin. We also need to see more being done to bring childminders into the scheme and to encourage them to register with Tusla. We need to work with them to ensure that childminders do not feel left behind in this process. Overall I commend the work done in this area and the Minister herself. There is a lot more to be done and I hope this will remain a key issue for the Government over the coming years. I trust the Minister will keep this House updated and informed on the scheme's progress.

I congratulate her and her officials because they have done a stellar job in bringing forward this legislation. To quote from the Minister's own speech on this legislation, it will replace "all existing targeted child care subvention schemes with a single, streamlined scheme that will provide the framework for increasing public investment in child care over the years ahead". Now that the legislation is done and dusted and on a statutory footing, we look forward to marking the Minister, in the most respectful way. We hope that the Minister will be able to deliver further within her Department with regard to bringing resources to this sector at a time when we are being told that greater funding is available in the Exchequer pot. We hope that the Minister will be able to fight her battle internally with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to do even more good work in this space. I congratulate the Minister.

It is a very historic Bill for all sorts of reasons. I am particularly grateful for the engagement of the Deputies present and that of the colleagues they are representing and for their enthusiasm and co-operation. Both Houses have approached this important legislation in that way. The amendments brought forward and made both in the Dáil and in the Seanad have undoubtedly strengthened the Bill. I also thank the officials in my own Department - and I am delighted to hear everyone else doing so as well - and the Office of the Attorney General for a lot of substantive work on this Bill. As I have stated before, affordable, quality childcare can generate many vital and long-lasting benefits for children, women, families, the economy and for society at large. In order to ensure access to quality childcare we have to make childcare more affordable. The Bill provides the legal basis for doing just that.In establishing the affordable childcare scheme, the Bill will create a platform that embodies the principle of progressive universalism, with both universal and targeted elements and with strong governance, a focus on quality and the ability to flex and expand to allow more children and families to benefit from greater State investment - public investment - in childcare in the years ahead. In short, it is essential for my pledge to transform our childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the best. We cannot make that step change without the Bill. The affordable childcare scheme is only the beginning of the journey. From this very robust starting point, we will seek to grow and develop our funding model for early years care and education. We have identified some of the ways in which we are considering doing that in the early years strategy to tackle disadvantage, to recognise that high-quality services are dependent on a valued workforce whose working conditions support retention and, through all of this, to invest in the future of our children and families. This is a great day for early years provision in Ireland. The Bill represents a milestone on the journey towards the childcare system we want to see. As I already indicated, it will be complemented by and coupled with the publishing of the early years strategy, which refers to many of the initiatives that the Deputies in their concluding remarks have said are outstanding. We now have a legislative basis for a system which ensures that all families have access to high-quality preschool and school-age childcare, a system that will work with families to give children a great start in life, and a system in which all families who need childcare can afford it. I commend the Bill to the House.

It has been badly needed for a long time. It has been very slow to reach its present stage. We want to make sure it is enacted and brought into force as quickly as possible. I proposed an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that the legislation had to be in force within 12 months, at a maximum. Many of my colleagues on the committee felt this period was too long. Some wanted a period of three months while others wanted six months. As a result, I decided to recast the amendment to provide that the legislation would come into force within six months. I note that the Minister, in responding to my amendment on Committee Stage, said it was impossible to include what I proposed because we could not rule out the constitutional process that includes the President, the Council of State and the referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court. In other words, the Minister was saying there is always a possibility that the Bill may be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution and that this might defeat the timescale. I point out to her, however, that under Article 26.2.1° of the Constitution, it is provided that the President must make a decision on referral to the Supreme Court within seven days of receipt of the Bill, and then the Supreme Court has a limited time within which to make a decision, that being not more than 60 days. I do not believe that is an impediment to accepting the amendment I propose.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	348	I support this amendment. It is important. Deputy O'Dea is correct that this legislation has been a long time coming. It has to be said that without Sinn Féin and the Bill introduced by Deputy David Cullinane in 2016, dealing with if-and-when and zero-hour contracts, there would not now be a focus on getting this legislation across the line. The Bill introduced by Deputy David Cullinane passed through Committee Stage. There were full hearings and cross-party support on numerous amendments that were made. Some of those were reflected in some of the amendments Sinn Féin submitted on Committee Stage of this Bill. It is imperative that this legislation be strengthened. It is critical that there be no delays in implementing it when it is passed. Some concerns have been expressed by organisations such as IBEC with a view to trying to force our hand in terms of rowing back on some of the amendments agreed on Committee Stage. I refer to the bands adopted on foot of amendments Sinn Féin put forward and which were supported by others. Six months is time enough - too long, really. I would love to see this legislation enacted straight away or certainly within six months of its passing. Sinn Féin will certainly be supporting this amendment.

Dunnes Stores workers went on strike in 2015 looking for the Secure Hours - Better Future charter. This included the look-back and the banded hours. It is important that this legislation go through as quickly as possible. I saw the letter IBEC sent expressing its concerns and the implications of proposed banded-hours legislation. This legislation is putting it up to employers to deliver for workers. It would actually give security to workers in the retail sector, including Dunnes Stores workers, and the capacity to increase their hours over time. I support this amendment because it is important that the period be no longer than six months.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	350	This is a very reasonable amendment. The period started off being 12 months. I recall Deputy Brady proposed three months on Committee Stage. I referred to a period of six months at the time. This legislation has been a long time in gestation. We all know how critical it is to get it on the Statute Book in order to end exploitative practices that have occurred and that continue in various strands of employment across the State. I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward. I have no doubt that her bona fides are very strong. All of these amendments strengthen the legislation so it will have a more significant impact and consequences for workers. Six months is a reasonable period for the enactment of the legislation. It allows bedding-in time and it allows people to get used to it. Employers will no doubt have to adjust and get used to various issues that will be addressed in this legislation. That is important. I recall the Minister referring to the constitutional constraint or the circumscribing of the legislation, perhaps by negativing the constitutional imperatives that exist. The President signs the legislation and if somebody finds it is not to his liking, he can take a case to the High Court to test its constitutionality. If one does not agree with some of the sentiments or objectives of the legislation, one is free to challenge it in other ways, provided one has plenty of wealth or resources. One can challenge somebody who is trying to seek to enforce or rely on the objectives in the legislation. I would not be as worried about that as the Minister, although she did indicate it is a concern. She also indicated that she would, on Report Stage, see how this would work.I would be surprised if the Minister was not in a position to accept this amendment in order to ensure that, before we leave for the summer, this legislation will be on the Statute Book.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	351	It is good to be still able to surprise a gentleman. This amendment is designed to ensure the Act is commenced within six months. While I share the Deputies’ concern that the legislation has to be commenced as soon as is possible, it must also be understood that I cannot interfere with the functions of the President, who has to sign a Bill into law, or the Supreme Court. The President may, after consulting with the Council of State, refer a Bill to the Supreme Court. It would be unconstitutional if this Bill excluded the role of the President or the Supreme Court from the legislative process. For that reason alone, we are going to reject the amendment. I appreciate that is not Deputy O’Dea’s aim, however. When he submitted a similar amendment on Committee Stage, I pointed out that section 1(2) contains the standard provision dealing with commencement which is normally used in all legislation passed by the Oireachtas. I also indicated that the amendment proposed by the Deputy does not appear to exist in any other single Bill, including all of the Private Members’ Bills sponsored by the Deputy's party. On the contrary, I found several examples of where Fianna Fáil Private Members’ Bills used the standard commencement provision which we are using in section 1(2). I genuinely see no good reason to move away from this well-established approach. I indicated on Committee Stage that my priority with this Bill is to work with all sides of the House to deliver legislation which is fair, balanced and works in practice. I assure the Deputy that remains my position. I want to see the legislation enacted at the earliest opportunity. However, for the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the amendment.

The simple reason is that the amendment does not in any way interfere with the Constitution. Article 26.2.1° is quite clear. When legislation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, there is a short interim period during which the Bill is handed to the President for signature. The Constitution provides that if the President decides to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court, he or she must do so within seven days. The article further provides that when it goes to the Supreme Court, the court must make a decision on that matter within 60 days. Accordingly, we are well within the six months. I believe it is not unreasonable to look for this legislation to be commenced within six months, particularly in view of the length of time we have been waiting for it.

While I appreciate what the Deputy said, there is a long-established practice in the House that we commence legislation in a way that is cognisant of the other institutions which have a role to play. I see no reason to change that.

However, this will be an unintended consequence if the provision remains in the Bill. I hope all that Deputies can see the difficulties created and that we might have a bit of common sense. The Opposition amendment carried on Committee Stage inserts a different standard of proof from that in section 7(2)(a) of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994. The latter is one of the Acts this Bill amends. This will cause confusion for the parties in making their cases and in particular for the adjudication officer in deciding whether an employer has been penalised. It would also present a difficulty to the Labour Court on appeal. That is its opinion and not mine. It would also leave the WRC or the Labour Court open to judicial review as to which section the adjudication officer relies on in deciding a complaint. Would it be section 6C(6) or 7(2)(a)? Whichever section an adjudication officer relied on, the decision would be open to be challenged on the basis that he or she did not rely on the other section regardless of the substance of the decision or the complaint. Employers intent on circumventing the penalisation provision could challenge any decision of an adjudication officer or the Labour Court on this basis, thus rendering a strong employee protection provision practically ineffective. The Opposition amendment agreed to by the select committee was also probably not needed. The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as initiated introduced a penalisation provision to the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994. The penalisation provision mirrored the one in the Protection of Employment (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012. There is also a strong protection against penalisation. It is tried and tested and there is no evidence that the relevant provisions are lacking in any respect.

The Minister says that strictly speaking there is no need for it because the presumption is there already. I am not absolutely clear about that. I think this really ties it in. The Minister referred to judicial review, the WRC, etc. We did not get that elaborate explanation on Committee Stage. This is something new which we are talking about for the first time. I would like the Minister to elaborate on it before we make a decision.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	362	We are fine with amendment No. 3, which deals with the drafting error. However, we are not fine with the deletion called for in amendment No. 4. This is an interesting proposal to delete an amendment tabled by the Minister. The amendment proposes to delete the burden of proof on an employer that a worker's complaint is not justified. Where would it place that burden of proof? In reality it would be on the shoulders of the worker in question. It is implicit that complaints of a broadly spurious character would be made. Every Deputy knows of a pretty big lobbying campaign by employer organisations on aspects of the Bill. We all received correspondence this day last week from IBEC asking for changes in the Bill, watering it down and placing less responsibility on employers. The Minister indicated in the House recently that she met IBEC representatives to discuss their concerns. Did her proposal to delete or amend her own proposal come before or after the discussion with the IBEC representatives? Is this an indication of successful lobbying by IBEC? Is it an example of Fine Gael bending the knee to IBEC? Is it an example of the Minister giving to IBEC that which IBEC seeks? Certainly the Minister's proposal to delete would not find approval among Dunnes Stores workers, other retail workers or other workers faced with this type of employment, who, I can assure the Minister, are not prone to making spurious complaints and will not welcome that the employer is somewhat out the gap if the Minister's amendment is passed. I would like to know more about the process that led up to the Minister's decision to amend the Bill and to delete her own section of the Bill, an amendment which is not good news for workers and which will please the employers and their representative organisations.

She is very late in bringing her explanation to the Chamber. It would have been good if we could have seen why it is being changed even a couple of days ago. That, at least, would have provided an opportunity to check with the WRC and the Labour Court that it is duplication or negates another part of the other Bill. Is that what the Minister is saying? I cannot say hand on heart that she is wrong or that they are wrong because I have not had a chance to check it out. Certainly Deputy O'Dea should have been informed of it because he tabled the amendment to the Bill at the time. It is very frustrating to get that information now when we felt we were making the provisions of the Bill more robust on Committee Stage. I am not sure about my thinking on it. I ask the Minister to come back and elaborate. I am not happy. The unions raised the matter with us and they wanted to keep these provisions in the Bill to make it as robust as possible for their members.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	364	I wish to add to the points already made. It is strange to do as proposed here and put the onus back on the complainant rather than on the respondent. If the Minister is saying "No", perhaps she could come back and explain that. Under the Unfair Dismissals Act, an employer has to prove that he fairly dismissed a worker who took a complaint against him. Removing this amendment, which the Minister put in, actually puts the reverse into law. I think it should be allowed and we will oppose its removal.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	365	I understand that the thrust of the amendment, if accepted, would appear to undermine in some way the protection of employees from penalisation as it would remove the requirement on the employer to prove that they did not penalise or threaten an employee against their assertion or the reliance upon the rights that are being outlined in the Bill. Deputy Bríd Smith is correct about the presumption in the Unfair Dismissals Act which deals with this because a presumption is something that is rebuttable. Having a presumption means that the other side can actually come in with facts to rebut it at a tribunal. That might be a way of trying to deal with it. I have to listen to what the Minister said. If the Labour Court and the WRC are saying that it is not workable or that there is a lacuna and they do not know what particular section can be relied upon, it creates a difficulty. We already have legislation going through the House that was described as a dog's dinner. Somebody said it is an insult to the dogs to even talk about giving them a dinner like that.

A more detailed explanation for why those particular adjudicative bodies, which are central to the industrial relations machinery of the State, are concerned might help to allay our fears. My colleague is right that there obviously has been significant agitation by IBEC on behalf of employers. I see nothing wrong with that - it is the cut and thrust of participative legislation - as long as it admits what it is doing. It has to do that now. Workers' representatives have been in contact with us and they are very keen about this. This element of the legislation is critical in their view. We have a Hobson's choice here. The Minister and an arm of the industrial relations machinery of the State are saying one thing and workers' representatives, who are at the coalface, are saying it is absolutely critical. When will we get to the final point? That is the critical thing. We are at the last staging post now in terms of legislative intervention. I hope this can be clarified. The debate may well have to be adjourned until tomorrow so we can get further clarification so we know exactly what the import of the deletion would be. It is something that is causing us concern.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	368	It is really unhelpful for the Minister to throw this on the table at this point. Committee Stage is when legislation is supposed to be teased out and any potential pitfalls or issues of concern debated and amended. For this to come before the house at, essentially, the 12th hour is really unhelpful. My party is here to strengthen this legislation because workers right across the State are screaming out for this and have been for many years. That is where Sinn Féin is coming from. We have listened to the trade unions representing those workers and they are concerned by the Government's amendment seeking to remove this from the legislation. They indicate that it is critical because it is there to strengthen workers' rights in terms of the burden of proof. The amendment would delete the lines on page 10 of the Bill which state, "Where in any proceedings facts are established by or on behalf of a complainant from which it may be presumed that this section has been contravened the onus shall be on the respondent to prove the contrary." That is what the Minister wants to remove. My party and I oppose its removal. The Minister has stated that she is removing it because the WRC said it causes it serious concern and that it has serious questions around it. All legislation is open to legal challenge. That is always the case. It is concerning that the Minister has come in and said that. Mandate has said the complete opposite. It is saying it is imperative it remains. I am not sure. I think the Minister needs to elaborate on the points she has made. It is a matter of concern that this has appeared at, as already stated, the 12th hour.

Where a provision has been agreed on Committee Stage - when one would expect the Minister to be in possession of all of the facts, details and advice - it is extremely unsatisfactory that there be a proposal to change it a few weeks later on Report Stage. One cannot help but think that there is a connection between this and other deletions the Minister is proposing and the strong lobbying by IBEC and others on the proposal to strengthen workers' rights. It seems to be a bit of a coincidence that this is happening. One can understand why people are sceptical about what is being said. It would certainly seem that on the surface the Minister is seeking to weaken the provisions of the Bill by proposing this amendment. In a situation where it is presumed that the section in question has been contravened, surely the burden of proof should be on the employer. The Minister is seeking to remove this, which, by anyone's standards, seems to indicate that she is weakening the protection she had earlier proposed. We are sceptical about what the Minister is saying but we have to take it on face value. It would be worthwhile if we just held off on voting on the amendment. We are nearly out of time in any event. Will the Minister commit to circulating the representations she has received from the WRC and the Labour Court straight after this debate? It is important that we hear what they are saying about it and the points they make about the legislation because we are open to considering it if they have made a strong case. I ask the Minister to circulate the representations she has received from the industrial relations machinery immediately after this debate.

I will undertake to do exactly what the Deputy suggested. I will correct a number of inaccuracies from the past couple of minutes. I am not trying to change anything that I put into the Bill. When the penalisation provisions were attempted to be amended on Committee Stage, the Government voted against the proposal. I articulated for all of the Members who were present for the Committee Stage debate the reasons the Government was voting against it. It is no different from what I described just moments ago, with the exception that I have had the time and space to go to the WRC and the Labour Court and ask them their opinions on the Committee Stage amendment. That is what I read out a few moments ago. I am not sure at what other point I could have given the House that information other than on Report Stage. The only reason I am trying to amend the Bill by making both of the deletions in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 is to strengthen it and bring it back to where it was. Effectively, what the Labour Court and WRC are telling us is that because we have inserted two standards, nobody has to meet either because if an employee made a complaint on one standard there is the option for an employer to appeal or initiate a judicial review because the employee did not make the case on the basis of the other standard. The likelihood is that one or other of the provisions will be rendered useless. What we all wanted through Second Stage and Committee Stage was to have a penalisation provision and protection for employees to make sure if they took a case to the WRC the burden of proof was equal and that it was the WRC, as is its right in statute, that would adjudicate on the merits of the complaint. We absolutely acknowledge there are no such things as frivolous complaints being made. When employees take cases to the WRC or the Labour Court, they have substantive reasons for doing so. As I have run out of time and given that my word is not good enough, I will commit to furnishing to the members of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, between now and tomorrow evening, the representations and responses I received from the WRC and the Labour Court.

I am happy to introduce this motion on the role and the place of special needs assistants, SNAs, particularly in our primary schools but also in our post-primary schools. At present, there is massive frustration on the part of principals, boards of management, parents' councils, parents, families of children with special needs and, most important, SNAs themselves. They do excellent work and are very enthusiastic about their job. They love being assistants to children with special needs and they have a flair for it. It is a vocation for them and they should be allowed to continue with some certainty. The uncertainty affecting the SNA system at the moment is appalling. The Minister was in Tipperary recently and announced a whole raft of new SNAs but, on the same day, St. Mary's CBS in Irishtown in Clonmel was losing SNAs. Announcements are grand and they are dandy but we deal with practicalities, real situations in classrooms and schools. Parents are being left in confusion for prolonged periods when they attempt to get a definite answer as to whether their child will receive the vital assistance of an SNA for the forthcoming academic year. It is very trying and worrying. There is a view, promoted by the Minister, that an SNA is some sort of luxury item for a school rather than a valued, core member of staff. In my constituency families and schools contact me every week, 12 months of the year, to try to get their concerns addressed. SNAs such as Anne Lohan, Sharon Hewitt, Roisin McGrath and many others in Clonmel are experiencing enormous pressure but all they want to do is give care to the child to whom they are assigned. The children need them and the SNAs need to be able to get their hours without struggling. I spoke to Noelette and Tom Broughan who outlined events leading to their local school having to deny access to their autistic son, Bobby, who is due to attend in September 2018. Having an autistic child is difficult enough without creating all these uncertainties throughout the summer months. Bobby's enrolment was accepted in April 2018 but today they received a call from the principal revoking the enrolment because SNA hours had been significantly reduced on Friday, 8 June, at a similar time to when the Minister was making his announcements of all the new places. This is the real impact on the ground. As a direct consequence, young Bobby is not enrolled to attend school in his local community, which his parents rightly feel is discriminatory. The decision could be reversed if extra SNA hours were granted but the process to do so is arduous. This morning I was talking to an SNA who has years of experience in local schools but cannot get onto the supplementary amalgamation panel. That is another area that is causing confusion, distress and trauma. We have an absurd situation in which an SNA is required to have a minimum of one year's service but a year in a substitute capacity, that is, covering for maternity leave, sick leave, carer's breaks or job sharing, does not count. That is silly. What kind of a backwards way is this to approach the retention of valued SNA staff? This person told me that, this morning, she has become so frustrated with the difficulties she is having getting onto the assignment panel that she is thinking of changing career. What a loss when an experienced person like this woman is forced to change career. It is the children's loss too. We need to address the gross deficiencies in the system if we are serious about valuing SNAs. I ask the Minister to show some seriousness in his reply tonight. In October 2017, 8,000 SNAs who were members of the IMPACT trade union voted in favour of industrial action. Do we want a repeat of that scenario? That is where we are heading if the urgent changes we are calling for do not happen. It is in light of these difficulties that the motion by the Rural Independent Group also calls on the Government to provide some semblance of job security to SNAs by providing permanent contracts, and to aspire to assigning an SNA to every school on a full-time basis. I know the answer the Minister will give me to that but it is something we should aspire to. This will significantly reduce the time spent applying for SNAs every year and ensure that every child who needs SNA support receives it. Providing permanent contracts to SNAs will also provide some job security. These suggestions are not rocket science. They could be implemented without any major reviews. We call on the Minister to review the SNA supplementary assignment panel arrangements, and substitute works should be taken into consideration to enable all SNAs to gain entry onto the panel. I also call on the Minister to support and provide ongoing professional development options for SNAs to maximise responses to a child's professionally assessed disability or need. We want all teaching members of our schools to be as skilled as possible. This request, if accepted, will facilitate that. The Rural Independent Group also calls on the Minister and the Department to create a statutory forum in which the concerns and feedback of SNAs can be integrated into education policy development. It is not a big ask. If we are serious about listening to the concerns of SNAs, such a forum needs to be established.

My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group have called on the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to acknowledge a lack of job security for special needs assistants and to look at the obstacles preventing the full participation of special needs assistants in schools. We have to ask if our special needs assistants are being treated by the Department as optional extras, instead of being seen as vital members of the school teaching staff. We have heard many promises from the Government that it will increase the number of SNAs but where has it delivered in facilitating the special needs assistants as permanent members of staff in our schools? In a recent debate on schools, where there were up to 140 amendments to a Bill, we called for a vote, not in any way to indicate what way we were going to vote. A Deputy to my far right was playing with her Twitter account and wrote misleading comments about Deputies Mattie McGrath, Michael Healy-Rae and myself to the effect that we had called for a vote against special needs. It was absolutely shameful carry on.

It is a disgrace that any parent has to go through this stress to provide an adequate education for his or her child. We will not stand for it on this side. Others may, but we will not. I have had many school principals and boards of management approaching me to relay to me the amount of time they have to spend each year making applications for special needs assistants support for their schools. These school principals and boards of management are already under serious time pressures and this is only adding to the problem. The application process for special needs assistants needs to be reviewed urgently. It is a big obstacle preventing the full participation of special needs assistants in schools. The Rural Independent Group and I are calling on the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Government to provide job security to special needs assistants by providing permanent employment contracts. At the moment, if a special needs assistant is in a substitute capacity, that is, covering for maternity leave, sick leave, a career break, job sharing, etc., this does not count toward obtaining the requisite one year of service that allows a special needs assistant to become a member of the supplementary panel.  We call for a review of the special needs assistant supplementary assignment panel arrangements. Substitute work should be taken into consideration to enable all special needs assistants to gain entry to the panel. We also need to give certainty to parents. No parent should have to undergo the stress and worry around whether he or she will be assigned a special needs assistant for his or her child. We need change and I honestly hope that the Minister will seriously take on board our suggestions and will move to adopt policies to address the deficit we have identified in the SNA system. We will not be quietened or allow misleading comments about our contribution to this issue and other issues in respect of the same matter. I work on the board of management of a school and I work tirelessly to make sure we can address an issue like this going forward. I am delighted that we are bringing forward this motion tonight. 
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	410	This motion seeks to draw attention to a group of workers who have become a vital cog in our education system. As definitions of educational need evolve so too does the range of services that we need to provide a holistic approach to developing the child. I refer, especially, to developing and caring for children with disabilities or other special needs. This means other skills are needed to work in co-operation with the core activities of teaching. In the past, when we referred to the staff of a school, we generally meant teachers. This view is to ignore other workers who contribute to the essential smooth running of our modern school system and, of course, this includes special needs assistants. Special needs assistants are allocated to schools to work with children who have specific care needs. They provide non-teaching care support but, inevitably, this involves them in the teaching process as well. SNAs support pupils who have care needs resulting from a disability, an educational disability, a behavioural difficulty or significant medical need. This might include a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where the child's behaviour makes him or her a danger to themselves or other pupils. A pupil's need could range from needing an assistant for a few hours a week to needing a full-time care assistant.  SNAs may work with more than one child and in more than one school and they may work part time or full time. Most special needs assistants tend to be needed throughout the working day, which results in working non-stop from start to finish. This intensity of work needs to be recognised. This motion draws attention to what we might call a parallel universe that exists in many schools. Special needs assistants do not have the standards of employment enjoyed by their teacher colleagues and many of them have very poor terms and conditions of employment.  SNAs thus require security of tenure in their jobs and to have guaranteed work in one location or within a reasonable local area. They also need to be a given a service day, or days, to attend courses and to upskill their expertise in order to deliver to their maximum capacity. SNAs may need to have expertise in autism, dyslexia, spina bifida, scoliosis or a myriad of other conditions. Almost 35,000 students with additional care needs are supported by more than 14,000 special care need assistants in schools across the country each day. This motion - which focuses on SNAs - points out that they do not have job security. They can be let go at any time and the last SNA employed is usually the first to be let go. This is in spite of the extraordinary work they do in assisting with the care of pupils with disabilities in the educational context. I refer also to the role they play in supporting children who have additional care needs to attend school and participate fully in school life.  I welcome the announcement in May of the 1,000 extra special needs assistants being allocated to schools in the autumn to help meet the needs of vulnerable students. The Minister has said that this means that every child who needs SNA support will receive it. This is a laudable objective. It is equally important that SNAs are properly paid, have decent contracts and good conditions. If the Minister delivers on his commitment, 15,000 SNAs will be working in our schools by the end of this year, which is a 42% increase on 2011. That sounds impressive but in reality we are playing catch up following our austerity years.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has proposed broadening the role of SNAs, which is now limited to care needs. I understand it is proposed that SNAs assist with the delivery of speech and language and occupational therapy. This is to be welcomed. This means that the qualifications required to become an SNA must rise and existing staff would have to receive additional training. There is also a plan that SNAs be renamed special inclusion assistants to reflect their focus on developing students' independence. I also propose that an alternative would be school class inclusion assistants to give that educational component to it.  These proposals have to be generally welcomed. Change, however, needs to be implemented carefully and in consultation with other stakeholders. There are subtle differences between primary and secondary special needs assistants and these need to be recognised in their job descriptions and skill sets. In the past, the overlapping of the role of SNAs with areas teachers felt were within their remit gave rise to difficulties and these need to be sorted out. One of the proposals from the National Council for Special Education is to provide access to a greater range of supports and making expertise available in regional teams to support schools. I hope these teams are designed to include special needs assistants in addition to school management and teachers.  If we take a small rural school for example, it might have just one or two pupils requiring the services of a special needs assistant. It can happen that the special needs assistant might have no further work when that child leaves to go to secondary school or for many other reasons. On the other hand, if SNAs are part of the permanent local or regional team, then they can be allocated to schools according to need. It gives them security of tenure and it seems to be a sensible way to make the best use of resources. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has said that the Department of Education and Skills will begin to develop proposals to implement the recommendations of the comprehensive review of the special needs assistants scheme. He added, though, that it would take a number of years to implement and this proposed delay worries me. Why is it that any useful proposal has to take an eternity before it is implemented?I urge the Minister to proceed with that review as quickly as possible.  The current spending on special needs assistants, SNAs, is €525 million. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, estimates that the changes proposed would cost an additional €40 million per year. The proposed changes should be phased in over a period of time. Inevitably, improving the scheme will cost money, but it will be money well spent. Investment in special education saves us money in the long term. Research shows that early intervention with appropriate supports results in dramatically improved educational outcomes for children with special needs. 
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23844	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	411	It is hard to do justice to this debate in only ten minutes. I welcome the debate, and wish to indicate that I will not oppose either the Fianna Fáil amendment or the originating proposal. We have developed a very important service. Its aim has been to ensure that children with special educational needs fulfil their potential. We are now investing €1.8 billion in the support of children with special educational needs. The amount of investment has grown by 43% through the hard years since 2011. We have consistently expanded provision in this area, even through the most difficult times. This is not an optional extra in any sense, far from it. This is one area that has been exempted from cuts throughout successive Governments during the period of very real difficulty. Indeed, there has been an increase in support for children with special needs.  Compared with 2011, an additional 12,400 children now avail of the support of SNAs, an increase of 55%. The support those children receive is very important; it allows them to continue in education. I am in the Dáil long enough to remember a time when the Department of Education would fight court cases to deny children the benefits of an education of the sort we are now investing in so substantially. It represents a major improvement in our attitude and our values towards children with special needs.  It is important to remember that every child with a diagnosis and an identified need gets an SNA service. We are very conscious that there are long waiting lists for necessary services in many areas. Children are forced to wait and there is long duration between the identification of a need and being seen by a professional. That is not the case for SNAs. Furthermore, the decision to allocate an SNA to a child is decided upon by an independent body, the NCSE. There is also an independent appeals process, which has been underwritten by the Government. In my time as Minister for Education and Skills, we have delivered 1,000 additional SNAs each year to ensure we are meeting this growing need.  This year we have responded to one of the criticisms mentioned by Deputy Mattie McGrath, which was that there was an uncertainty as to whether SNAs would arrive at a school. The reason for that was that under the old procedure SNAs were not budgeted for in the Estimates. The NCSE would identify how many SNAs were required, but the Minister for Education had to go to the Minister for Finance and the Government to get a specific provision during the course of the year. For the first time ever, this has been built into the Estimates. Last year I made provision for 1,095 additional SNAs, and I was able to provide schools with individual allocations before the end of May. Applications are made in March, and the decisions are made and the schools informed in May. In addition, if during the course of the first term additional need is identified, we make an additional allocation in January.  We regard this as an extremely important area, but despite the substantial investment already made, we believe we can do better. That is the backdrop to the NCSE, at my request, carrying out an investigation into how this service can be improved. The recommendations made by the NCSE are worth considering. Deputy Harty has studied them, and I believe the recommendations made are really exciting. The proposals are for changes which are similar to the changes we made to the resource teaching model where, instead of requiring a diagnosis to be made, with provision following only after a diagnosis and the delay that becomes inevitable due to the need to find a psychologist to make a diagnosis, we are now proposing to front-load the allocation of SNAs to the school. This will ensure that, before a child arrives, a profile of the school has been created and the child can expect to get access to an SNA without necessarily having to produce a diagnosis ahead of time. That change, if implemented, will be a great relief to parents. It will constitute a shift from the current model and it will deal with many of the frustrations. It will also remove much of the administrative hassle some Deputies referred to, where school principals are having to submit forms, wait for applications and deal with large amounts of paperwork. If we go along with these proposals, which I believe are very solid, the allocation will be front-loaded into the school.  As a result of the changes proposed, there will also be more job security for special needs assistants. The Deputies have rightly pointed out that there is uncertainty about the position of an SNA because an SNA has traditionally been allocated to an individual child. When the child leaves the school, and if the school no longer has children with the profile of need, it loses the SNA because he or she is linked to the identified need. The SNA has a contract, but one which is linked to an identified need. Of course, a redundancy payment is made if the contract is terminated. In 2013, under the Haddington Road agreement, a supplementary panel was introduced, meaning that if an SNA lost a post in one school, he or she could go onto a panel and could then get first option for posts elsewhere. This was a significant improvement, which has dramatically reduced the number of SNAs who become redundant and cease to continue. High numbers of SNAs now continue on, even though their posts may change. If we move to the new model, it will provide far more job security because SNAs will be front-loaded into the school and will not be so closely linked to individual pupils. That will improve the system.  The other major proposal from the NCSE is that resources would be ring-fenced in areas of therapy that could dramatically broaden the scope of what can happen in a school. We have already piloted this idea for speech and language and occupational therapy in 75 schools and 75 pre-schools. At the moment, a child might meet a therapist once in nine or ten weeks and between visits nothing happens. In future, these schools will have the capacity, built into the school by speech and language therapists, to continue working between those episodes. Both the teacher and the SNA would continue to support the speech and language capability of the child between visits to the therapist. We believe this will have a much higher impact for our investment in speech and language therapy and a much better outcome for children. We have to test this idea in real life, so the pilot scheme has been set up involving 75 schools and 75 preschools in community health organisation, CHO, 7 of the HSE, in Wicklow, Kildare and parts of west Dublin. The idea is being tested.  We have to implement these proposals carefully. We learned from the resource teaching model, which was piloted in 47 schools. There was a proof of concept before we moved to provide the programme nationwide. That is very important. Deputy Harty has asked why we cannot act more quickly. It is very important that we build confidence in the model and demonstrate that it can work in order that we can go back to Government to seek support for such an approach.We have to show what it will cost and what impacts it will deliver, get approval for a pilot and then move to implement it on a broader basis. I am convinced that this will result in a significant improvement in the way we do this. What the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is saying does not just apply to speech and language and occupational therapy, but also to many areas in which children attending school need specialist support that cannot be delivered within the school. We will have regional teams that will provide such support and they will work to build the capacity of schools to handle more complex cases.  This is a significant breakthrough. In regard to ensuring that special needs assistants, SNAs, are properly treated, under the Haddington Road agreement, we carry out an annual review of the supplementary panel system. I meet the trade unions regularly and I attend the Fórsa annual trade union conference to listen to the affected staff. We also engage in consultations. For example, when the NCSE consulted the representatives of SNAs there was an SNA on the team. Special needs assistants are invaluable education stakeholders and we need to support them.  I welcome this debate because it contributes to work that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, will have to do over the coming years to build an even stronger model to support children with special needs. I am glad there is a fair degree of consensus in the House about the direction of travel.

For the information of Members, the amendment simply asks the Minister to set out the steps he intends to take to implement what the NCSE has recommended regarding special needs assistants. I will share time with several colleagues.  The Minister looked back over the period of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government with rose-tinted glasses. He maintained there were no cutbacks to SNAs during that Government. He has clearly forgotten the major protests against cuts to SNAs and resource teaching hours in 2013 and the fact that, as early as September 2011, my party leader raised this issue on Leaders' Questions. The record of the Fianna Fáil Party and my leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, on SNAs is second to none. If it were not for Deputy Micheál Martin, we would not have the system of SNAs that we have in place now. Deputy Martin introduced the automatic entitlement to special support under the Education Act 1998. The number of SNAs increased under that policy. Why do we have SNAs and what is the reason for the increase in their number? It is to ensure that all children can have access to their local school and an education. In many cases, they can only access that right to an education through the support and assistance of SNAs. I thank the Rural Independent Group for introducing the motion, which Fianna Fáil is delighted to support. It provides a timely opportunity to discuss this issue. At some point the Minister will need to flesh out in more detail what he proposes to do about SNAs on foot of the review. Like the Minister, I attended the Fórsa trade union conference where I was delighted to meet SNAs, as we all do on a regular basis as part of our roles as Members of Dáil Éireann. Clearly there are major issues, specifically labour issues and issues of respect. The word that hit me most as I left the conference was "respect". Many special needs assistants feel they are not respected, sometimes by other staff in schools but also by the Government's policy of applying unequal pay scales for younger SNAs. The general feeling at the conference was one of a lack of respect. The report of the National Council for Special Education is a very good document. We do not agree with everything in the report, some of which needs to be further examined. However, one of the points that comes through is that SNAs are not always doing the job the State employs them to do, that is, helping and supporting children with special needs. The NCSE report gives a number of examples of other roles that SNAs are carrying out, including teaching, which they are not qualified to do. In some cases, this reflects the lack of teachers. SNAs also tend to be the people who do the odd jobs around the school or the jobs that others do not want to do. That has to stop. SNAs need to be able to do the job we expect of them and which they view as their role, namely, the role set out in the Education Act 1998 enacted by this House. SNAs want to be trained to the highest possible standards for that role, a point which is mentioned in the motion. That is something that we support and aspire to, and to which the NCSE also aspires.  The Minister says he needs time to consider the NCSE's report and to try to implement it. However, he has been a little slow off the mark, because some aspects of the report are deemed urgent by the NCSE. One of these concerns complex medical needs. The report states that the NCSE wrote to the Minister in early 2017 to highlight a major crisis regarding complex medical needs and noting that nursing support should be provided to schools, SNAs and teachers to address those needs. The report is quite stark on this point, stating that if something is not done, there will be a crisis in schools. This issue needs to be addressed urgently. The report notes that the Minister responded by establishing a working group, but here we are, about a year and a half after the NCSE warned of a crisis in schools if nursing support was not provided, and the Minister has still not made an announcement on the provision of nursing support in schools. This is a key urgent recommendation of the NCSE review. I pay tribute to the National Council for Special Education. I would like the Minister to set out exactly when he expects this nursing support, which is deemed so urgent, to be provided. If a medical emergency occurs, and emergencies could well be taking place under the radar in schools, there is no doubt that the absence of nursing support in schools as a result of the failure of the Minister to make a decision on this matter could lead to him and his Department being found liable. They have certainly been warned by official advisers that such support is urgently needed. I urge the Minister to take a proactive approach and give schools and SNAs the support they need to deal with complex medical needs. SNAs are not qualified to administer medications or apply dressings that may be necessary for certain students and they need support.  We support the motion. We support SNAs who do a wonderful job and we need to ensure they can continue to do so. They must be kept in post, given permanent jobs and careers and trained properly to do their jobs. Fundamentally, as the comprehensive review states, we need to ensure that the right of children to access education in their local school is fulfilled. Primary education is a constitutional right, and the SNAs are very much part of the fulfilment and execution of that constitutional right.

They and the families of the students they assist deserve better treatment than they are currently receiving. As Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on disability, I work closely with SNAs and the families of the students they assist. Right across my constituency of Cork South-West, families are looking for SNAs for their children. Others are looking for extra hours, and some are still waiting for assessments to see if they can receive the help of an SNA. I thank the Rural Independent Group for introducing the motion. I am a little surprised that greater mention was not made of the comprehensive review of the special needs assistance scheme. As someone with a personal interest in this area, it is important to me that children with special needs and their assistants are treated fairly. It is important that the policy put in place by Fianna Fáil in 1998 is made available without hesitation to every child with special needs and, more important, that schools are confident in the system. I pay tribute to my party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, for the significant contribution he made to special education when he was Minister for Education and Science. Without him, there would be no special needs assistants and the House would not be discussing them this evening. It is imperative that the Minister has the power to compel a school to make additional classes available where needed. However, it is also imperative that the needs of the child are recognised as being of paramount importance. The NCSE proposals for a greater range of supports to be offered via special needs assistants make absolute sense. They have a unique relationship with the child and it stands to reason that their intervention would benefit the child. However, additional training is needed to equip the SNAs in this regard. I plead with the Minister to treat our SNAs with more respect and give them the training they need. They are all very bright people and there is more in them. They can give more to the educational system if they are allowed.

We have to look back to 20 years ago when Deputy Micheál Martin, as Minister for Education, introduced special needs assistants in schools. I remember a time prior to that when community involvement schemes were trying to pick up an urgent need in our primary schools. The SNA scheme has developed, and people have been trained and have made an enormous contribution to young children's lives, empowering and enabling them to go on to live fuller lives in their communities. This is very important. I look at the review and the language coming down the tracks with regard to changing the model. Many times over the past 20 years this has been examined. From the outside looking in, there seems to be an attitude in the Department that this whole system needs to be changed fundamentally. Through the way it has been developed over the past 20 years it has contributed enormously, and any review of the special needs assistant scheme must ensure the existing model is continued and expanded further to empower the special needs assistants who do marvellous work in primary and post-primary schools the length and breadth of the country. This brings me to the issue of pathways to get resources and diagnoses, and there really needs to be a critical examination of how all of this is panning out. Some parents feel they have to get a diagnosis of special needs for their children to access the services. There has to be a simplified way of doing it and making sure that smaller primary schools have the same access as larger primary schools, and that parents can make a decision for their children to go to any smaller school. Special needs assistants have done an enormous job. They have contributed enormously to our society over the past 20 years and we must compliment them. We must compliment school management also. In whatever review is done by the Department what has to be sacrosanct is that the best available support is made available to young children as they go through primary and post-primary schools and, at this stage, through the various preschool programmes, such as the access and inclusion model, AIM, and not dismantle what has been done. At several stages over the past 20 years there have been attempts to try to dismantle it or put the genie back into the bottle. The scheme is working. Perhaps there are resource issues, but they cannot stop how we go forward. I thank those who tabled the motion and those who are contributing to it. Do not change the whole system. In whatever reviews are done, make sure the core remains to ensure the best possible outcomes for children.

I acknowledge the Rural Independent Group for tabling this positive motion. It is all about ensuring that children at all stages in education have an inclusive learning environment, equal access and full participation. These are core values for Fianna Fáil, which is why we have seen such a dramatic increase since 1997 in the number of special needs assistants in our classrooms. Special needs assistants play such a significant role with students because of the unique relationship they have with them. Because they are there for a particular need there is much more vulnerability about their jobs, and this is a worry for the special needs assistants themselves and for the children and their parents. The Minister referred to the change in the chaotic practice we have seen in allocating special needs assistants at the last minute and it is good this is being corrected. For many years, we have seen things happen at the last minute and this has put stress on the children and on the special needs assistants and their families. The comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme recently published by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, set out clear recommendations and there should be a timetable laid down for when they will be implemented. According to the Fórsa trade union survey, it is very clear that more and more training is needed. People should be respected in their roles and training should be made available to them. Tá ról an-tábhachtach ag an SNA sna seomraí ranga, ag tacú le páistí síos agus suas agus timpeall na tíre. Caithfear meas a léiriú do na daoine seo agus don ról tábhachtach atá acu ag tacú lenár bpáistí sna scoileanna gach lá.

I commend the motion and I commend the amendment tabled by my colleague. At a meeting of the education and skills committee this evening, we dealt with the area of special education for approximately three hours. It was a very interesting and informative debate, particularly with regard to coming here afterwards. The reason the committee had the debate was that we decided to have a specific meeting on the topic to ensure all children would and should be given equal opportunities to be educated in the environment that suits them best, preferably in their own community, helping them to reach their personal potential and to thrive. The role of the SNA is exceptionally important in this. As do many of us, I deal on a day-to-day basis with parents, teachers and schools who have been dealing with a complete lack of clarity about the number of special needs assistants the schools will have. This has added to a lot of chaos in the years up to now. I accept the situation will improve, and this is very important. Last summer there were significant delays which led to significant disruption for teachers, parents and schools and deep uncertainty for the special needs assistants themselves. It is wrong they have employment uncertainty. It is wrong they do not have access to training. In very many situations, as we have seen in some of the surveys carried out by the NCSE, the special needs assistants have added in a huge way to the positive experience of children with special needs. Last month, the Government announced a pilot project with 150 schools and preschools taking part. I welcome this. It will be in CHO7, which includes my constituency. I certainly would welcome more detail on this. Going back to the 18-month comprehensive review by the NCSE, there is no doubt there are many students who would not be able to attend school without continuing SNA support. To get better outcomes for the children, we need to respect the role the SNAs play and we need to ensure they have certainty of tenure, that the school and the board of management have certainty about that tenure, and that everybody can work in collaboration to ensure the most positive learning environment possible for a child with special needs.

I am glad to hear the chaotic practices of allocating special needs assistants to schools at the last minute will come to an end. Last summer, schools faced significant delays with the allocation of special needs assistants. This situation has persisted over recent years, and delays have meant that special needs assistants were only allocated to children well after the schools were closed for the summer. This created great uncertainty and disruption for schools, parents and the special needs assistants themselves. Each year, school principals and boards of management have had to endure the weekly charade of waiting to hear whether the Minister of the day had decided to announce allocations to meet additional special needs that arose as a result of demographic changes and increases in the number of individual students assessed in their own schools. I have had a number of cases in my constituency whereby young children with special needs due to start school in September were advised by the school principal that they could not be guaranteed a place as the school did not have enough special needs assistant support to cater for them.This is a totally unacceptable case. A family with a special needs child should have no uncertainty about the child starting school and particularly whether he or she would be accepted in a local school. This school principal found it impossible to plan and did not know the level of service she could offer. This had a serious impact on families. Families with special needs children have enough problems in trying to cope without having this added pressure. I have said many times that governing is not the accounting service Fine Gael seems to think it is. Government is about implementing policy in a timely way to ensure people receive the service they deserve in schools. The service provided by SNAs is invaluable. It can be unbelievable the way a child can be transformed when the proper service is available. It is absolutely imperative that we get the SNA service in schools right from now on.

I acknowledge the invaluable work of special needs assistants. We cannot underestimate the difference they make to a student. They can be the difference in allowing a student to attend mainstream school and very helpful in dealing with any issue being experienced by the student, not just from an educational perspective. They are an excellent support for students, even those in the classroom who may not require or qualify for an SNA. I have direct experience of how good they are, as I have seen in my son's classroom how they have helped many children, not just the student to whom they have been assigned. They go above and beyond the call of duty. There are nearly 35,000 students with additional needs and it is important that they be supported and allowed to reach their full potential. In April 2015 the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made several promises to tackle the problems in working conditions for special needs assistants in schools. Unfortunately, we still have no proper job security or permanent contracts for SNAs and they are a key element of the motion which refers to a full-time and permanent contract. There are cases where we know a student will require a special needs assistant from junior infants to sixth class, but there is a crazy process whereby every year the person must apply for the job. He or she does not know if he or she will be kept on in the post and this has a knock-on effect for the rest of his or her life. For example, it may be very difficult for such persons to qualify for a mortgage or even a basic credit union loan if there is no job security or a permanent contract. We must think of how these elements relate to the issue. It is not good enough to just say we want to try to support students and parents. We need to act and ensure special needs assistants are given support and whatever training they believe they need to carry out their role. I will mention St. Rose's in Dublin, a reading school for children with dyslexia. This September it will have no special needs assistants. Three pupils have been diagnosed as needing a special needs assistant in the coming September, but none has been assigned. As this is a school that deals, in particular, with dyslexic children, it is difficult to know how that has happened. I welcomed the increase in the allocation of special needs assistants which we thought was a great step forward, but a number of parents are still coming to me to say they are struggling and having difficulty in qualifying for a special needs assistant. Therefore, it is difficult to see how this comes together; there was an announcement of additional special needs assistants, but it does not seem to be playing out in practice. I also agree with the motion which proposes that substitute work be taken into consideration to enable special needs assistants to gain entry to the supplementary assignment panel. It would be a really good move and help many people currently engaged in substitute work who may find themselves ineligible for inclusion in the panel. Continuous professional development is recognised as being vital in changing roles, especially when working with children. There are also the various needs of children; therefore, it is important that special assistants be given access to such professional development. Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned respect. The best way to respect somebody's very important role in society is through rewarding that person in his or her terms and conditions and by providing a permanent contract and ensuring correct pay. We must give the people concerned continuous training. This is a really important role and we must ensure we do not lose people. We see a crisis in the teaching sector as teachers are not staying in the role. This could potentially happen with special needs assistants too if we do not change the sector. We cannot ask people to stay in precarious jobs in which they do not know if they will have a contract. It is not the reality of people's lives. They need to know as much as possible where they stand. Having a permanent contract is key. We support the motion.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	421	I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing the motion before the House. The following may be a cliché, but that is only because it is true. We can judge a society by how it treats its most vulnerable. Young children with special needs seeking an education are certainly vulnerable. Despite the strength and resolve they demonstrate every day in overcoming obstacles, much of their success is at the whim of those tasked with providing essential services to support them in their education. It then follows that the treatment of those tasked with supporting these children is an indication of how we mean to treat the children. If we offer poor wages and conditions, with instability, to those most valuable assistants for the children concerned, we are setting the bar very low in valuing their efforts. Frankly, it is a great shame that being a special needs assistant is a role that continues to be unstable and unreliable for those work in it. It is a matter of policy. It has been decided that these roles are not worth ensuring or protecting and those who work in them are expendable because the children they assist are less valuable. Instead of valuing these workers, we take them for granted. They deserve stable work and decent conditions. The children for whom they work deserve to know that they will receive assistance when they need it. Instead, special needs assistants' hours have been cut. That is why in the run-up to the last budget Sinn Féin indicated that money was available to employ an additional 500 SNAs at a cost of approximately €20 million. Unfortunately, the proposal was ignored and instead the Government cut the universal social charge for higher earners. There are 14,000 SNAs in the State and they do not have job security or the support to provide the assistance that they know young people for whom they work will need. They are being asked to take on new responsibilities as part of a reform process. They will have to broaden their role and will need to meet a higher bar of qualification. This may be what is best for the service, but we cannot ask more and give nothing. We need more SNAs who must have more security than before. If their role is to be expanded, support by way of professional development should also be provided. I support the motion and ask all others to do so also.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	422	I welcome the debate and thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward the motion. It is almost 25 years - much has happened in the meantime - since the right to a mainstream education was won through court action by parents of children with special needs. That is how all this came about. In fairness, most children today are able to receive the support they need to stay in education. I know many of them and lobby the Minister regularly on behalf children who receive some special assistance but who need more. I can think of children who are at school. There is one child with Down's syndrome who needs assistance, but it was cut last year and the year before. The child is sharing an SNA and really struggling in comparison with where she was three or four years ago. As she reaches the end of primary school and goes to secondary school, it will be more difficult to obtain SNA support. I recently came upon the case of a seven year old child with type 1 diabetes.The child is regularly going low and has passed out several times in the classroom. She needs a full-time permanent special needs assistant. Again, it has been recommended that she share a special needs assistant with another child. We see the same situations in schools throughout the length and breadth of the country. The comprehensive review was carried out but we need everything in the review to be implemented immediately. I understand a pilot scheme will be run in the south east. That is to be welcomed but we need the scheme rolled out throughout the country. At the moment, children on the autism spectrum cannot really be diagnosed until they are seven or eight years of age. That is normally when the diagnosis takes place. These children need care and intervention long before that. However, in the situation we have at present they are not getting that care. The essence of the motion is that the recommendations of the comprehensive review need to be brought into action as quickly as possible. I welcome many of the Minister's comments in that respect. Unfortunately, however, the reality of the situation is that we have more children at school and the school population has grown. With this growth, the demand for special needs provision has grown as well. I expect and understand that the Minister will put forward the position that since 2011 the number of SNAs has grown by 50%. However, we need to see the number grow by a further 50% to meet the need that exists. The motion states that we need to put action in place immediately. I commend the motion and I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing it forward.

It is a good motion and it is good to have this debate in the Dáil. Special needs assistants provide an invaluable service in our schools. They play a key role in our mainstream schools by helping children with special educational needs to learn with their peers in an inclusive way. While many parents and teachers appreciate the support and assistance that SNAs give to children to help them to navigate the mainstream school system, the Government consistently undervalues and under-appreciates the important role they play. Only last year, SNAs decided they had no option but to vote overwhelmingly for industrial action. This was borne out of immense frustration at what they saw as the Government's failure to listen to and address their mounting concerns. Will the Minister indicate whether there are any plans to review the supplementary assignment panel with a view to giving more rights to SNAs who are made redundant? That is an important question and I call on the Minister to address it in some format. I call on the Government to delay implementing the recommendation of the recent National Council for Special Education review until it consults with more than 9,000 SNAs who have union representation. Why did the NCSE fail to do this in the first place? It is important to consult with the union representing 9,000 SNAs. I urge the Government to consider allowing SNAs sit on school boards of management to help address the power imbalance. That would allow SNAs to have a say in matters relevant for them. SNAs play an integral part in schools and I believe they should have some sort of formal representation on boards of management, if possible. This is an important teaching and supervisory role in schools. SNAs should have a more democratic say in the schools where they work and teach.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	424	I urge all special needs assistants in the country to get organised if they are not already organised. They should join a union if they are not already members of a union. The special needs allocation for schools for the following year was announced in the month of July in each of the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 - four years in a row. When SNA allocations are announced in July, it creates tremendous uncertainty for the individual SNAs. It means they finish the previous school year without knowing if they will be back in September. It also creates uncertainty for the school and students. That is the essence of precarious work. I wish to highlight the precarious nature of this work. Where a school allocation is reduced the SNA will lose the job. The SNA then has to go on a panel and apply for jobs in the locality. However, to go on the panel the SNA must have one year of service. However, the SNA cannot include, as part of one year of service, any work done while substituting for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job sharing and so on. This really underlines the need for permanent contracts. On account of such experiences, more and more SNAs are joining unions. Late last year, SNAs balloted for strike action on precisely this issue. The vote was not 50% plus 1%. It was not 60% or 70%, which would be high for a strike ballot. In fact, 97% voted in favour. What happened this year? Two things happened this year. First, 940 new posts were announced for the following year. The announcement was not made in July or June but in the month of May, which is when it should always have taken place. I am strongly of the view that would not have happened were it not for the fact that SNAs joined trade unions and balloted by 97% in favour of strike action. It is a glimpse of what people can achieve when they organise and join a union. This approach now needs to be extended to all the other key issues facing SNAs. I wish to conclude on the question of training. Many people have the idea that SNAs are poorly qualified. SNAs are far from poorly qualified. The notes I have before me will prove it. A survey was organised by the education division of Fórsa earlier this year. The union surveyed 2,700 SNAs. The majority had been in the job for ten years or more. The survey found that 97% of SNAs hold qualifications beyond the required Further Education and Training Awards Council level 3, which requires three junior certificate grade Ds or equivalent. A majority held either FETAC level 5 or level 6. Some 11% had attained an ordinary degree and 10% had attained an honours degree. A further 10% had a leaving certificate. Yet, the position is that the vast majority of SNAs who have undertaken extra training over and above that level have self-financed the training or have been assisted by the trade union movement. The amount of official training provided by the Department and the system as well as the amount of professional development, let alone continuing professional development, is negligible in comparison. This situation needs to end. We need recognition of the qualifications of SNAs. We need to improve upon it by putting training and facilities in place. If the Minister and the Department do not deliver on that, the unions should force change on the issue as they have done on the timing of allocations.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	425	We adjourned a discussion on the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which tries to deal with the insecure and unequal way workers are treated in the retail industry. Now, we have come to another area of work that involves mainly women. I am referring to those who work as SNAs. They are in insecure jobs similar to the workers we were dealing with through the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I too appeal to the workers in this area to join a union. I appeal likewise to workers in childcare and those in the English teaching sector because it is the only way such workers can push an issue onto the agenda. I fully support the motion and I thank the Rural Independent Group for introducing it. I urge the Minister to seriously address the issues raised. I wish to offer an example of a situation in St. Dominic's college in my area. I believe it shows the precarious nature of the work for SNAs and the associated complications. Last month, the school let go two SNAs as several children were finishing up at the end of the year and on the basis of the hours there was no longer work for them.There might be work next year but there is none now. Two of these special needs assistants, SNAs, went on the panel and one has a job for September. The reduced hours mean that the next person has had her hours reduced from full time to 0.33 of a position, that is, two hours and five minutes every day Monday to Friday. She earns about €220 every two weeks, having gone from full-time hours to 0.33 of a position. This woman is married with two children and she has been reduced to working only ten hours 25 minutes per week. She is unable to go on the panel for full-time hours as she has a job. If she left her job, she could not go on the panel because the job has to be suppressed for a person to go on the panel or take redundancy. She cannot get jobseeker's benefit for the extra hours because the job is over five days, Monday to Friday. She is really getting kicked around the place. There is no way anyone could stand over a worker being subjected to such conditions. She has applied for full-time positions in eight schools but because she has no panel rights, she is not getting them. She feels financially penalised and prevented from earning a full wage. The Minister cannot stand over that and it must be addressed. The motion is calling for permanent contracts for these workers. They cannot be treated like second class citizens, or third class ones, as is the case here. This woman has more experience than the SNAs who were let go, because it was a case of last in first out, but she is getting these low hours. It is crazy. This woman is earning a quarter of her old wage and has no expectation of earning more unless additional children come into the school and increase her hours. Can the Minister stand over this inherent inequality? Crucially, SNAs are also impacted by FEMPI. SNAs on post-2011 contracts earn €12 an hour whereas the person I spoke to was earning €18 an hour, she was employed prior to 2011 and was on the eighth point of the scale. That issue must also be addressed.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	426	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue of the circumstances of special needs assistants. SNAs are the vital links between children with special needs and the school community. This important relationship should be protected and supported in every way. However, the cuts imposed on SNAs to date have disproportionately impacted on children with disabilities and their future prospects as a result. For that reason, I welcome the 18-month review of the SNA programme which called for the broadening of the roles of SNAs from the current model of basic care provision to the assistance of delivery of speech and language and occupational therapy. However, I call on the Government to put in place the necessary supports, financial or otherwise, so that the burden of implementing the new system is not put entirely on the shoulders of SNAs. I am delighted to hear that under the new system it will no longer be necessary for a child to receive a diagnosis of disability in order to access SNA services. Under the new model they will receive additional training and will be known as inclusive supports assistants. I hope that under the new model pupils will have unfettered access to necessary supports based on their needs rather than a disability diagnosis, which should have always been the case. I am also concerned over whether the Government will provide funding for existing SNAs to attend a national training programme if they do not have the requisite level of relevant training or for inclusion support assistants on appointment. I also call on the Government to look at existing inequalities in special needs provision in schools across the country. The Irish Times recently found that 29% of mainstream secondary schools have special classes which rises to 42% in DEIS schools. However, it is interesting that there are no special classes in the 52 secondary schools that make up the fee-paying sector. This should be looked into, and seriously, because it makes a lie of the idea that education is for everybody. The only thing that they recognise is the ability to pay.  Now that we have got rid of the baptism barrier, we need to look at the soft barriers used by schools which claim that they do not have room or resources for special classes even though money should follow the student. Schools must be stewards of inclusivity and pave the way for all children regardless of ability to lead full and complete lives full of opportunities on an equal footing to each other. Let us hope that the Government's treatment of this new model departs drastically from its own past actions and treatment of the education system so far so that they can do more than provide an education but also provide for the growth and stability of the people who need it.

#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	428	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. We must all recognise that the special needs assistant scheme is vital in ensuring the integration of children with special needs into mainstream education and the positive role SNAs play in the development of children in schools. They must be thanked for the great work they do and the way that they bring children forward. They play a key role in supporting children who have additional care needs to attend school and participate in education. It is difficult to get onto the SNA supplementary assignment panel as an SNA is required to have a minimum of one year's service. However, service in a substitute capacity, that is, covering maternity or sick leave, career breaks or job sharing does not count. Parents have to fight and are rightfully very anxious that their child gets the necessary special training to bring their child to the same level as the other children. It is clear that children who have the greatest need require intervention from a very early age. Most improve greatly as a result. Sadly, some may not especially those who are not assisted in time. Sometimes these children reach adulthood and become physically very strong and become a worry to their parents. Often they present with mental health issues and sometimes can even be a threat to their parents. In Kerry there are few supports, if any, for these children or grown-up adults. Parents have no respite or assistance. I know one poor mother who must lock her door every night because she is afraid of her son. One mother in north Kerry lost her life after her son killed her. Each year, principals and boards of management spend significant time making applications for SNA supports in their schools. We call on the Government to provide job security for SNAs by providing permanent contracts. One SNA who was in a position for over 12 years has been made redundant twice in the last three years. That is not good enough.It has to be recognised that SNAs carry out several different duties in the schools including toileting, facilitating students' mobility, escorting students around the school, feeding and dressing. It is an intense job, mentally and physically. One is on the go for all the hours one is in the school. I ask the Minister to give us the support we are looking for in this motion.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	429	I thank David and Máirín McGrath in the office of our Whip, Deputy Mattie McGrath, for the work they have done in preparing the Private Members' motion which we are bringing before the House. I thank SNAs throughout the country. They play a vital and important role. I see it at first hand when dealing with school management and parents' committees that are tasked with trying to run our schools, along with the principals and teachers. The role of SNAs is actually vital. Not one of us can really put our finger on the reason educational needs have changed so much over the last 20 years. Perhaps it is down to the diagnosing of the problems that students have. We are able to put names on the different learning difficulties of students. That is why we are able to recognise that special needs assistants are required in the schools. They play a vital role. Job security is of major importance. There are young people who go away and get education and then become special needs assistants, but they do not have job security. They are left in limbo. They have mortgages too. They have loans for motorcars to get to work. They are trying to live their lives and rear their own children and they do not have job security. That is something about which I feel very strongly. The Minister spoke here earlier, as he did a couple of weeks ago. I refer to commitments given by this Government and others which were not kept. That is why I believe that we need promises to be made but also to be kept. We need finance to be given and assured. We need schools to be able to give full-time employment to their special needs assistants. We know that the work is there for them and that it will be there for them. Therefore, it is only right and proper that they be given full-time jobs and the security and everything else that goes with that. Our own life experiences are very important in allowing us to learn of the needs some younger people have. I faced into my teens without the ability to read or write. At that time there was no such thing as special needs assistants in schools. It was very difficult for people who suffer from dyslexia. At that time it was not identified in the way it is now, which caused trouble and posed difficulties in learning. I appreciate the great work that is done every day by SNAs because of my own experiences in the past. That brings me onto the point I purposefully wanted to leave until last because I did not want to waste the time I had. I wanted to try to cover the issues that were important and to highlight the problems that we have and the whole thrust of the motion we brought forward in our group. However, I have to clarify one thing. There is one thing I take very seriously. I never in my life get up any day to insult, offend or put out anybody. I would never do such a thing. For any person inside this House to take what other people - I am talking specifically about our Whip, Deputy Mattie McGrath, and about Deputy Michael Collins and myself - have done and issues we were raising at a particular time and to go out of this Chamber tweeting and issuing press releases is hurtful.  I was very glad that my own radio station in County Kerry, Radio Kerry, allowed me the opportunity to go on and to clear my name and clarify the work I have been doing for many years. I am not a Johnny-come-lately to politics who dropped out of the sky the other day. I have been around the schools for many years. I treasure and adore the work they do, the work people do in dealing with people with special needs, and the students themselves. I adore them. I can only talk for myself but I know I have permission to talk on behalf of my colleagues, but for a particular Deputy to take it upon herself to bullyrag us around this country and to tell lies is the most hurtful thing that any person-----

The SNA scheme is one of the main components of the overall support structure for children with special educational needs which is provided by the Department of Education and Skills. In 2011 the Department spent some €1.247 billion on special educational needs. This year the Department will spend some €1.78 billion on special education needs. By any measure, this is a very substantial investment and constitutes an increase of some 42%, much of which was provided during the worst economic crisis to affect our country. This investment has enabled the growing participation of children with special educational needs in our schools and will ensure that their participation and progression within the education system continues to be fully supported. Each year more and more children have availed of the support of SNAs. This year more than 34,600 children will be supported by SNAs. That is the positive. Many children are supported to remain longer in schools than they might have in the past without this support. However, it is important that we test and review our systems to ensure that they remain the most effective and relevant form of support. For this reason the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has strongly welcomed the recently completed comprehensive review conducted by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. I ask colleagues to read it and read it again. It is a very good document and a really comprehensive review. In undertaking the review, the NCSE consulted widely with education partners and stakeholders, including SNAs and their representatives and parents and students. The recommendations of the report have taken account of inputs from all of these stakeholders, including SNAs and their representatives.The review highlighted the important role SNAs play in assisting students with additional care needs to attend school and acknowledged that the scheme is greatly valued by parents, students and schools. Recommendations for a new front-loaded model of allocation and the development of structured professional development for SNAs are very positive outcomes and their implementation would ensure this very valuable support is targeted to deliver the right supports at the right time to students with additional care needs. The SNA scheme will provide for the allocation of some 15,000 SNAs across some 3,500 schools this year. SNAs are employed by boards of management and are subject to the normal employment terms and conditions for such positions. Duties are determined by the boards of management and these are guided by Department circular 30/2014, which lists the primary and secondary functions to be undertaken by SNAs in schools. The Department is confident that the supplementary panel arrangements which are in place are sufficiently responsive to the needs of SNAs. As stated previously, the panel arrangements have been demonstrated to work effectively for SNAs and schools, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is committed to the continued effective operation of the scheme in consultation with education partners, as provided for in national agreements. Procedures are in place involving schools, school management bodies, the Department of Education and Skills and staff interests to deal with SNA grievances and issues at school and national levels, and the Department will continue to engage with staff interests and school management on SNA matters. Due to the annual increase in SNA available positions and the guidance and supplementary panel arrangements already agreed and in place, the position for SNAs has markedly improved in terms of job security and stability of employment. With the implementation of the recommendations in the comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, that will improve even further. There will be more certainty when that happens. I look forward to the Government considering proposals for the implementation of the recommendations of the NCSE review to ensure that the delivery of supports to children with special educational needs is both better and more equitable for future years, and to ensure we provide for the best outcomes possible for students with special educational needs.  Additional training and upskilling of SNAs is included in the recommendations. We welcome the motion. This is an important debate. It is important that we keep this to the fore. Thirty-four thousand six hundred and fifty students are receiving support at present. This represents a huge increase. Colleagues are correct, however, that we need to keep reviewing. We need to keep improving and doing better. That is what the Minister and Department want to do and are doing with the support of colleagues in the House. I thank my colleagues for the debate.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-26 00:00:00	Visit of Northern Irish Delegation	452	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le gach Teachta. I thank the Minister, Minister of State and all the contributors for supporting the motion and for their genuine, heartfelt support for SNAs, who do a tremendous, caring, dedicated, valuable job. As said earlier, they see it as a career or vocation. The majority I come across in Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir up to Moneygall and across from Araglin to Ballingarry, work diligently day in, day out. It is more than work; it is a vocation. They look after a very special cohort of children, who are vulnerable and who have very sensitive needs. It is a pity it had to end up in an argument because we are all passionate about this. I will not even refer to what was said in tweets and other media. Let the people decide that this is something we must reflect on with a view to offering support and better working conditions. The conditions of service need to be improved greatly. Special employment conditions need to be considered. What is occurring is totally unfair. We were debating the employment legislation earlier and seeking conditions and rights but the cohort I am referring to, who are doing such vital, valuable, dedicated work, have no real secure tenure of employment. I recognise what the Minister said and the effort he and the Minister of State are making. Tosach maith, leath na hoibre. I acknowledge that. We are not being negative. We want to be as positive as we can this evening. I welcome the report to which both Ministers referred, the NESC report. It is very timely. SNAs have been with us for a while. They were seriously affected by the downturn in the economy and the FEMPI cuts, which people seem to want to forget about. Many Deputies on my right reminded us that Deputy Micheál Martin played a role in this. Of course, he has. We all do. We want to make the conditions better and look after those affected, especially the daoine óga and those with special needs. There was a wonderful testimony from Deputy Michael Healy-Rae. He said dyslexia, dyspraxia and many such conditions were not even heard of 20 years ago. They were certainly unheard of when we were in school. My late brother was a paediatrician of some renown. He did a lot of work in this area. When he used words associated with the area, I did not know what he meant. It is a bad day on which one does not learn something. We have come a long way but we have a long way to go. The Minister referred to the fact that more children are presenting. They are. There is an earlier diagnosis, which is vital for the children. It is very important to their future. We must try to keep pace in meeting the needs because there are people presenting with conditions that did not present before. I listened carefully to Deputy Harty. The SNAs are at the front line of the service when parents present with a child who, for whatever reason, is just not able to engage practically and reasonably with their siblings and friends. The parents are worried and really upset. The parents used always be waiting until July. Deputy Barry referred to the overwhelming vote by the SNAs. There were put to the pin of their collar. They had to make their stand. I hope that, as a result of the vote and threat of industrial action, the Minister will take action. He was able to find the funding. Thankfully, we are now in a better situation financially but, as I said, mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. It is the very start for those concerned. It is their early years education.  I could not say enough about the SNAs who operate in the schools with which I am familiar. I have served on boards of management of national schools and secondary schools and I served on a naíonra. I served at all levels except third level. I am in the fourth level at the moment, learning something every day, I hope. Often we might need special assistance from the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle to keep us on track and sometimes to protect us. I listened very carefully to what the Minister said this evening. I am not sure it will prove to be of comfort to the parents in schools who are sick and tired of hearing how committed the Department is to SNAs because, nevertheless, it allows dysfunction to continue year after year. I know the Department has a job to do but it needs to empathise and walk in the shoes of the parents with the children concerned. It needs to walk in the shoes of the SNAs. I met SNAs in St. Mary's CBS in Irishtown this year. It has two special units. There were champions there in Mr. Ryan, a former principal, and the others who set them up. They make an effort. A whole-school team makes an effort and the SNAs are a vital cog in the wheel. They do tremendous work and they are dedicated and compassionate. They are attached to the children when they are in the school. They wait, ready, willing and able, for the new cohort each year. The role of SNAs is very clearly laid out in the Department's circular of 2014. It confirms that SNAs are those providing schools with additional support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs, as everybody referred to tonight. That phrase "additional and significant care needs" really goes to the heart of why this motion and issue are so important. I thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and our staff and everybody else who assisted us.  We know from the NCSE that more than 34,600 students are currently being supported and that SNAs are deeply valued. We want that to continue. The Minister mentioned the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant scheme carried out by the NCSE. That review found a broader range of support options is required to address students' additional care and support needs in schools. The Minister was talking glowingly about the report but we cannot be selective; we must dig deep into the whole comprehensive report. The National Council for Special Education considers that the broader range of support options required to address students' additional care needs includes timely access to support from personnel with relevant qualifications and a wide set of skill sets. An example of this was provided and I want to repeat it to highlight why changes are important. A student may require support because of severe sensory processing difficulties associated with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, diagnosis. In such cases, his or her school may require support from a behaviour practitioner to assist in addressing the behaviour difficulties that arise from the sensory processing difficulties. The school may also require advice from an occupational therapist to explore environmental adaptations which could assist in reducing the level of sensory difficulty the student experiences in the first place. These interventions will help the student build coping skills, not just manage the symptoms. It is vital to intervene as early as possible. The example makes it clear what is at stake. The NCSE, as part of its review, also recommended that, in line with international best practice, students' additional care needs are identified and met through a continuum of support frameworks which includes whole-school, targeted-school and intensive-school support within an inclusive school context. That is really what parents want for their children. That is what SNAs want to deliver day in, day out, every week. It must be a wrap-around service which supports all the needs of the children, delivered by hard-working and committed SNAs with permanent job security. It is not a big ask. It is a vocation for the SNAs and they want to help. They have upskilled themselves but they need more retraining to deal with the different complexities which are thrown up with new diagnoses regularly. They need the best possible support. Above all, they need respect from their employer, the Department, which works through the boards of management. Membership of a board of management is an arduous task. Boards of management have to deal with employment legislation, health and safety regulations agus gach rud eile. The Minister must support the boards of management, the parents' councils, the teaching staff, as well as the ancillary school staff down to the caretakers. SNAs need certainty. They do not need to be told in May, June or July that they will have a contract in September. An SNA losing his or her position can be an emotional wrench. While they lack job security, they have passion, dedication, enthusiasm and a vocational spirit as educators to those young children with special needs. They impart those skill sets to the parents. Parents are happy to leave their children in school, knowing they will be cared for and properly looked after. I salute the SNAs up and down the country. The Government must put its money where its mouth is and implement - fully, not selectively - the recommendations of the report.
