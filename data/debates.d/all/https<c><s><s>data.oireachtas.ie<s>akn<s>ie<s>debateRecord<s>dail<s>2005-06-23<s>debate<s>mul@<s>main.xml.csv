The House takes a sos on Wednesdays when it sits for the number of hours proposed for today. Party spokespersons on justice, who will spend most of the day dealing with the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, will also have to be present in the House for Question Time with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this afternoon, and we are expected to sit in the Chamber without a break until 8 o'clock.

It also amounts to appalling treatment of an Garda Síochána that a Bill of this magnitude, importance and sensitivity, with 284 amendments yet to be debated, is expected by the Government to go through all Stages by 8 p.m. this evening. This is contemptuous treatment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the Garda Síochána and the representatives of all parties and none.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Yes, but we are expected to consent to have the debate on the Garda Síochána Bill end at 8 p.m. this evening. Even if only two minutes were given to the consideration of each amendment, ten hours would be needed. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources knows, as a former Government Whip and a Minister now serving in Government, that this is not right. We have evidence over the years of rushed legislation being taken to the Supreme Court. Such legislation does not work out. As was pointed out yesterday by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and others, there are very serious matters pertaining to the dismissal of members of an Garda Síochána, definitions of rights of account and so on, that should not be rushed through the House. I warn the Minister and the Government that to do this today is not good practice, that it will make bad law and that they may well live to regret it.

The green list of amendments circulated this morning says the 284 amendments comprise all the amendments to the Bill. They do not. There are further amendments in the white paper from the Minister. Last night we got only as far as amendment No. 12, which means most of the amendments will never be discussed in Dáil Éireann. How can any Minister defend that? It is quite unconscionable.I mean no disrespect to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, but the Tánaiste is in the car park talking on her mobile phone. The Taoiseach will not come to the House and it now appears the Tánaiste will not do so. We do not know if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be leaving the House at any stage during the debate on the amendments. He may have to attend another photo-shoot today. On any day on which he does not speak before a large number of cameras and microphones, he goes into withdrawal.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Having hammered away for more than three weeks since the second Morris tribunal report to get the Government to respond to Mr. Justice Morris, and having extracted 12th-hour amendments from the Minister, it is a disservice to politics and to this House that we do not have the opportunity to scrutinise any of the amendments in the manner they deserve. This is a serious matter, and a serious Bill is being rushed through by the Minister at a time when there is no compulsion on this House to rise on 1 July.We can meet for an additional week and allow the 283 amendments, plus those on the white list to be debated in Committee for as long as is necessary, given the gravity of some of the amendments being discussed. It is a contemptuous way to treat the House and one must conclude that it is deliberate. Having resisted bringing forward amendments following the second Morris report and having been obliged to do so, the Minister is now insistent that he knows best and that all wisdom reposes on that side of the House. He will force through the amendments in this fashion, which is frankly disgraceful.

My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, said yesterday he and his staff are trying to do their very best under difficult circumstances. The Government and in particular the Minister is showing disrespect to this House in the way he has conducted this legislative process. It is a rush rather than a legislative process. It is regrettable that the House can be treated with such utter contempt. Rushed legislation is always bad legislation.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I strongly object to this proposal. I am not seeking to make a political point but we are dealing with a major Bill. The Minister has trumpeted it as of huge relevance to the country. That is true and it is only right that we ensure the Bill in its final form is something of which we can be proud. If one were to consider how best to produce a bad product, one could not think of a better way of doing it than to impose a guillotine in the fashion proposed by the Government.It is not just a truism to state that rushed legislation is bad legislation. There has been ample evidence of it over the years. The Minister should be well aware of this given that he caused a number of immigration Bills to be rushed through the House, which later ended up in the courts. I have been a parliamentarian for a number of years and I urge the House to do the decent thing by the Garda Síochána and by the country. Let us ensure the Bill passed by the House is one of which we can be proud.I accept that not all the 284 amendments require detailed consideration but some of them are of major significance. In fact, when the Minister presented them he suggested that they were a comprehensive response to the reports of the Morris tribunal. He indicated that they would deal with all the strictures of Mr. Justice Morris. If that is so, let us at least have the decency to examine those proposals. Let us not be faced at 8 p.m., having gone through a quarter of the amendments, with a single question from the Chair proposing that all the amendments fall other than those proposed by the Minister. We will end up with a Bill that is not even half considered.There is provision in the Constitution for the President to refer legislation to the Supreme Court to be considered for its constitutionality. Two issues will arise at the end of today's proceedings. The first is the process employed by Parliament for dealing with this Bill. That certainly runs counter to the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. If we do not give due process to the Bill, particularly a Bill of such importance, that issue will have to be considered.There is a second issue. Amendments have been put before the House which will not be given adequate consideration but which comprise new proposals for the summary dismissal of members of the Garda Síochána. These are major new powers. If such powers are to be put in the Statute Book, they must be properly considered. We must be satisfied there are adequate safeguards. Above all, we must be satisfied there is due process and that any member of the Garda who might be faced with such a decision by the Garda Commissioner will have access to a process of natural justice. On my cursory reading of the amendments presented by the Minister, I am not satisfied that there is provision for such due process. That is all I might be able to say today about those provisions because we might not reach them.My comments are not just directed at the Minister, Deputy McDowell. So far, he has had the backing of the Fianna Fáil Members of the House. I urge them to pause and reflect. In the name of goodness, let us do the proper thing by the Garda Síochána and the country. Give us a decent chance to assess the amendments properly. I guarantee on behalf of Fine Gael, the main Opposition party, that we will deal with this constructively and fairly. However, we need time to do it properly. The Government is not giving us that time.

It was a contemptuous way to treat the House. I object to the Minister's methodology and to his attitude to his presence in the House. His manner of dealing with legislation is unacceptable. We have raised this issue before and need the Ceann Comhairle's guidance. The Minister first presented this Bill two years ago. Now as the session ends he says the Bill must be guillotined and presents a stack of new amendments.He does this with every Bill. On leaving this House every Bill is more than double its original size, through amendments from the Minister — he does not accept our amendments. He never thinks out fully what he intends to do and as a result we receive an ad hoc amalgam of legislation that is a set of proposals without any coherent philosophy.In this case there are two green books of amendments, one provided the day before yesterday, one yesterday, and there are white pages of the Minister's amendments, which are not included in the normal green book because the Minister is keeping them separate for himself. This is the height of inefficiency. We must try to plough through different groups of amendments to find our place in the debate.The Minister has included 34 amendments in his booklet, making a total of more than 300 amendments to deal with today. There is not the slightest hope that we will reach the seminal amendments introduced by the Minister. Many of these are amendments to which he has agreed kicking and screaming after we insisted on having at least some debate on the reports of the Morris tribunal.We made statements only on Friday but at least we had a further debate in Private Members' time last night and the day before. There has been some attempt to tease out the implications of the Morris reports and to acknowledge that Mr. Justice Morris specifically requested this House to review the Garda Síochána Bill.Some of the Minister's amendments are good. I am pleased he has taken on our idea for a whistleblower's charter. That is an excellent amendment for which we have long pressed. I am also pleased he has taken on board several of our proposals regarding the ombudsman's commission and that it has a different shape now from when the Minister embarked on this proposal two years ago. There is a significant proposal to roll out CCTV around the country in the interests of security which is very valuable.I am not pleased, however, that these measures, plus several other controversial measures, will be nodded through without our having the opportunity to discuss them. It would have been proper to recommit them so we could have a full debate but we will not reach them on Report Stage because of the lack of time and the guillotine.One controversial amendment is the summary entitlement to be granted to the Garda Commissioner to dismiss members of the Garda Síochána, ordinary gardaí, sergeants and inspectors, that cut across the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. Both associations are angry about this because they regard it as an issue for conciliation and arbitration. Yesterday the Minister presented a summary amendment to the Garda Representative Association instead of bringing forward a proposal for conciliation.

Due process is not included in the legislation. We would seek to amend this amendment but will not have the chance to do so. Industrial action will be the outcome of this amendment.In the second controversial amendment the Minister grants himself total access to all Garda files on all citizens, at whatever stage an investigation may be or wherever documentation may be. This is an example of despotic megalomania.

My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, outlined yesterday the difficulties he and his staff experienced in trying to deal with a series of amendments.

The Minister did not want to establish the Morris tribunal.

This guillotine is more serious because of the number of constructive amendments from all sides, including the Minister, that we wish to discuss. We will not reach them.Yesterday and today the Minister said we were wasting time. The parliamentary procedure allows us to go through amendments, some of them vital. Reference was made to a discussion about the legal title of the organisation. If we cannot even get the legal title correct, how will we achieve the changes required for an Garda Síochána and get them right? One of my major points is that the amendments the Minister has tabled, some in response to the Morris tribunal's reports, are substantial yet have not been referred to the Human Rights Commission or the Garda Commissioner. I say that because the amendments go to the heart of human rights issues. There is an obligation on the Government to refer all legislation with human rights implications to the Human Rights Commission. I accept that the commission examined the Bill, but it did not know what amendments the Minister would produce.On another point, the Minister has tabled more than 70 amendments. I did not manage to count them all. We will not get through the majority. We probably will not even reach the amendment co-authored by the Minister and me. It is a minor amendment but we will not get to it, which is a pity.

We end up having to take over an entire bench for the material presented to us, never mind what reports we refer to. We do not have enough time and we should sit next week to deal with this, and the following week if need be. It is important that we get it right, since it is the first major change to the structures of the Garda Síochána since its foundation. I hope that we will not need to return with other Bills to reform it; we should take the time to get it right at this stage rather than come back with new legislation time and again to undo the mistakes made because of the guillotine being forced on us today.

Given what has been said by Deputies and in particular what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said about trying to be as co-operative as possible if extra time were allowed so that people can focus on the Bill itself in the debate, I know that the Minister is willing to grant extra time for it.

I will put the question, ''That the proposal for dealing with No. 26, the conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, be agreed to'', as it stands. The House will be aware that it has already agreed to the late sitting, to conclude at 8 p.m. It is a matter for the Whip if he wishes to make a new proposal at a later stage. However, we cannot take another proposal now, having already agreed that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Perhaps we might accept the Minister's offer of 10 p.m., provided there is no guillotine.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Does Deputy Rabbitte wish to incorporate into this a proposal that we rescind the decision that we have already made this morning? This House made a decision that we would sit until 8 p.m.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	146	That is correct.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The House has already made a decision this morning, and to rescind that, a proposal will have to come before the House.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	154	As a teller, under Standing Order 69 I propose that the vote be taken by other than electronic means.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Is the proposal for the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I do not agree. I thought there would be an Order of Business tomorrow. I am particularly concerned about the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill 2005. I understand this Bill addresses the issue of dirty bombs made of chemical or biological material. Today is the 20th anniversary of the tragedy of the Air India crash off the south coast. The potential liability for the State here is up to €9 billion. After 1 July, insurance cover will be withdrawn from a number of companies, which will potentially leave the State with massive liabilities. There are 12 pages and 19 sections in this Bill and it is to be rushed through in an hour and a half. That is not sufficient time and the Minister knows it. Deputy Mitchell on behalf of the Fine Gael party proposed inserting a sunset clause in the Bill that would return it to the Oireachtas to allow time to explore alternatives and examine whether there should be an overall European Union approach to this issue. This is of serious concern, not only because of world terrorism but because of the massive potential liability to the State. For that reason I am opposed to No. 4 on the Order of Business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	158	If we are to have Friday sittings because it suits the Government's programme at this stage, then we ought to have the Order of Business in the normal way. Three Bills will be guillotined tomorrow. The guillotine is now a regular weapon in the armoury of the Government. It is not acceptable and the Ministers denounced it when they were on this side of the House. I oppose it for these reasons.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	159	We oppose No. 4 for the reasons outlined by the previous speakers. We were also supposed to have a debate on the G8 summit, which will not now take place. That would have given us the opportunity to examine the Government's performance on this issue and particularly its failure to meet its own solemn commitments on aid. It told us it would reach the target of 0.7% of GDP. Under present circumstances we will not reach that until 2028. We want to debate this issue, particularly in the run up to the G8 summit. Many important issues are to be discussed, including climate change. It seems that once again this House will not debate these important issues.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I also object to No. 4 on the grounds that there is no Order of Business tomorrow and there are no questions to a Minister. If we are to sit, we should do so for a full day and have proper business of the House. Similar to Deputy Gormley, for a number of months I requested, and we were promised a discussion on UN reform prior to the September meeting of the UN on reform, to make proposals to be brought forward by the Government at that meeting. That should have been on the Order Paper for tomorrow as a stand alone item for proper debate and not just statements. So far we have not seen the Government's proposals on the vital issue of UN reform. If the Government is not willing to deal with it in the proper fashion then the Dáil should be recalled over the summer months so that we have some debate prior to a Government representative attending the UN reform sessions.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	161	It is most important that we have the air navigation Bill in place before the summer recess. The circumstances as outlined by Deputy Kenny are largely correct but the insurance companies are withdrawing cover for dirty bombs. All states throughout Europe, and not only Ireland, must indemnify to ensure that should such an occurrence take place people would have some recourse.It is a long established precedent that goes back to even before the time I was a whip that the Order of Business for Friday sittings is taken the day before.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	162	We will be here for a few more hours. I wish to raise two matters with the Minister on the Order of Business. The British and Irish Lions play the All Blacks on Saturday, which is of interest to Ireland. Under existing legislation, the Minister is entitled to direct that this be given free to air coverage on national television. The match is only available on Sky Sports. People cannot be in public houses or golf clubs at six o'clock in the morning. For that reason and because of the interest with four Irishmen playing on the team, I expect the Minister to intervene and make it available on national television.The issue arose today that the Revenue Commissioners are to impose full stamp duty on first-time house buyers who receive payments from their families to assist in putting down a deposit. This is against the spirit of the budget and the Finance Bill introduced last year.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	163	The Deputy must ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	164	It is particularly mean-minded and will cause great difficulty for a number of first-time buyers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The Deputy has gone outside the Order of Business.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I wish to speak on that same matter.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I will not hear the Deputy on that matter because we must move on to the business of the House. It is almost 12 noon.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I have not opened my mouth this morning.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I was not allowed by Standing Orders to open my mouth on the previous business.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The legislation on the designation of specific sports for free to air coverage is already passed. The Lions tour was not included at that time. It is not within the remit or powers of the Minister to designate it two days before the event.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The Revenue Commissioners are currently examining the issue of relief in view of the issues raised. No decision has been finalised. I understand it is not intended to limit the relief to genuine first-time buyers so much as to try to preclude the possibility of others seeking to make use of the benefit in an unacceptable way. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they are examining that issue to ensure that first-time buyers will not be penalised.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I agree with the Minister that if abuse of the relief occurs it would be entirely appropriate for the Revenue Commissioners to take this action. If it results in the savaging and further penalising of first-time buyers it would be entirely inappropriate at a time when all one has to do is read the newspapers to find other areas the Revenue Commissioners might focus on more appropriately.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I welcome the fact the Minister has accepted the concept of the ombudsman. If we accept that position, it is important the staff and resources for the ombudsman's office are put in place. I note the Minister stated it would only have half the staff of the ombudsman's office in the North. If it is to work, resources must be invested.The Minister referred to a divided, polarised society. I want to give an example of how people have been polarised and have lost faith in the system. Anyone who has attended court proceedings in the State has regularly encountered wheeling and dealing at the back of the court. Also, a situation arises whereby solicitors in cases of alleged Garda brutality, where a formal complaint has been made, recommend to their clients that they withdraw their complaints for fear of victimisation. Of 1,200 complaints processed by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, some 600 were ruled out. The usual excuse for this was that the complaints were vexatious, mischievous or time-wasting. It is clear the system is not working and that the public do not have faith in it. The office of the ombudsman would work.I was consulted by a woman whose son died in Garda custody in my area. She had not heard anything from the Garda authorities in the seven months following her son's death. The man died in Tallaght and the case was investigated by gardaí from another area. However, the family was not informed of the details. I put a question down at the time — I understand it was on 19 January last — and received a letter stating the Garda authorities had been in touch with the family. However, they were only in touch with the family on the back of my request. I informed them this was not acceptable. The woman felt let down because she did not know the reason for the delay, whereas I was told it was due to the wait for a toxicology report. Moreover, the woman's son had been in Tallaght Hospital yet nobody from the hospital had been in touch to tell her what medication he had been on. It is one example of system failure.Reference has been made in the debate to the situation in Donegal and the resignation of members of the Garda Síochána there and so on. A further example from my area involves the case of a young man, Kevin O'Reilly, who was stabbed and died. His father called for an independent inquiry but the case collapsed. That man cannot have closure on his son's death. It was another case of gardaí investigating gardaí. The father made serious allegations that many of those involved in that case may have been involved in collusion with gardaí and were Garda informers.A number of cases have arisen in my area. A young man, Stephen Hughes-Connors, died in a den in the Rossfield area. The prime suspect in the case and his girlfriend have never been interviewed. The view in the locality is that it was a slipshod investigation by the Garda Síochána. As with the other cases, the victim's mother and her family are left without closure while some of the gardaí involved in the investigation have resigned or moved on.It was always assumed there was no police corruption in this State. However, we need only examine the newspapers to find examples of it. In the past there was a crazy situation in that while there were corrupt Irish police all over the world, there were none in Ireland. That is nonsense. Gardaí have abused their positions and there has been criticism in the past, although that is not to take away from those doing positive work in the community. The involvement of gardaí in corruption undermines the force and those gardaí who have served the force well, in many cases for the best part of their lives. This is why it is important we get the Bill right and have the time to debate it.On the office of the ombudsman, I favour a single ombudsman. It is easier to identify with one individual. I listened to the Minister's point about having a chairperson and perhaps a spokesperson. However, for many the point is not whether there is one or three people but that the Minister is worried a strong, independent individual would be appointed to the position, which was a concern voiced to me. There is confusion as to why the Minister has not opted for a one-person ombudsman's office. While I noted his reference to other areas of the world, there is a question of credibility on this issue.The Minister talked in terms of simple solutions. He gave an example of the three judges of the Special Criminal Court. However, many of those aware of the workings of the Special Criminal Court will look back on the prime example of the sleeping judge. The simple solution in that instance was that there was a judge on either side to wake up the sleeping judge with an elbow. A three-person panel is not always the solution.I have no difficulty with the idea of having more people available to carry out investigatory work. Many individuals will make complaints if the system is seen to be fair. I have listened to what gardaí have said and they are not happy with the idea of being investigated by other gardaí. That is a positive move by them.Many difficulties exist and in many communities Garda credibility is on the line. If we hear of assaults in Garda stations, particularly in this city, and people constantly coming to the courts claiming they were assaulted in a Garda station, it raises the hackles of anyone in public life.It is important the Minister and the Executive listen and make themselves aware of what is happening within the Garda Síochána. I see the ombudsman having a listening role. In the past people felt it was not politically correct or right for people to criticise what the Garda Síochána did. For some unknown reason it was thought this would take away from the good work of the majority of gardaí. That mentality has weakened the position of the Garda Síochána in many communities.A number of years ago in my area we had a drug epidemic and the number of people in the area on drugs was above the national average. People were forced into going out in huts to monitor the role of drug dealers. On one occasion a stolen car in the area was recovered by people in the huts. Gardaí came to the area, recovered the car from local residents and left. Some time later a woman called to say she had heard from local gardaí that the car had been recovered and that she was coming to collect it. To my knowledge, that car was never recovered by the woman and a question mark lies over the incident. We had corrupt gardaí in Tallaght. One was expelled from the force because of his involvement with the gang that allegedly killed Veronica Guerin. There are isolated cases and individuals involved in this.It is important that procedures be put in place and that they be open and transparent. A person with credibility in the justice system should have the role of ombudsman and the selection process should reflect this. The key has to be finance and resources if we are to put in place structures that will work.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I think it unlikely we will reach section 57 so I wish to make a few comments on the ombudsman at this stage. It is vital the institution now put in place will have public confidence. I firmly believe the Minister is still on the wrong track, despite the amendments he has made. Having one of the three-person commission as a chairperson, as suggested by Deputy Costello, is an improvement but the outcome is still a fudge. I do not think the case made by the Minister for a three-person committee rather than a single ombudsman stands up.He stated that the Garda Síochána has twice the strength of the PSNI in Northern Ireland and he spoke of the need for the ombudsman to go on holidays. The public has confidence in a single ombudsman, the same type as the office of Nuala O'Loan in Northern Ireland. There is no reason a similar situation should not arise here. After all, we have a single Ombudsman in Emily O'Reilly and we have a single children's ombudsman in Emily Logan. Such a position is for one person and all of these people go on holidays. I do not accept that the practical arrangements of people going on holidays take from the point of having a single ombudsman. The public wants that and has confidence in it.At this late stage there is still time to change. The Minister is the only person who is dug in on this issue. He refuses to accept the confidence that exists in Nuala O'Loan on both sides of a very divided community in Northern Ireland. Surely that is the precedent we should follow. Despite the changes made by the Minister the outcome is still a fudge and will not bring the public confidence that is so badly needed in this new institution. I support the proposal to change the definition from an ombudsman commission to an ombudsman on the basis of the substantive issue that we should have a single ombudsman. That is what people want and the Minister is not giving it. This is the last chance to do it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I strongly support amendment No. 12, which is very important. This is an important issue that goes to the core of the debate, and the amendment strengthens the legislation. On Committee Stage we had seen historic cross-party agreement on the importance of an ombudsman in dealing with the Garda Síochána and policing generally. This opportunity was missed by many people, including some outside the Dáil. On Committee Stage all the different parties and the Independents agreed strongly on the urgent need for a single ombudsman to deal with the issue.This was based on the experience of Northern Ireland. It is also based on international good practice. Despite 30 years of conflict, there is not one person in the House, as far as I am aware, who has concerns about the professionalism and integrity of a person of the calibre of Nuala O'Loan. History will record that this ombudsman has made a major contribution to peace and to the concept of winning trust in communities that did not trust or respect police forces. I know this from many friends in Northern Ireland, particularly those in Nationalist areas, who suffered for years and had no confidence in policing. Here is an opportunity for us to have a similar situation and to have a single ombudsman. As other Deputies have mentioned, we have it in other areas, so there should be no major problem.There is a deeper issue here. If there is a question of trust in our police force and in the investigation and accountability of the Garda Síochána I find it strange that people have a problem with this concept. All public servants, including gardaí, bin collectors, teachers and nurses or doctors in the health service should have no problem being accountable to the taxpayers of this State if they are genuinely committed to the concept of public service. This is an important principle in the debate on democratic values in Irish society today. Recent events have damaged the integrity of many people who work in different sectors of the public service. There is a cry from those people that they want to be responsible, accountable and they want openness and transparency.Amendment No. 12, from Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh, is part of the modern, progressive tradition that is emerging in Irish society. It is a very important amendment and it is up to everyone in the House to support it. We cannot talk to the McBreartys, the McConnells and the Barron family if we do not do something sensible and logical in this legislation.Members of the Garda Síochána should be the guardians of the peace at all times. They must earn the support and respect of the community. At the moment we have a major problem which we as Members of the Oireachtas must face. There is a major crisis of confidence in some sections of the force and on the broader issue of policing generally.Amendment No. 12 would make a major impact and would go a long way towards developing quality community policing with integrity. We cannot allow a situation to continue whereby people are not accountable. An independent Garda ombudsman is required who will have public confidence and trust. Many talented people in this State would be excellent candidates for that particular job. People who have the interests of society at heart would be delighted to take up such an opportunity.I urge all Deputies to support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment No. 12. I ask the Minister to leave aside his political baggage and try to examine the amendment logically, sensibly and objectively. The amendment is good for taxpayers and citizens generally. It is also good for the well being of the Garda Síochána.

Earlier this week, the former Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, made a number of interesting comments about the obligation on Government to be amenable and accountable for its actions through the Oireachtas and about the responsibility of the Oireachtas to ensure Government accountability, through this House, to the public. These comments are particularly relevant to the case which was made here yesterday by my colleague Deputy Howlin. He spoke about the timing of the receipt of the report by Assistant Commissioner Carty concerning the matters under investigation in Donegal.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Perhaps you could hear me out, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, drew attention to the fact that last Friday the Minister, Deputy McDowell, informed the House that the Carty report was not delivered to him or to the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, at a time when its full contents would have definitely been of interest to them and would have enabled them to make earlier judgments on some of the issues involved. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that a partial version of the Carty report was eventually furnished in November 2001 and that the complete report was not furnished to the Minister and to the Attorney General until the very end of January or early February 2002.However, during his period as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue repeatedly indicated to the House that he had the Carty report. On 7 February 2001, in response to parliamentary questions, he did not indicate in any way that he did not have the Carty report, although he had plenty of opportunity to do so. On 23 May 2001, he stated that "the investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the DPP".Yesterday, Deputy Howlin confronted this House with a clear contradiction in the statements that have been made by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his predecessor as Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, concerning the same matter. In terms of parliamentary accountability, there is no more serious matter than a Minister misleading the House.Quite clearly, one or other of those Ministers is not telling the truth to the House. Either the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, had the report in 2000 or 2001 — as he told the House on 23 May 2001 that Assistant Commissioner Carty's report was completed and presented to him and, in turn, to the DPP — or he did not. If that version is not correct, then at the very least there is an obligation on the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to correct the record and explain to the House why he told us that in 2001. If, on the other hand, what the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated in 2001 is correct, then the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has a difficulty in terms of what he told the House last Friday. At that time he said that the previous Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, did not have the report. The Taoiseach repeated that the report was not available until 2002.This is not a minor matter concerning some incidental documentation that got lost in the amalgam of material that goes through a Minister's departmental office. This was a major report on an investigation into matters of the most serious character concerning the conduct of gardaí in Donegal. The serious nature of what occurred is now in the public domain as a result of the report of the Morris tribunal. This was about citizens of this State being stitched up by gardaí and a subsequent attempt to cover up that stitching up. I can think of no more serious matter relating to the conduct of gardaí than that contained in the Morris tribunal's report, the substance of which we now know was in the report of Assistant Commissioner Carty which was available three or four years ago.The question to which the House must have an answer is when did the Minister know that? Did he have the report or did he not have it? Is the statement made to this House by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, accurate or is the statement made by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, accurate? The House is entitled to know because Ministers are accountable to the public through this House. As a House of Parliament we are entitled to know and to be told.We are debating the Garda Síochána Bill, much of whose contents arise from the matters investigated by the Morris tribunal and which have been reported upon. We are entitled to know the facts. We have an entitlement to question and probe the matter until we get a direct and acceptable answer.Which statement is the accurate one? Is it the statement made by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in 2001 that he had the report, or the statement by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, that he did not? Other issues will arise depending on the answer to that question. If Deputy O'Donoghue misinformed the House — let me put it as gently as that — then there are questions and issues which this House will have to address concerning his stewardship as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his suitability to continue as a Minister.If the information provided to this House by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is correct, in other words, that he had the report back in 2001, as he stated, then other equally serious questions arise. They include why that report was not transferred to the then Attorney General, why the motion proposed at the time by the Labour Party seeking a public inquiry into these matters was voted down, and why the Executive maintained a position concerning the matters in Donegal, in the face of what it would then have known arising from the Carty report?We are discussing serious matters for the people directly involved. We are also talking about grave matters in terms of the accountability of Government and the Executive. I am serious when I say, "We are in resignation territory here." It is an extremely serious matter when one Minister comes into the House and says something is black and another comes in a few years later and says it is white. The situation is as straightforward as that. One or other of the Ministers is not telling the truth to the House.We are debating the Garda Bill here and no doubt, the Minister, Deputy McDowell will address the issue. I invite him to do so. There is also ample opportunity for the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to come into the House to respond to the issues Deputy Howlin raised yesterday. It is extraordinary that there has been no response by now from the Ministers concerned, a day after the charges were made. They must give a response today.

The late US President Eisenhower had a sign on his desk saying "The buck stops here." The buck must stop somewhere. With regard to the ombudsman, it must stop at some individual's desk. It cannot stop at such a diffuse arrangement as a majority of an ombudsman commission.We do not have to look far for an appropriate model. If Nuala O'Loan, in her position as police ombudsman, is good enough for Sinn Féin in the north of this island, a similar arrangement should be good enough for us. The Green Party proposes amendments based on the Northern Ireland legislation because we do not believe a committee, a commission or any other form of quango is appropriate. The office must have the authority, trust and clout to deliver. I am not convinced this legislation offers this. Therefore, I support this amendment for a single ombudsman.

Everybody agrees with the necessity of the legislation and the urgent need to deal with this serious issue. It must be dealt with now.However, in light of the questions raised by Deputy Gilmore, others and the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties this morning, there is a shadow hanging over the House and this legislation because of the need for clarification on certain issues and the veracity of statements by two successive Ministers for Justice, one of whom is the promoter of the legislation. A clash and contradiction arise from this.We should consider the article in today's Irish Examiner where the previous ombudsman sets out clearly the responsibilities of Ministers and what they should reasonably know to ensure that the buck stops somewhere. Some of us thought this was what always happened and that this is what should happen in any event. It is imperative that when the original statement was made to the House three or four years ago by way of parliamentary question, the information given was the truth. There are no exceptions.Recently, it has become obvious that there is a reluctance to give information. This reluctance is borne out by the change in the Freedom of Information Act and elsewhere. For example, yesterday approximately 25 of the parliamentary questions I asked were referred to the Health Service Executive, which will answer in due course. I got no answer in the House. Somebody outside of the House must take responsibility for those questions.There is a serious issue to be addressed. It is unfair to either Minister ——

If information is withheld from the Minister, for one reason or another, the Minister does not need legislation in order to determine what to do. This has been well established by precedent.The problem now is, apparently, that three or four years ago when the Minister was asked a question, he gave the correct answer. Or, did he? We are discussing serious legislation that will impact, for the foreseeable future, on the lives of the Garda Síochána and the people. Therefore, we must determine who told the true story at that time. Was system or ministerial failure involved? Did somebody decide that it was not in the interest of the Oireachtas to know the answer to the question? If this is so, who was it who decided to withhold the true information? This House is entitled to the answer.The information we have is that the Minister indicated at the time that he had the particular report. If he had, presumably some action would follow. We do not know. More recently we have had a correction that just an abridged version or summary of the report was available at that time. Do we know? Which version is correct? How are we expected to proceed in a debate on serious and fundamental amendments to this legislation against a backdrop of failing to get that vital information? The only way we can do that is to appeal to the Chair and its office to try to get that information for us.This is also in the interest of any Minister in order for him or her to be able to stand over the information he or she is given. If it arises that the information given is not correct, for whatever reason, procedures must be followed instantly to protect democracy. We are slipping down the democratic ladder if we depart from that.I suggest that the Chair should bring to the attention of both Ministers the content of the report in the Irish Examiner today. It sets out clearly the responsibilities of civil servants to Ministers, Governments and the Oireachtas. This has been clearly stated in recent days. If this debate proceeds without a clear and unambiguous clarification as to the veracity of those issues, a long shadow will be cast over this legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the important issue of the Garda ombudsman, or the Garda ombudsman commission, that will in due course have responsibility to ensure that all matters regarding complaints against members of An Garda Síochána are independently analysed and investigated.I want to return to the issue that is of extreme importance here. It is not simply a matter, serious as that would be, of a conflict of testimony between two Ministers on a matter of the most serious gravity. Our judgment of the conduct of the Government hinges on the issue of when the Minister and the Government had the Carty report. My information is that if they had the essence of the Carty report, it would have been impossible for them not to act and immediately acquiesce to the pressure from this House for a sworn independent inquiry into the clear evidence of wrongdoing that Assistant Commissioner Carty presented in his report. I have not seen his report, but that is the information I have. The problem is much more serious because the two Ministers whose evidence is now in diametric conflict sat around the same Cabinet table — Deputy McDowell as the then Attorney General and Deputy O'Donoghue as the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I understood before last Friday that the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, received a copy of the Carty report in the summer of 2000. My belief was based on what I was told by Deputy O'Donoghue in this House on Question Time. I quoted last night the most direct response given by the then Minister that I could find when I looked through all his responses. He said on 23 May 2001 that he had certainly received the report of Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation. My colleagues have quoted Deputy O'Donoghue's remarks of that date and I will do so again: "the investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the DPP."

The Minister, Deputy McDowell, said that:My job as Attorney General was to advise the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and also to conduct the defence of those proceedings. In that context it was necessary for me to assess as best I could all the information that should have been available to me as the legal adviser to the Government and should have been available to the legal team, for which I was responsible, conducting the civil proceedings on behalf of the State. Repeatedly during the year 2000 and into 2001, the Office of the Attorney General sought from the Garda Síochána a clear statement of the facts, as they were known to the Garda Síochána, to enable it to conduct the defence of the civil proceedings. Even after the Carty report had been furnished to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Office of the Attorney General repeatedly sought sight of that reportI emphasise that the current Minister, Deputy McDowell, said last week that when he was Attorney General, he was deprived of the Carty report even after the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had been given a copy of it. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, told the House in 2001 that the report was given to him before it was given to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Is the Minister, Deputy McDowell, suggesting that the Cabinet colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, refused to give him a copy of the report at that time? This aspect of the matter is not clear. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform went on to say last Friday:Unfortunately, it was the case at the time, doubtless in good faith, that there was a doctrine that the Garda Síochána was in privity with the Director of Public Prosecutions and that it was open to senior gardaí in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide what the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue and myself could see in respect of the investigations being carried out in Donegal.We need clarity on this matter. Differing versions of events have been presented in this House as the truth. I could give many more examples of a clear and undeniable presentation that the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, had the Carty report, or at least the essence of the Carty report, by July or early August 2000.The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday:A partial version of the Carty report was eventually furnished in November 2001, the same month in which Shane Murphy, Senior Counsel, was appointed to review the matter. The complete Carty report, as was stated last week, including appendices, was not furnished to the Minister or the Attorney General until the very end of January or early February 2002.According to the Taoiseach, they did not even get a partial version of the report until November 2001.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials have had the overnight period to consider this matter. I do not doubt that the Minister will make a further presentation to the House. I invite him to be clear and frank in his statements on this matter. He should not obfuscate. He said in the House last Friday that he was denied access to the Carty report when he was Attorney General. He told me privately that he "screamed" for the report at that time. As a consequence of not being given access to the report, he was not in a position to advise the Government adequately in advance of a Private Members' motion on the matter. The Minister has said that he wrote to then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to advise him that he was not in a position to give full advice to the Government because he had been denied access to the Carty report.It is extraordinary beyond measure that when he was Attorney General, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not resign when he was deprived of the vital information he needed to advise the Government on a matter of great seriousness. I would have expected somebody of the calibre and status of Deputy McDowell to have refused to tolerate the failure of an agent of the State to provide him with the information he needed to carry out his proper function as Attorney General, which was to give proper and full legal advice to the Government. I would have expected him to have stated clearly that he had no recourse other than to resign if he was not furnished with all adequate information. That is not what happened, apparently.When he was the legal adviser to the Government, Deputy McDowell allowed the Government to vote down an Opposition motion to establish a full inquiry, even though the full facts or their essence were known, as far as I understand, to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. It is clear that the then Minister did not communicate very effectively with the then Attorney General. The House has been told in recent days that neither the then Minister nor the then Attorney General knew anything of substance until November 2001, and that they did not have the complete picture until late January or early February 2002. It is unbelievable.I hope the House will be given some clarity, rather than more smoke, during this debate. This entire issue has been shrouded with smoke from the start. We need clarity from the Minister and the former Minister about these matters so that the Parliament is no longer treated with the contempt that Ministers clearly have for it. The House should assert itself as a working and democratic Parliament rather than a mockery.

There is consensus among those on all sides in the House, including the Minister, of the need to change the debacle that was, and still is, the Garda Complaints Board so that whatever procedure we put in place has the full confidence of the public and that it will have faith in its procedures and recommendations. One does not want a position where solicitors are recommending, as they currently do in Dublin, to clients that they withdraw their allegations or complaints about Garda brutality or misconduct because if they left them stand, they would be victimised or it would augur badly for them in the conduct of the case or future cases. That is not as it should be.I welcomed the fact the Minister was tackling the Garda Complaints Board in this Bill. I welcome the fact he moved from his original proposal and moved again on the issue of the chair because, as I said, perhaps at the end of this I will be proven wrong in two or three years' time, and so be it. The model I and others in Opposition have been putting forward is one of a single ombudsman with no commission which is already working on this island. The Minister has not shown a similar model to his which is working effectively in the same type of context which exists on this island.The model we outlined is that of Mrs. Nuala O'Loan, which has been spectacularly successful so far. She enjoys the confidence of the public on all sides and of all persuasions in politics on this island and she has been commended for that. The model we recommended is the one recommended by Senator Maurice Hayes. It is the model recommended by Amnesty International for adoption in all EU countries so as to tackle the EU wide problem of impunity for police misconduct and the need for an effective independent civilian oversight.The other aspect is there is no point in having such an ombudsman unless we give it the priority, status, resources and staff to address the significant number of complaints I believe will be received in its initial years because there are so many people out there who have no confidence in the Garda Complaints Board.I have tabled other amendments on the ombudsman being given retrospective power. We should provide for that but I doubt we will come to the amendment. Such power is necessary because the Garda Complaints Board has been so poor and people have no faith in it and did not bother to make a complaint in the first instance as they knew what the result would be.There are many cases in my area and throughout the country. Every Deputy present will have had constituents come to their offices making serious allegations against the Garda. Some of these can be borne out by their bruises or by other witnesses to Garda brutality. Others were not allegations of brutality, but just simple allegations of the gardaí not doing their job in the proper fashion. In one case, after the death of Ms Róisín Miley, her mother raised a number of serious questions regarding the procedures of investigation used by the Garda. She did not get any satisfaction in the case from the Garda Complaints Board or from the Minister.Other cases concern people who have died in custody or shortly thereafter. Mr. John Moloney of Crumlin died in 2003 and many serious questions were raised about how he was held in Rathfarnham Garda station. Was the proper procedure carried out? There were contradictory statements made. There was bruising. There were serious allegations, but yet the mechanism that existed did not enjoy the confidence of anybody, including the Garda Síochána, in addressing those concerns and the allegations that family made that their son was assaulted in Rathfarnham Garda station and died from the hiding he got there.There is another case which dates back 30 years, where a member of the Defence Forces was wrongly dismissed from the Army on the basis of incorrect Garda information. For 30 years afterwards, he has been obstructed and harassed by the authorities, in particular, by gardaí, when he has tried to vindicate his good name. The Garda records were never fully corrected. There were no apologies given to him. He was forced to go to the Supreme Court on one occasion and is looking to go again to get his name cleared and to get the mark on his previously exemplary record in the Army struck out.Many people who went through a complaints procedure, whether with the Ombudsman or the Garda Complaints Board, but particularly the latter, were forced into court because they got no satisfaction. Most of them wanted only an apology for wrongful arrest or something like that. They did not want to go to court but they were left with no other option. We are putting together something in which, it is hoped, they can have confidence. However, and this is the reason for the amendment, if there is disagreement among the three people on the commission, if they contradict each other, how can the public have confidence in the procedure? A single person can take a decision and stand over it. That would be preferable to a three-person commission whose members might disagree. I mentioned last night when speaking on the Labour Party motion that Magill and other newspapers had highlighted Garda brutality and the fact that people were forced to go to court to at least get an apology. It would be worth ensuring the ombudsman has the ability to initiate his or her own investigation and to contact those who have made allegations in the media.I met a number of constituents last week and asked them whether they had made a complaint to the Garda Complaints Board about a particular case. They related to me a horrific story about a man in Drimnagh who has been allowed to continue a reign of crime, intimidation, brutality and drug dealing for no other reason than that he is being protected by the Garda Síochána. My constituents made a complaint to the Garda Síochána that this individual had chased a car down the road with a gun. The answer given by gardaí in Crumlin to this serious allegation against a named individual was that it was okay, he was probably coked up and would not remember what he had done in the morning. This individual has appeared before the courts in connection with various activities. Last year he was before the courts having been arrested for driving while disqualified. The judge asked him why he was driving, to which he replied that he was in fear of his life, and he was allowed to walk free from the court and is driving to this day. The man in question is Seán Buckley. The Minister can ask the gardaí at Sundrive Garda Station whether they have a file on him and whether they will take action against him, given that there has been a number of complaints against him from residents and others throughout the three years I have been dealing with cases relating to him, and that they have named individual gardaí who have dealt with him and protected him when he breached barring orders and the like.How many other police informers are protected in this way and allowed to carry on with their crime spree and attacks on communities? The victims of those individuals have no recourse, having lost faith in the Garda Síochána. Because the Garda Síochána protects these individuals, the victims cannot go to the Garda Complaints Board. Therefore, there is a crying need for an ombudsman and I agree with the Minister that we should accelerate this Bill as quickly as possible without interfering with parliamentary procedure, and that we should have the time to debate the new amendments he has put down.There is consensus on the model I have put forward of a singular Garda ombudsman. The Commission on Human Rights, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the spokespersons of the parties who have spoken are all agreed on that. I could quote from various scripts I have, but in the interests of time I will not go down that road. It will suffice to refer the Minister again to the ICCL submission which states the best model of an independent complaints mechanism is that of an independent ombudsman based on the Hayes review. Professor Dermot Walsh, who did a critique of the Minister's proposals, was of the same opinion. Amnesty International made a major statement in its document, Human Rights Begin at Home, when making recommendations in the context of the Irish EU Presidency last year.My party made a submission at the request of the Minister on policy on Garda reform before the Bill was put together. We took much of what other people had to say and added to it. At that stage we recommended an independent Garda ombudsman to investigate police misconduct. It was to be a merit-based appointment with selection on the basis of published criteria, and it was to be adequately resourced and staffed. On Committee Stage, the Minister suggested the staffing of the Ombudsman Commission would be half that which the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms Nuala O'Loan, enjoys, despite the fact that we have two and a half times the population of Northern Ireland and, it appears, double or treble the amount of skullduggery in the Garda in comparison to the RUC. We said it should be granted the necessary legal powers and resources to conduct independent investigations and allowed a scope of investigation that includes the special detective unit. The necessity for that is borne out if one looks at the Morris reports. It should be authorised to question witnesses, compel document disclosure and access locations at will, and granted the same legal powers as the Garda to arrest and hold criminal suspects related to its investigations. It should be empowered to determine breaches of Garda disciplinary codes and to refer evidence of criminality to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It should be empowered to resolve appropriate complaints informally with the complainant's consent. It should be empowered to resolve complaints formally by assigning penalties and remedies, including a recommendation for disciplinary action, dismissal, changes in policy or procedure or compensation to the complainant. It should be empowered to investigate systematic problems, including policies and practices, and to make general recommendations to eliminate causes of classes of complaints where determined necessary by the ombudsman. In line with that, the Garda Síochána human rights audit, which was carried out by Ionann Management Consultants in June of last year, suggested in relation to the ethnic and national origin of complainants that the ombudsman may also consider conducting thematic investigations into the handling of complaints of race and other hate crimes. The ethnic and national origins of complainants, their ages and sex should be monitored with the nature of complaints and their origin to establish if patterns or trends emerge.Sinn Féin, in its document on Garda reform, calls for the Garda ombudsman to be:—empowered to conduct independent investigations on matters of public interest on his or her own volition, or on the request of the Minister, without the need for a complainant. . . . [that is the point I made earlier] . . . . and this would be compulsory in the case of certain violations involving loss of life, excessive force, ill-treatment in custody, discrimination and political interference;—Granted retrospective investigative powers;—Required to produce an Annual Report for publication, including statistics, identified trends or patterns, analyses and recommendations;—Provided with a mechanism for effective interaction, sharing of information, and collaborative investigation that enables the Garda Ombudsman and the Police Ombudsman for the Six Counties to work together.That is what Sinn Féin had to say on this issue in December 2003 and early 2004. Thankfully many of those powers are contained in the Bill. My amendment No. 189 and amendment No. 180 in the name of Deputy Cuffe seek to transcribe the full Patten model into the legislation. There is consensus on the ombudsman being a singular person.The word "ombudsman" as gaeilge, even though it appears in the parliamentary dictionary as "ombudsman" is "fear an pobal" or "bean an pobal". That translation, as used in the past, has proper meaning. It means a man of the people or a woman of the people who represents the best interests of the public. Such a person is independent and puts the best interests of the public first. I believe that task can be served best by one person rather than the trio, as suggested by the Minister, who can agree or disagree. That proposal could cause problems in the future.

I draw the attention of Members opposite to their duty, before they make an allegation of dishonesty or impugn the integrity of a Minister, to be fair in the manner in which they carry out their parliamentary functions. I have a copy of the full text of the response of the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the Priority Question from former Deputy Alan Shatter. The record speaks for itself. I will not read it all but will read a passage which I believe the House should hear. It states:I have already advised the House that a file on this matter, following Assistant Commissioner Carty's investigation, has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Following receipt of directions from the DPP, one person not a member of an Garda Síochána, has been arrested and charged. Further directions are awaited in respect of other aspects of the investigation. A number of civil actions relating to the case are outstanding.The Garda Commissioner has already taken action to restore confidence. The Deputy will be aware that when the commissioner received the report of the assistant commissioner on the allegations in question, he decided in the best interests of the public and the Garda Síochána to transfer a number of personnel.Additional informationI have also recently been informed by the Garda authorities that an inquiry under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, has been initiated by the Garda Commissioner with a view to investigating suspected breaches of discipline by a number of members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal division arising from the investigation conducted by Assistant Commissioner Carty.The Deputy asks if I intend to publish the reports of the earlier investigations into the allegations of Garda misconduct in the Donegal area and, in this regard, if I have received the completed reports from the Garda Commissioner. On the latter point, the Deputy will be aware from recent correspondence that I have not seen the investigation file nor would it be normal practice for the Minister to do so. I have, of course, as I have previously informed the House, received a report of the assistant commissioner's investigation from the Garda Commissioner.That is what he said. He then went on to say:Given the various investigations and proceedings ongoing in relation to this matter, I do not believe it would be appropriate at this time to publish any of the reports that I have received in the matter nor to lodge them in the Oireachtas Library.My primary concern is to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the truth of what happened in Donegal is established and becomes known to the public. . . .I will repeat that.My primary concern is to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the truth of what happened in Donegal is established and becomes known to the public and while also ensuring that this is done in such a way that no proceedings are jeopardised so that justice can be done and be seen to be done.That is what he said. He went on to say, in reply to Deputy Shatter: "As I have indicated on a number of occasions I am anxious that we get to the bottom of what happened in Donegal." The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, then made the following remarks as outlined by Deputy Howlin: "The investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the DPP."

In page 11, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:4.—Every order or regulation made by the Minister pursuant to this Act shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and, if a resolution annulling the regulation or order is passed within the next twenty one days after the House has sat following such laying, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.".The purpose of this amendment is to adopt the standard procedures for accountability, namely, that every order made under the regulations by the Minister pursuant to this Act would be laid before the House. There is currently no provision for this, and I am proposing the amendment because of the huge number of issues to be dealt with by regulation. In many ways this is enabling legislation and subject to an enormous number of regulations in terms of its implementation.I spoke to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe a minute ago about the whistleblowers' charter which consists of some ten lines in terms of the Minister's amendment. However, its actual implementation will be subject to regulations to be drawn up. It is proposed, with regard to that matter, that the regulations will be put before the House, but how many other sections will not be put before the House? One of the Minister's most recent amendments, amendment No. 13, refers to the 1989 regulations. We also dealt with discipline regulations under sections 115 and 119. This legislation is peppered with provisions for regulations to be drawn up by the Commissioner and the Minister, but they will not be made available to the House in all cases. When enacted, this will be very large legislation considering all of the amendments put forward. However, it will be much larger if one adds up the number of regulatory provisions that will be grafted on in terms of rolling out this legislation.The Minister has already appointed Senator Maurice Hayes to be responsible for oversight of the rolling out of this legislation. To what extent will he be involved with the Minister and the Department in drawing up the regulations? Does the Minister intend to involve the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in this matter because of the plethora of necessary regulations?I insist in this amendment that the Minister at least has the courtesy and proper procedure to make sure the regulations are laid before the House so that there is an opportunity to examine, object to and seek to amend them.We have already had major controversy on some of these issues. The Garda organisations are quite put out by the manner in which the Minister has presented some of the amendments. We will not have the opportunity to go into any detail in the discussions or to properly scrutinise any of the substantial amendments. The Minister confused everybody by not including them in the two main books presented to us, even though he gave the impression that all the amendments were included. The Minister then surreptitiously turned up with his own white paper, presenting these substantial amendments which will not be the subject of any proper debate. As a result, my amendment is all the more important because of so many key and sensitive issues regarding the organisation and discipline of the Garda, issues which can result in a great deal of harm if not dealt with properly.As the Minister knows, the next time he goes to conciliation with the Garda, he will hear loudly enough what the force has to say about his amendments today in terms of how he has treated the Garda with regard to consultation or lack thereof, or any attempt to enter into a form of conciliation on some of the matters which provide for summary dismissal.The Minister must think about families, terms of employment and so on and cannot simply barge in like a bull in a china shop. The manner in which the Minister is bringing forward some of the amendments regarding accountability will undermine the good work of a lot of this legislation because it threatens the morale of the Garda. Unless the Garda is brought along with us on this legislation in a fair way in terms of due process, we are building up trouble in the foreseeable future.It is important that every item of regulation and every provision that comes under the precept of this Bill be presented to this House so that the Members can have an opportunity to see it and object to any undesirable aspects, considering that the Minister has refused to give us adequate time to explore and scrutinise his amendments, tabled as usual at the last minute without due consideration for the proper legislative procedures of this House.

It goes to the heart of the involvement of the Oireachtas in issues of primary and secondary legislation.Having called to the General Office just half an hour ago to seek the complete up-to-date list of all the amendments on Report Stage of the Bill, I was appalled that the only document the office could give me was the one which was available yesterday and which was not the full list. I was trying to trace the amendment relating to the whistleblowers' charter and could not find it in the green paper version. My colleague, Deputy Costello, then informed me that two or three more sheets of amendments had since been circulated, and that I would have to go through them. This is quite ridiculous.

Arising out of what Deputy Costello said, this House has a genuine function in the preservation and development of our democracy.

Deputy Costello proposes that all regulations would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that it would have an adequate length of time to deal with those. In some ways I would go further because there are different ways of dealing with secondary legislation. I fully endorse Deputy Costello's proposal in so far as it goes, but there are some regulations where we should go even further and insist on an affirmative vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas before the regulation would come into effect. Otherwise there is a danger that we will have the process of having orders and regulations merely mentioned at the back of the Order Paper each day, having been laid before the Oireachtas Library, and never even noticed.It is a start of the counter-attack to get the Oireachtas into the centre of the stage as far primary and secondary legislation are concerned. From that point of view I heartily endorse Deputy Costello's amendment.

Others are of a broader nature. The Bill differentiates in various sections between regulations which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and ones which do not have to be. That is how the Garda Síochána has always been run. Some regulations must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas while others need not be. It does not make sense to say that every regulation in either the Army or the Garda Síochána should have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In some cases we must be practical about such matters.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe should also take on board that with the great raft of secondary legislation for which this House already has responsibility, the degree of scrutiny is far less than it might be. That applies to all sides of this House.

We do not have scrutiny arrangements in this House which are appropriate or adequate to the task. The Parliament in the United Kingdom has secondary legislation scrutiny which is much more active and vigilant than that managed by this House at any time in the past.Members of this House can see every regulation made merely by asking to see it.

If, for example, Garda uniforms are provided for in regulation, is the size of the harp on the jacket button to be the subject of a statutory instrument? Is that what the Opposition wants? I do not think so. On the other hand, it has to be the subject of some form of regulation. Under the existing law, some forms of regulation are put before the Houses, and will be under this law, whereas others are not. A blanket approach of the kind suggested by Deputy Costello's amendment is cumbersome. It is delusional that if that were the case, it would increase the democratic accountability of the way in which the Garda is run. I doubt it would, and it would add to the unread pile of paper in the Oireachtas Library.I do not wish to digress in a disorderly fashion but the Deputy has consistently suggested I am responsible for the order in which the amendments have been tabled. My Department submitted all its amendments by 7.30 p.m. last Monday while Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendments were submitted the following day. I have no control whatsoever over whether the amendments appear on green or white sheets or in what order they are tabled. That is a matter for the Bills Office and I have no input whatsoever in this regard. All I did was deliver the amendments by a specified deadline, which was extended to 7.30 p.m. last Monday, and I have not submitted a line to that office since. Deputy Ó Snodaigh was treated somewhat more generously and he was permitted to table his amendments——

It is absolutely unfair to put it under the pressure the Minister has applied this week. It is part of the unseemly rush to get the Bill on to the Statute Book without appropriate deliberation.With regard to the amendment, for once I agree with the Minister that there is inadequate scrutiny by the House of secondary legislation and we should consider better ways to achieve that. The only progress in this regard has been made by the scrutiny sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, which is effective. I made a proposal to the Minister, with which I understood he was in agreement, that an Oireachtas security committee should be established. If such a committee were established, secondary legislation in this area could be scrutinised.I am glad the Minister agrees with the proposal but I sought its implementation. It must be set up by the House but that will involve the Minister making a proposal to set it up or bringing a memorandum to Government. Even though we may agree on the proposal, it will not happen unless the Government causes it to happen. I would be glad if the Minister would confirm he is making arrangements accordingly.

He also tabled amendment No. 94 to amend amendment No. 94a.I support the amendment. Onerous duties and responsibilities will be proffered on the Garda and there should be proper democratic scrutiny. The orders and regulations relating to our police force should be laid before the House and a mechanism needs to be found to examine them. For example, a reserve force will be established at some stage in the future and the regulations pertaining to its establishment need to be fully scrutinised to ensure the issues I raised about it yesterday are addressed. The public and the Legislature should understand fully how the reserve force will operate, who will be in charge and the uniform, hours, pay and training that will be involved, as it is not clear in the legislation. These issues must be scrutinised, not to delay the implementation of the force but to ensure the best police service is provided in our communities.

The Bill differentiates between the two and provides, in some cases, that there will be parliamentary scrutiny and, in others, that there will not. That is a practical and reasonable way to approach this issue. It is not something about which the House must be informed every time there is a minute change in the internal regulation of the Garda.I wish to be associated with the Ceann Comhairle's remarks about the Bills Office. It works extremely hard to serve the House and at times we impose difficult workloads on that office. I am conscious of that but I have no control over the order in which pieces of paper come to this House, no more than Deputy Ó Snodaigh had control over the sheet of paper on which his material appeared. These matters are decided by the House through the Bills Office, not by me.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	611	We all pay tribute to the Bills Office but we should ensure that it is not put under such pressure by giving it intolerable deadlines. The people responsible for that should be departmental officials. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will examine this matter and discuss it with the Bills Office. It is unsatisfactory.The main reason given by the Minister for rejecting the amendment is that every regulation that is made cannot be laid before the House. Members can see the regulations on demand. The Minister mentioned that the regulation could be about the size of the buttons or the brass for the uniform of an officer. However, I am not referring to the regulations made by the Commissioner but to those made by the Minister. The amendment refers to "every order or regulation made by the Minister". An order made by the Minister would not deal with the daily operation of the Garda or the design of the uniform but would refer to important matters.I have in mind Part 6 of the legislation which deals with regulations and miscellaneous provisions. A raft of disciplinary and organisational matters are subject to the provisions in Part 6. The Minister will be responsible for drafting and approving those regulations, with the approval of the Government. Section 115 covers many matters of extreme concern to members with regard to rank, pay, allowances, training, use of facilities, penalties and the retirement of members. Volunteer members are governed by the disciplinary regulations as well. Part 6 deals with many serious matters relating to the code of conduct and the organisation and discipline of the Garda Síochána.I do not understand why the Minister should object to regulations on these matters being put before the House or into the Oireachtas Library. We will not have a debate on them but we will have the opportunity to peruse them and, if appropriate, object to them within 21 days. It is standard practice. It would not be difficult for the Minister to do that. If the regulations or orders must be drafted and printed and put in somebody's cupboard somewhere, why can they not be laid before the House? I do not understand why we cannot adopt a standard way of dealing with regulations drawn up by a Minister. They can be annulled, if necessary, after 21 days but they should be laid before the House for scrutiny.Suggesting that we are dealing with buttons and brass is not helpful. We are dealing with the implementation of this legislation and the important issues that will be dealt with by regulation. These are the issues that will determine whether this legislation is effective. Much of the work will be done under the oversight of Senator Maurice Hayes. The Minister will work on it too. Obviously, if the justice committee could assist, it would. However, what is not required is that regulations be drawn up in secret. If the Minister states that certain regulations should not be in the public domain, so be it. He can put his case and establish the caveat that matters that deal with the security of the State will be withheld from public scrutiny.However, that is not the same as refusing to put disciplinary and organisational regulations before the House for the scrutiny of Members. That is particularly so when the Minister has refused us the opportunity to have a full and thorough debate on the provisions of this legislation. The fact that we did not have the opportunity to have that debate means we will be reliant on the roll-out of this legislation by regulation. The secondary legislation will be as important as the primary legislation in that respect but the Minister does not intend to give us the opportunity to examine either. We have seen these enabling provisions but the Minister will deny us the opportunity to see what they will enable the authorities and the agents of the State to do or how they propose to deal with the organisation, work and discipline of the Garda. We are entitled to see that.The Minister says he will let us see some of the regulations and refuse to let us see others. He then gave the most menial example imaginable. That is no way to conduct business and it is not an acceptable explanation. The Minister must accept this standard form of accountability. It is, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, a low threshold of accountability. It is not a proactive threshold whereby the regulations could be put on the Order Paper for debate or referral to a committee. It merely provides that they will be placed in the Oireachtas Library and that Members will be made aware of them and will have 21 days to exercise their option of responding to them. The Minister considers this too much work, involving too much paper. It is too much of a problem. In reality, however, no extra work or paper is involved and it would cause no greater difficulty. It would provide a level of oversight by the House that would not otherwise exist.It is not a major task to make these regulations available to the House. I do not know if the Minister thinks he is concealing something or if he wishes to put everything under the broad brush of security but it is not good enough. Certain matters come within the ambit of security but, by and large, they are few and far between. They do not involve many regulations. The Minister could accept this amendment and thereby establish a precedent for every order or regulation made not just by this Minister but also by other Ministers, pursuant to the legislation in place. If they are important enough to be included in the legislation, they should be sufficiently important to be laid before the House in some format so Members can exercise oversight of them. Perhaps the Minister will change his mind and save us putting this issue to a vote by accepting this amendment, which has the support of all parties on this side of the House.

Chuirfí a lán de na cúraim seo air.Tagaim anois chuig an chuid lárnach den méid atá le rá agam. Casfaidh mé ar an Bhéarla, mar is as Béarla atá an tuairisc seo a luaigh mé. In the amendment I seek — I do not know if the Minister is seeking it yet —to protect and promote human rights. Last year, a Garda Síochána human rights audit was carried out by Ionann Management Consultants Limited. This English-based company produced a report which, although only 22 pages long, is detailed in terms of the significant scope of its remit. Its findings go to the core of what I seek in these amendments. The report observed that the Garda had launched a human rights initiative in 1999, five years prior to the audit, established a Garda human rights office and, in 2003, published a declaration of professional values and ethical standards. Despite these developments, the report concluded that human rights are not yet embedded in or intrinsic to the culture and ethos of An Garda Síochána.This is an extremely serious conclusion, particularly in view of the findings of the Morris tribunals and the potential findings of the next eight modules over which Mr. Justice Morris will preside. It seems that initiatives and efforts to date have made no impact in reinforcing the human rights ethos that should prevail in An Garda Síochána. The independent audit found, for example, that there was a long delay in issuing the declaration even though it was supposed to come soon after the initiative was launched in 1999.The audit report also found that the declaration was not reinforced through training and promotion of the human rights message. It was discovered that few members were aware of the contents of the declaration one year after its inception. Moreover, it was found that members who were aware of it did not understand its implications for their work practices. The consultants observed that the declaration itself was vaguely worded and that there was no management direction on how to incorporate the declaration into the daily work of gardaí.The audit report also found that the existing Garda code does not reflect and embed human rights practice and that there is no mechanism in place to allow for systematic and routine monitoring of the use of police powers in regard to human rights issues. It found that most gardaí still consider human rights as a back-covering exercise. This situation demands decisive action and legislative prescription. I support the human rights auditors' recommendation for an urgent and thorough review of all Garda policies and operational procedures for human rights compliance.This is the background to my request that a greater priority and a specific objective be given to An Garda Síochána to protect and promote human rights. One example in this regard is the issue of domestic violence, an issue with which many members of An Garda Síochána must deal and in respect of which some positive steps have been taken. Earlier this year, the chairwoman of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Ms Gráinne Healy, called on the Garda to re-prioritise domestic violence.It is almost ten years since this issue was listed as a priority in the annual policing plan. Domestic violence, which affects a significant number of women, a small number of men and many children, is an issue of human rights. If the Garda is not willing to prioritise domestic violence in its annual policing plan, the issue should at the very least form part of the force's service objective by the express inclusion of human rights at the core of the functions of An Garda Síochána.My party's submission to the Minister on Garda reform included a section dealing with the need for An Garda Síochána to have the human rights ethos at its core. From this would flow a proper policing service of which we could all be proud and which communities could work with, embrace and enhance as time goes on. Policing can and should make a positive contribution to the protection and promotion of human rights. Best practice on human rights in policing requires not only human rights training and periodic upskilling but also a pervasive human rights ethos underpinned by a specific code of conduct in line with international standards and reflecting a human rights-based philosophy of policing.We have an opportunity for Garda reform. However, we have not ensured that the police service will be fully compliant with the relevant international instruments on policing standards as well as the UN and EU best practice guidelines on codes of conduct. We welcome the steps that have been taken since 1999 but we recommend that the human rights ethos should become a core value.Amendment No. 20 is self-explanatory. Rather than sometimes working against the interests of communities, An Garda Síochána should work to protect the security of communities and should provide positive leadership. In my own area of Ballyfermot I am a member of the drugs task force, the Cherry Orchard regeneration forum and the Cherry Orchard development council. Members of An Garda Síochána play a valuable role on those bodies through their attendance and contribution. This participation means gardaí are beginning to look at the community in a more holistic fashion and to recognise that their role is not only to protect the security of the community but also, through their attendance at these vital democratic community fora, to assist in providing a positive communal leadership.One hopes this example is mirrored throughout the country and gardaí are to be commended on their work in this regard. It may be frustrating for gardaí to spend hours attending residents' association meetings and other community fora. However, the time they invest at those meetings is time well invested and both the community and An Garda Síochána will benefit in the long term. I participated in a residents association meeting in Chapelizod some days ago which was attended by local gardaí——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The fifth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission on the continuing activities of paramilitary groups, submitted pursuant to Articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement establishing the IMC, was published last month. This report, as with previous reports, sets out, inter alia, an assessment of the current activities of paramilitary groups and details incidents of violence and exiling. Although most of the activities reported refer specifically to Northern Ireland, some do not and the general assessment of each group’s status is broadly as valid to the south as to the north of the Border.In the case of the Real IRA, the IMC states that it is the most active of the dissident republican groups and remains engaged in acts of terrorism and organised crime. The IMC goes on to state that RIRA has recruited and trained members in the use of firearms and has continued to improve its capacity in the use of explosives. The IMC believes this is the work of an organisation which is ruthless and committed to terrorism. I am pleased to note that the Special Criminal Court last week sentenced five members of RIRA to imprisonment on conviction for membership of an unlawful organisation. One of these members was described as the officer commanding of RIRA in Munster, with three of the others described as constituting an active service unit.In respect of the Continuity IRA, the IMC states that it has continued to be sporadically active. CIRA has undertaken some re-organisation, particularly in its command structure, which the IMC believes may indicate an intention to increase its level of activity. CIRA continues to take on new members and to train, including in the use of rifles and explosives, and it is making efforts to improve its engineering capacity, particularly with regard to explosives, and its access to weapons. Two members of CIRA were arrested in this jurisdiction in January 2005 for possession of an under-car explosive device. The IMC goes on to state that CIRA has no interest in a ceasefire and believes that it plans to continue to engage in terrorism and other crimes, possibly more than in the recent past.In the case of the INLA, the IMC states that its members remain very actively involved in organised crime, including drugs, although its level of activity is not as high as in previous reporting periods. The IMC adds that the threat of the organisation's more active engagement remains.The IMC states that the Provisional IRA continues to maintain its medium term effectiveness. It continues to recruit and train new members, including in the use of firearms and explosives, and continues to gather intelligence. The IMC goes on to state that PIRA remains engaged in organised crime, including, for example, the smuggling of fuel and tobacco. Moreover, recent events have shown PIRA's sophisticated use of money laundering as a means of securing in the long term the proceeds of serious crime, such as the Northern Bank raid. The IMC concludes by noting that PIRA remains a highly active organisation which is at present determined to maintain its effectiveness in terms of organised crime and the potential for terrorism.The Garda authorities assure me that the Garda Síochána has sufficient resources to deal with the terrorist and criminal activities of paramilitary groups. As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Síochána has never been better resourced. For example, the Government has increased the Garda budget by more than 90%, from €599 million in 1997 to €1.39 billion in 2005——

I am aware of the IMC report. Is the level of activity of paramilitaries increasing, being maintained or decreasing? That is what I am after.I would also like some indication of whether he has any idea of the numbers involved in such activity. Will he inform the House on whether the recent upsurge in crime and armed robberies has any connection with freelance or redundant republicans, in terms of personnel or the provision of arms for such robberies?I am genuinely on an information seeking mission. I want to know whether we are seeing a decline or an increase in the level of activity or if there has been no change. That is the point of my question.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	629	There are reasons to believe the Provos are engaged in a process of consultation on how the entire movement, that is, the IRA and Sinn Féin, will address the new situation created by the political circumstances obtaining in Northern Ireland, the fact that they were discovered to be the masterminds and perpetrators of the Northern Bank robbery and the money laundering in the South and the involvement of their members in the murder of Robert McCartney. I believe those consultations are at an advanced stage and it is now a matter for the leadership of the Provisional movement to decide when they will announce an end to paramilitary activity, criminality, violence, the threat of violence and their reign of terror in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland.In terms of the other groups, Deputy O'Keeffe will be aware that they continue to attempt to get their act together. The Garda continues to have considerable success in breaking up their efforts and detecting their activities. With regard to freelance activities, there is some sporadic evidence that former paramilitaries are now turning to ordinary criminality as a lifestyle maintenance activity outside their paramilitary connections. Recently, a number of incidents have taken place in which these kinds of people, apparently acting for personal gain, have become involved.

The Minister seems to hope the Provisional IRA and its leadership at political and paramilitary level may arrive at a conclusion which will end all paramilitary and criminal activity. Could the Minister give an indication as to what sort of timeframe he hopes for or expects in that regard?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	631	It is difficult to be precise on numbers because, if we knew the exact figures, many of our problems would be solved. It is fair to say that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 active volunteers in the IRA. None of the dissident groups would have many more than 150 people attached to them.In terms of timeframes for this, obviously, the sooner these decisions are made the better. However, they have to be made in a credible way and be accompanied by acts. The Taoiseach made it clear to the Provisional movement that words alone will not suffice. They have to be accompanied by acts and inaction of a palpable kind which will convince, not only the members of those movements, but the community at large and, in particular, the community which has most to fear from them that it is well and truly over.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January 2004 to 13 June 2004, six murders were recorded as being committed using a firearm. In the period from 1 January to 22 June 2005, nine murders were recorded as being committed using a firearm.While I have repeatedly urged caution in the interpretation of statistics, particularly statistics covering comparatively short periods of time, it is worth noting that, of the nine murders involving firearms this year, one occurred in March, five in April, three in May and none in June to date. With one exception, the murders were committed in the Dublin area. I am satisfied that Operation Anvil is making a significant contribution to securing a reduction in this type of offence. I commend the Commissioner and the members of An Garda Síochána for the efficient and effective use of the resources made available to them.Operation Anvil was initiated by the Garda Commissioner on 16 May. I provided details in respect of it to the House on 17 May. Its main focus is targeting active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting criminal activity. It involves overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols. In addition, intelligence led covert operations are undertaken, as are searches and continued gathering and collation of high quality criminal intelligence.I am informed by the Garda authorities that, since its inception, there have been 377 arrests and 76 firearms recovered. It is not possible to provide details pertaining to the number of charges preferred as a number of investigations, in respect of which investigation files will be submitted to the law officers for direction in due course, are ongoing.As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is on Second Stage in the House, provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures that will enhance the capacity of the Garda to investigate and prosecute offences. In that context, I will bring forward, on Committee Stage, a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearm offences, including a mandatory minimum sentence in some cases. I will also introduce a new offence of illegally making a sawn-off shotgun.I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend, for obvious reasons, to have lower conviction rates than other murders. This is not unique to Ireland; it is a pattern across the world. However, the number of violent deaths, both murder and manslaughter, recorded in 2004 was 45, the lowest number in ten years, despite the fact our population increased by 400,000 during that ten-year period.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Does the Minister agree that there have already been as many if not more deaths as a result of gangland killings in the first half of this year as occurred in nine of the past ten years? Does he consider that even with Operation Crossover, which was established in November 2004 and which lasted a few months, the situation for the first six months of this year is worse than that which obtained in any other year? It seems that once the blip of intensified Garda activity ended, the situation not only reverted to its previous state but appeared to get worse. Does the Minister agree that the €6.5 million being spent on Operation Anvil will end up having the same effect as the €4 million on Operation Crossover? Paying overtime is not the way to deal with gangland activity. What is required is a concerted plan, involving year-round effort, in order to achieve results.Does the Minister agree that gangland killings are effectively the worst type of crime and attract the lowest detection rate? A hitman is almost assured that the last thing that will happen is that he will be detected, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned. Until such time as the Minister puts forward specific proposals to deal with the problem, the situation can only become worse.

Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world. If one examines the figures I gave, the number of people who died last year as a result of homicides — involving either manslaughter and murder — was 45. That is one of the lowest figures in ten years, despite the fact that the population increased dramatically in that time. We must be clear on that.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I share the Deputy's point of view on firearms to some extent but the figures to which he referred are not quite right. In 1998, for example, four murders involving firearms took place. That increased to 12 in 1999, stayed at 12 in 2000, decreased to nine in 2001, increased to ten in 2002, increased to 20 in 2003 and decreased to nine last year. This year the figure has already reached nine. It is not true to say that the situation has never been as bad as it is at present. There were four detections in respect of the ten murders committed in 2002, ten of the 20 murders in 2003 resulted in detections and in respect of the nine murders in 2004 there were six detections. It is not as black a picture in terms of detection as the Deputy suggests.

That is what Operation Anvil is all about. The Deputy asked if we should have bursts of activity such as that surrounding Operation Anvil or if we should we adopt a constant approach. I discussed this matter with the Garda Commissioner. His view is that special operations have merit. It is similar to playing a football match. One must say to the team at some stage that the next five minutes is crucial and that points must be scored. One cannot simply state that overtime has nothing to do with it. It does have something to do with it.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	653	As the Deputy is aware, over the years numerous organisations have requested and have been given the assistance of gardaí on a non-public duty basis. This non-public duty is performed by members of An Garda Síochána under arrangements made by the Garda authorities with organisers of events such as football matches, race meetings and rock concerts who seek their services to perform duties to which they would not normally be assigned. Traditionally, members of the force have been made available for the performance of such duties and the State has charged for their services. The work is done by members who would otherwise be off duty.At present, the organisers of events who request the services of gardaí on a non-public duty basis are made aware of the conditions attached to this arrangement by the relevant district officers and pay for the cost of non-public duties performed by gardaí inside the event location, such as, for example, at sporting events, major GAA or soccer matches and rock concerts. Gardaí who operate inside the venue are paid, while those on duty outside are supplied without payment.The cost of policing duties performed by gardaí outside such as traffic control, beat patrols etc., are not paid for by the organisers of events and fall to be paid from public funds. The Garda authorities point out that it is difficult to distinguish where public duty ends and private policing starts on these occasions. Section 26 of the Garda Síochána Bill, which is before the House at present, provides a new statutory basis for the Garda Commissioner to charge for police services for commercial events such as sports fixtures, concerts etc. Regulations may also be made under the Bill governing this new power and, in particular, the costs which are to be taken into account by the Commissioner. That matter will be dealt with by regulation but it is my intention that those who run for profit events in particular, should pay a very considerable portion of the policing costs occasioned by their events inside and outside the venue. A graduated approach will have to be taken to this issue because it would be wrong to start charging the organisers of not for profit events, such as the community games, for policing. We also have to consider places like Lansdowne Road and Croke Park, GAA matches and the like. I want a system that is fair to the taxpayer. The people who charge big money for the tickets for these events should factor into the price a reasonable portion of the cost to the community of running the event. They cannot simply take the profit and leave the community to pay the bills.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I welcome the Minister's reply in so far as I understand that he intends to change what has been the position until now. My question relates to events that generate very large profits. I am referring to police activities outside the events that, until now, the event organiser gets free gratis. In other words, the taxpayer subsidises them.I mention Croke Park because I know it best; it is in my area. On non-match days one would be lucky to see a garda anywhere in the environs of Croke Park yet on match days the gardaí rightly operate a cordon on streets around the stadium. They patrol the area in vans, on motorcycles and with dogs, mounted units, tow trucks and all the other paraphernalia. It all descends on the place to facilitate Croke Park but it equally facilitates public safety. Incidentally, Croke Park made €2 million profit on tickets last year.

They cannot extend the cordon to areas within a reasonable distance, such as Iona Road, which is across the Drumcondra Road from Croke Park. Not only does the event organiser not pay——

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	658	——for the police activities outside the event, areas around the cordoned area cannot be properly policed. If the event organisers were paying their fair share, instead of the taxpayers subsidising huge profits, perhaps the Garda could put in the resources and ensure public safety in respect of everyone but particularly the people who live in those areas.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I agree with Deputy Gregory that if event organisers, particularly those who organise high profit events, were obliged to pay their fair share of the extra security and policing costs the event creates, there would be more resources and it would be easier for local district officers to assign gardaí to deal with the problems to which the Deputy refers. For instance, we all see people on occasion drinking outside pubs throughout the city. Although it is technically illegal in nearly every case, it is something one might think the gardaí in many cases correctly decide is not worth taking names and address for, but they should warn the publicans that they are breaching the law by allowing drink to be served on the street outside the premises. Urinating in public places is one of the offences for which I hope to bring in a fixed penalty notice system because gardaí should not have to go to the District Court three months later to try to identify the lamp-post against which the urination in question took place.

In Lansdowne Road, for instance, in my constituency, one aspect on which the residents have a very strong view, especially in the context of its redevelopment, is that there would be a comprehensive traffic management plan which would come into effect under special by-laws that would decide who is allowed park and all those issues rather than find themselves in a community under siege, which the Deputy would echo in terms of the environs of Croke Park, on these occasions. It is very difficult for people who live near a stadium to have to put up with behaviour of that kind on a regular basis. I agree with the Deputy that the more money that is made available by the event organisers to the Garda to police those events, both inside and outside but particularly outside, the happier the community will be.

As in the case of other Bills, in the course of formal drafting I will take account of the comments I receive on publication of the draft heads.I confirm, as indicated in response to questions in the House on a number of occasions, that the Bill will contain provisions in regard to a press council, a press ombudsman and a press code of standards.The Legal Advisory Group on Defamation Report in 2003 suggested a particular model involving a State appointed press council. That model did not attract me. The approach I favour is statutory recognition by way of a resolution to be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas, of an independent organisation which would request to be recognised as the press council of Ireland for the purposes of the legislation. Recognition would bring certain privileges such as immunity from action in respect of its decisions, judgments and directions. I also envisage that such a press council would have, as its central focus, a code of standards supported by and subscribed to by print media organisations with operations in the State. Such a code of standards would provide an additional protection for citizens' privacy from media intrusion and harassment. It is also envisaged that the press ombudsman would be established by the press council to deal with complaints from those affected by breaches of the code of standards. One of the major issues in regard to a press council is the question of who will select the independent members and whether they will be genuinely independent because it cannot be a poodle of the media, no more than it can be a poodle of the Government.The focus of efforts before and during my time as Minister has been on reform in the area of defamation but in the meantime there have been notable developments of jurisprudence in the area of privacy in the European Court of Human Rights, in English courts and in our own courts. There is a view that the developing jurisprudence in this area, as well as the capacity of our courts to develop the principles of law on a case by case basis, could have been sufficient to protect the privacy of persons. However, the Government's considered view is that the area is worthy of study with a view to seeking an appropriate legislative basis for the protection of privacy which would be consistent with freedom of expression. I am in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to progressing that matter. The details of any proposals for legislation on the privacy area will be announced in due course following the Attorney General and myself working on the issue and bringing the matter to Government.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	667	I get a distinct sense that there is not a united approach on the part of the Government on this issue. In fact, I suspect that reform of the libel laws will fall within the cracks in the coalition and the Minister's reply does not allay that suspicion.I want to focus on a number of issues. First, do I take it from the Minister's reply that he does not consider legislation to be necessary in the privacy area because of developments in jurisprudence both here and in Europe? Second, on reform of the libel laws, is there a direct connection with some decisions in the privacy area or will we have action soon? I say that because I always understood the Minister was very interested in this area. He produced a Private Members' Bill about eight or nine years ago. We have consultations, advisory groups, major conferences and God knows what else, yet nothing seems to be happening. Will the Minister indicate a timeframe? When will we have a Bill on reform of the libel laws? I want reform in that area and, while I do not want the statutory press council promised in An Agreed Programme for Government, I want a voluntary press council.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	668	It all depends on what one means by the term "statutory". A purely voluntary body would be wholly ineffectual because its judgments, decisions and so on would be subject to being sued. In other words, it would not have any teeth. By the same token, a statutory press council of the other kind, in which the State, through the Government, decided what a press council would be and who would serve on it, is also unattractive. There is a middle way, namely, recognition of an independent voluntary body which comes up to certain criteria of independence and effectiveness, and the creation of statutory consequences for such a body once its comes into existence. That is the model on which I have been working and which will be in the proposals to be published by Government.With regard to privacy, rather than see it as a major split between the Government parties or between me and members of the Government, it is more constructive to see this as one on which——

One of them is that privacy is a very complicated issue. For example, at one level, one could claim the intrusion into Leas Cross nursing home was a breach of patient privacy whereas at another level, it could be claimed it was in the public interest that the information should be published.How, in a statute, to work out the exact line of demarcation between what is acceptable and what is not is a matter that will undoubtedly cause difficulty. However, by the same token, the programme for Government intends, in the context of a statutory protection of privacy, that defamation reform will proceed. The Attorney General and I will be able to put together a privacy law that will not be overly prescriptive but will make it clear that breach of privacy which is not lawful or constitutional by other considerations should be actionable.This is necessary because many current cases lead people to wonder exactly where the law of privacy does and does not run. There has been English jurisprudence concerning supermodels being photographed in gyms and so on and a case involving Princess Caroline of Monaco and the German press, which hounded her and published photographs of her day-to-day existence.

The Government's point of view is that we should not shy away from the issue just because it is difficult if we can come up with a law which is a help and protects privacy. The Attorney General and I will work on that in the next few months.The Deputy asked for an indicative timeframe for this. I hope that by early autumn — in September or October — I will be in a position to publish the heads of the defamation Bill, which will then be at a fairly advanced stage of drafting, and, with the Attorney General, to bring to Government proposals for a privacy law.

I am not in favour of a statutory press council but of an independent press council. However, on that point, is there hesitation on the part of the media to provide the funding necessary for this independent council? Does the Minister honestly expect he will introduce legislation with regard to privacy or that he will depart from his original and apparently current view that no such legislation is necessary?

With regard to funding, I have never known the media interests in Ireland to have an unwillingness to fund an independent press council. They could not reasonably expect the State to fund a press council which was genuinely independent and not accountable to the taxpayer. That is not a runner.

The Act allows for, among other things, the establishment of a Private Security Authority to control and supervise persons providing security services and maintain and improve standards in the provision by it of those services. The functions of the authority include the granting and renewal of licences, the issuing of identity cards to licensees, the suspension or revocation of licences, the specification of standards in the provision of security services, specification of qualification and training requirements and monitoring of the services and service providers in the industry generally.The authority, which is located in Tipperary town and has a current staff complement of eight, has put in place a very ambitious work programme. The primary objective of the Private Security Authority in developing its initial strategy has been to focus on those areas of greatest concern from a public order perspective and within those areas to prioritise the licensing which will give the most immediate results in terms of reducing criminality and getting a distinct grouping licensed in the shortest possible timeframe.The authority will commence licensing private security contractors in October 2005. Licensing of companies in the various sectors of the private security industry will be implemented on a phased basis and the Private Security Authority plans to have licensed all private security employees and companies by the end of 2007.I presume the code of practice referred to by the Deputy relates to the voluntary code of practice to create a safe, secure and efficient cash handling environment in Ireland. The voluntary code has been developed by a forum of stakeholders, including the Garda Síochána, the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the five federated banks and some of the major cash-in-transit security companies. The work of the forum was facilitated by the Irish Bankers Federation, and officials from my Department and the Private Security Authority have been attending the forum as observers.The code of practice, which will be signed by the relevant stakeholders tomorrow, will provide the framework for an end-to-end solution to reduce the risk of cash-in-transit robberies. For security reasons, the document is a confidential one and, therefore, it would not be prudent for me to give details in the House. However, it should be pointed out that this is the first time all the major players in the cash handling environment have agreed collectively to new measures that will raise standards and better manage the risk posed by those criminals who target cash movements.The Private Security Authority has contracted the National Standards Authority of Ireland to develop standards to underpin the licensing of all cash-in-transit companies. It is anticipated the voluntary code of practice will contribute towards the formulation of these standards.

The Government dragged its heels with regard to the Bill. Ireland is the last of all the countries in Europe to introduce regulation, licensing, standards, training, vetting and monitoring of the private security service, but the authority is still not operational. Its members have only recently been appointed and the Minister has just stated that the first licences will not emanate from the authority until October next, and that will only happen on such a phased basis that it will be 2007 before service providers are licensed. Is this not a disgrace? One of the largest industries in the country, in excess of the combined strength of the Garda Síochána and the Army — the public security forces that have stringent regulations and standards — is totally unregulated, with no vetting procedures, no licensing procedures and no standards provided at all. Does the Minister agree this is an area where the black market has operated for a considerable period of time? It is an area infiltrated by questionable people, including redundant paramilitaries, from building site to bouncer. The State has shown no urgency in this matter. Is it not ironic that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has spoken out so strongly on paramilitary and criminal activity, has done nothing to prevent people with dubious credentials from establishing their career in this area and that the State is to blame?

The authority does exist and is located in Tipperary town. It has a staff complement of eight at present. I assure the Deputy that upon the enactment of the legislation this matter was given a high priority in the Department. The necessary arrangements were put in place to establish the authority as a decentralised authority in Tipperary town. A great deal of work and effort was put in by the offices of the Department to see that it happened.As outlined in the reply, the authority has decided to commence licensing the private security contractors in October of this year. The Private Security Authority will commence with sectors for which standards have been developed. On this basis the authority proposes to commence licensing contractors providing door supervisors and security guard services from October. That will be the first sector tackled by the authority.I acknowledge the concerns of the Deputy on the infiltration of this industry by questionable persons. I am not in a position to confirm this to the House but I will draw the attention of the Minister to the concerns of the Deputy. It is a valid concern and it is a matter that requires priority.The establishment of any authority in the public sector takes a period of time. That is what has happened here. The necessary buildings have been secured, the initial staff has been allocated and licensing will start this year. The extension of the licensing will be done on a phased basis and all private security employees and companies will be licensed by the end of 2007. That is the work plan set up by the authority and its decision is that the matter of greatest concern in terms of public order is to prioritise licensing. We empowered it to make this decision by enacting this legislation.

Training mechanisms also have to be set up. He has not referred to how that will operate and if people will reach the standards set by international best practice. The State has dragged its heels to the extent that we still do not know when the sector will be licensed properly. Would the Minister of State agree the area where there are most problems, theft of cash in transit, will only operate on a voluntary code?The purpose of establishing the private security sector authority and legislation was to ensure there would be a mandatory code of practice. Now the Minister has given this sector, including banks, building societies and financial sectors, the opportunity to develop a voluntary code. They were supposed to do this years ago and there is nothing emanating from the authority or the legislation concerning a mandatory code.We do not want to see banks being robbed on a daily basis or cash in transit robbed on a regular basis. With new tiger type hijackings families are put in danger. All the Minister of State can tell us is that a voluntary code will be up and running. The legislation was not introduced for a voluntary code and there should be a better response to what the authority will do.

As such, I am not at present in a position to indicate a start date for construction of the prison complex but the Minister would hope to be in a position to do so within the next few months. I understand that, as with other prison developments, the relevant statute is Part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, SI 600 of 2001. I am not yet in a position to indicate a timescale for commencement of the planning process. The estimated cost of both projects will not be available until detailed designs are completed.The Deputies will be interested to know that the Inspector of Prisons has referred specifically to the need to replace Mountjoy and Portlaoise Prisons in his second annual report and has similarly expressed the need to replace Cork Prison in his report on his visit to the institution.Significant progress is being made in each case. Following conclusion of a recent tender competition, it is hoped that work will commence in the near future on the provision of new prisoner accommodation at Portlaoise Prison as the next phase of redevelopment works there.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	696	I thank the Minister of State for his response, although there was not much in it. Has the Minister of State ever visited Spike Island in his many welcome visits to east Cork? Has his boss, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, ever visited the island to view the facilities? Is the Minister of State, or the Minister, aware of the significant heritage of the island? There was a monastery there, I am told, in the eight century and Spike Island has been compared to Alcatraz, Port Author and Robben Island in its tourism potential and attraction. Is it planned to build the prison inside or outside the present complex? Has an examination been made of the possible visual impact of the prison on other parts of the harbour? How much ground will be taken up by the prison? Is it the Minister's intention to apply for planning permission for the bridge and the prison complex at the same time? Is it not premature to build a bridge to the island if planning for the prison is not forthcoming? How many prisoners will be housed in the proposed new prison on the island?

The island is less than 100 acres in size and I understand that subject to the planning procedures, it may be possible to utilise between 20 and 30 acres for the development. I am not in a position to give the Deputy exact figures on how many the centre will hold when constructed. Under the current legislation the centre is a place of detention rather than a prison, although that may change with the closure of Cork prison.With regard to the environmental issues raised, the Department will prepare an environmental impact statement. Due to the unique nature of this project and its location, it is proposed to publish that statement for public comment and views. Fort Mitchel is a protected structure, famous in our history as the place of incarceration of John Mitchel and its subsequent use as a treaty fort and military installation. That status will be taken into account in any planning application. The Minister has been advised that any other difficulties — Deputy Stanton referred to an ancient monastic site on the island — can be addressed by sensitive architectural treatment and design.

The Minister appreciates the assistance of the local authorities on this project.I understand the position with regard to the sequencing of the planning applications is that planning procedures may involve an environmental impact study and an application for a foreshore licence, as well as the Part 9 application. It is envisaged that this process will take approximately nine months to complete. I understand this will involve one application, but I cannot guarantee that because unforeseen difficulties may arise. The priority at this stage is to get the bridge constructed so that the connection point is available for future construction and eventual use at the installation.

Is that still the intention? Will the whole project be brought to us as one, the prison and the bridge, rather than doing one and not the other?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The construction of the bridge, from commencement of detailed design through tendering and commissioning, will take between 18 months and two years to complete. This includes road links on the landing side. The substantive construction works on the island clearly cannot commence until that project is completed.

Did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform close down Fort Mitchel as part of an ongoing industrial relations dispute with the Prison Officers Association, despite it being one of the more successful prisons in the system? Were most of the prisoners transferred to Cork prison, thereby doubling the numbers there and making it the most overcrowded prison in the country? Were prison officers and families scattered to the four winds when Fort Mitchel closed and are there plans to allow those families to return to their homes?

The Minister is a member of Government and makes his decisions with its authority.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The legislative package already in place for tackling serious and organised crime, including drug trafficking, is recognised as being one of the toughest available to the forces of law and order on the European continental landmass.As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently at Second Stage in the House, provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures that will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. These include a general power with regard to search warrants, including a provision to allow a superintendent to issue an emergency search warrant in certain circumstances, increased detention powers of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences and a statutory power to preserve a crime scene.In addition, Part 3 makes provision for the admissibility as evidence in court of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements. Furthermore, the Minister is considering bringing forward a number of amendments to the Bill, including a proposal to provide for criminal offences with regard to participation in a criminal organisation.There is a particular overriding necessity, in view of the recent increase in violent crime involving firearms, to ensure that public safety and security are given priority in any review of policy and legislation on firearms. With this in mind, the Minister has decided to bring forward at an early stage certain proposals for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill. The Bill as published contains one of those proposals, to provide for the secure custody of firearms. The Minister proposes to increase the sentences for the more serious range of firearms offences, including the possibility of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases, as well as new offences of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence.Operation Anvil launched in May this year by the Garda Síochána is one of the most intensive special policing operations ever undertaken in the State. It is intelligence-driven and is aimed at those involved in gun crime of any kind in the Dublin metropolitan region. This operation involves divisional uniform and detective patrols throughout the region, backed up by national units, overt and covert operations, mobile and foot patrols, random checkpoints at specific locations, searches, execution of warrants and the gathering and collation of high quality criminal intelligence.Operation Anvil is intended to supplement existing operations to ensure that lawlessness does not prevail, that the threat these criminals pose is met sternly and effectively and, above all, that human life is respected.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	712	Does the Minister of State accept there is a major crisis with regard to gangland murders, particularly in Dublin? Nine people have been killed this year so far in gangland murders. Does the Minister of State agree that this figure is too high and unacceptable? Does he accept that life is cheap for some of the people involved in gangland murders? Many people thought things would change after the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin, but the same types of crime are still taking place.Does the Minister of State accept that we need more young active gardaí involved, particularly in the drugs squad, and that we need a more focused response to drug dealers and gangland leaders? I welcome the Minister of State's comment that these operations should be intelligence-driven as this is the key to any strategy. Is the Minister of State amazed that many of our constituents can tell us the known locations of drug dealers operating in our constituencies and selling drugs openly and that our local communities are being intimated? What strategies are in place to deal with this kind of situation?Does the Minister of State accept that our citizens demand action on these gangland murders, particularly the vicious, cold and horrific murders on our streets? It is all very well to respond rapidly to a particular crime but residents and constituents are asking Deputies whether the Government has any serious crime prevention strategies to deal with killers and murderers in a focussed manner. We need such strategies if we are to prevent murders rather than being obliged to preserve crime scenes after they have occurred. Many innocent people have been traumatised and intimidated by the criminal gangs that control estates and blocks of flats. It is horrific to have to live in such complexes after 9 p.m. I ask the Minister of State to make this matter an urgent priority in the coming weeks.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	713	The Deputy has asked some interesting questions. It is important to realise that terms like "gangland killing" and "organised crime" are widely used by the media to refer to certain serious crimes, including unlawful killings of the kind to which the Deputy referred. The media also often suggests that the victims of such crimes were "known to the Garda". The Garda Síochána subjects all murders and violent crimes to detailed and thorough investigation, regardless of the terms used to classify such incidents in public commentary. Caution is necessary when ascribing a motive to a particular incident because this could potentially jeopardise the proper investigative and prosecution procedures which need to be followed by the Garda authorities. All criminal organisations have used violence and intimidation and will continue to do so. As Deputy Finian McGrath correctly stated, we need to put a strategy in place. Our citizens demand action in respect of matters of this nature.Organised crime, which is not a new phenomenon, creates a climate of fear among the general public and among the criminals involved. There are potentially huge profits involved in organised crime and to these criminals, money is power. Many of them are prepared to take whatever action is deemed necessary to protect their positions, including resorting to violence and, in certain cases, committing murder. Killings within the criminal fraternity are usually well planned and conducted. By their nature, they are often more difficult to resolve than other forms of crime. There are often fewer evidential links to aid the Garda's investigations of such matters. I outlined the official strategy for dealing with these matters in my initial reply.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to combat serious crime. Like the Minister, I have met the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel on many occasions to discuss crimes which might be categorised as gangland or organised crime. The Commissioner is satisfied that the necessary operational and financial resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such crimes. The Commissioner has assured me that no effort will be spared in the drive to solve such crimes and to bring those involved to justice.The establishment and operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau is one of the major crime prevention strategies that has been adopted by the State. The bureau continues to enjoy considerable success in depriving persons engaged in criminal activity of the proceeds of such activity. The bureau's activities entail an element of prevention because the removal of the financial substratum of organised criminals leads to the elimination of their capacity to engage in crimes such as those to which Deputy Finian McGrath refers. I am sure the Deputy is aware that the remit of the bureau involves confiscating, freezing or seizing criminal assets, ensuring that criminal proceeds are subject to tax and investigation and determining the eligibility of claims for benefit or assistance under the social welfare code made by criminals or those suspected of criminal activity.Since its statutory inception in October 1996 up to 31 December last, the Criminal Assets Bureau obtained interim and final restraint orders in the value of over €52 million and €23 million, respectively. In the same period, taxes and interest demanded were in excess of €81 million and over €72 million of this was collected. In addition, social welfare savings amounted to over €1.7 million. The Criminal Assets Bureau has enjoyed substantial success and its innovative approach is much admired in other jurisdictions.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	714	What does the Minister of State mean by the term "secure custody of firearms"? How many firearms are stolen in this country each year? How many of these are later used in the commission of criminal offences and murders? Has the Government considered an amnesty in respect of illegally-held firearms? Recent reports suggested that such a possibility is under consideration. Is that notion being examined or is it dead in the water?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	715	I regret that I am not in a position to assist the Deputy in that regard. The Minister has indicated his intention to stiffen existing firearms legislation. I will draw his attention to the Deputy's suggestion that an amnesty be considered in that context.

I have wondered for some time whether there is a case for extending the bureau's powers. Would the Minister of State support such an approach? Although the bureau has been successful, its powers may be limited in some ways. In light of its major success, the House should be prepared to consider any reasonable proposals for an increase in its powers.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	719	Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is gilding the lily somewhat when he suggests that the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau was a major success of the rainbow Government. As I understand it, the Bill that led to the bureau's establishment was initiated by Deputy O'Donoghue when he was in opposition.

It would not be easy to revise that sensitive legislation. I understand that the Department has just completed an exercise of revision of it.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	724	Can the Minister of State outline the outcome of that exercise?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 43 together.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda central vetting unit comprises a Garda inspector, two Garda sergeants, a staff officer, eight clerical officers and three temporarily assigned clerical officers. The unit carries out criminal record vetting in respect of, among other things, prospective full-time employees of the Health Service Executive and certain agencies funded by the executive, as well as prospective child care workers on the equal opportunities child care schemes funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The unit deals with approximately 100,000 vetting applications per annum.The phased extension of the vetting arrangements to relevant sectors and groups involving substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults is about to take place. A working group has been established to examine the practical issues relating to the extension of the vetting arrangements. The group's final report, which was submitted in March 2004, has been published in electronic form on the Department's website.On the basis of the report, I announced that the vetting unit would be given additional staff resources to enable the Garda's vetting services to be extended. The process of increasing the unit's original staffing complement of 13 to 30 has begun. My announcement implemented one of the working group's key recommendations. Other practical recommendations are being implemented by an implementation group chaired by the Garda Síochána and comprising representatives of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science and Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. The chief executive of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Mr. Paul Gilligan, is also a member of the implementation group.The extension of the Garda central vetting unit's services will commence later this year as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place. These arrangements include those pertaining to the decentralisation of the unit to Thurles, County Tipperary, as part of the Government's decentralisation programme. The unit will be given new and modern office accommodation that is tailor-made for its needs. The phased expansion of vetting services will commence when the unit has been established in its decentralised location. Public announcements in this regard will be made in due course.Irrespective of whatever additional arrangements that might be introduced in the future, vetting checks are not the only way to ensure the suitability of applicants for certain posts. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice during the recruitment stage and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements thereafter.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	728	Are there any plans to extend the scope of the Garda vetting unit to cater for people who work in schools as teachers' ancillary staff, those who work in youth clubs and youth facilities and individuals who work for sporting organisations? If so, can the Minister of State indicate the timescale for that extension? The Minister of State might also give us a comparison with vetting practice in the UK. If someone there is found unsuitable to work with children, is such advice passed on to the Irish authorities? If that advice comes regarding someone who has applied to work in a setting not covered in Ireland, can that kind of information be used here and what happens in that regard?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	729	Regarding the Deputy's core question, the new vetting unit in Thurles will be made available to everyone who has substantial unsupervised access to children. That includes a great range of persons in the education sector. It also encompasses many of the voluntary bodies. It has been decided in principle in the Department that there will be no charge to volunteer groups for vetting they seek. We are considering a modest charge for other applications because the Department has found that some employers are inclined to submit far too many applications with regard to the number of posts being filled, and that is a substantial burden on the vetting unit. Many of the positions are of course State positions so it will be a matter of transfer between different State authorities.The report also looked at the wider issues raised by Deputy Stanton and work on them is ongoing in the Department. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I are giving consideration to the introduction of legislation in this area in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the working group on Garda vetting, but it is not possible to give timeframes. The priority is to get the unit up and running in Thurles as quickly as possible.

However, there are arrangements in operation for the exchange of information with the United Kingdom on that database. I do not have the precise details.

We could certainly do with a warning system to ensure the Garda is notified. I am keen to have an assurance from the Minister of State that the system will be fully in place as soon as possible.

The Government subsequently approved the appointment of Eddie Rock as assistant commissioner, with the Commissioner appointing him to take charge of the traffic corps. Never before has the enforcement of road traffic law been given this level of priority within the force. Assistant Commissioner Rock is a member of the top management team in the force and brings authority and visible leadership to the traffic corps from the outset. He has been tasked with implementing the recommendations contained in the Garda Strategic Review of Traffic Policing encompassing a number of resource areas, including human resources, transport and speed detection equipment. Implementation will be over a three and a half to four year period.The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has approved the Minister's proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.

As each cycle of recruit training is completed, the Garda Commissioner will assign these new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities, including the traffic corps. All personnel assigned to the new traffic corps will have completed the standard training programme.I am informed that the strength of the Garda traffic corps over the next four years will rise as follows: to 563 in 2005, to 805 in 2006, to 1,030 in 2007 and to 1,200 in 2008. The assignment of 640 extra gardaí to the traffic corps over the next three years will be made possible through the increase of 2,000 in the force's overall numbers over the period. All gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to enforce road traffic laws. Resources will be deployed in built-up areas, on non-urban regional and local roads, national roads and motorways, to achieve the six strategic objectives for road traffic policing identified in the Strategic Review of Traffic Policing.

Accordingly there is a disproportionate application of speeding fines relative to the population. I asked if the traffic corps would be treated separately in order that the speeding fines would be applied evenly around the country. People often note for example that a Gatso camera van is frequently located at a particular place on the N4 where its task is like shooting fish in a barrel. It is very easy to collect fines in that way. If we are to have a traffic corps which will prevent road traffic accidents, it should look at the profiles of accidents around the country and apportion speeding fines on that basis rather than concentrating on areas where return can be reaped in terms of fines, which is what currently seems to happen. Is this how the traffic corps will operate?

Bhí mé beagnach críochnaithe ag labhairt ar an leasú seo, Uimh. 19, le chéile le hUimh. 20 agus an dá cheann eile ag an deireadh, Uimh. 89 agus 96. Bhí méá rá go raibh cearta daonna i gceist anseo, agus gur cheart go mbeadh an pháirtnéireacht chuí ann idir na gardaí agus na pobail chun tosaíocht a thabhairt dó sin.Is é tosaíocht an príomhrud atá i gceist anseo. Tá an Bille leagtha amach in ord éigin seachas in ord a thosaíochtaí, an gnáthbhealach. Bíonn tosaíocht 1, 2, 3 agus mar sin de ann. Tá mé ag iarraidh dhá cheann eile a chur isteach. Is iad sin an ceann ó thaobh cearta daonna de, ach go háirithe, agus an ceann ó thaobh ról na ngardaí de agus iad ag tabhairt ceannaireachta don phobal áitiúil.When I spoke earlier about the human rights audit, I referred to a document which I said was short enough at 23 pages. I now see that it is just the executive summary which is 23 pages long, so clearly the document itself is a lot longer. I scanned through the document again and perhaps we might return to it later to ensure that An Garda Síochána is implementing much of its findings. The audit sought to find out if there was a human rights ethos within the Garda and it raised a number of detailed questions. It first asked how human rights were made relevant to police work. The answers given were grouped and analysed. The commission then came to its conclusions and presented them. The report makes scary reading, despite the human rights initiative having operated within An Garda Síochána for five years. My amendment proposes that an objective of An Garda Síochána should be to promote and protect human rights. In doing so, gardaí would have to comply with the majority if not all the recommendations of the human rights audit carried out by Ionann management consultants and it is only right to expect that.My other amendment relates to Garda protection of the security of our communities and the provision of positive leadership. Despite the Joycean trip around my constituency suggested by the Minister, the experience in my constituency highlights a model which I hope is reflected elsewhere. I mentioned a number of policing fora in my constituency yesterday through which the Garda worked well with the community. I have been trying in my amendments to promote a police service which interacts well with the community but which also understands its role within the community. Many of the Bill's provisions are in line with that and the change in emphasis is welcome but the legislation does not go far enough. My amendments propose that we go as far as we can to ensure An Garda Síochána is part of the community, is reflective of the community and works with the community by giving the leadership a police service can with the support of other service providers and the community.I commend my amendments to the House. It will be interesting if the Minister rejects them because I cannot see how anybody could vote against such a proposition. It would be a major statement that we, in this House, will not allow members of An Garda Síochána to abuse and breach people's human rights and that if members do, they do so contrary to the objectives of the force. They should be dealt with by the force and the State accordingly.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	741	We spent a great deal of time on this crucial section on Committee Stage because it deals with the functions of the Garda. It is worth deliberating for some time on what the force's functions should be in modern day Ireland. Should its primary function merely be to provide policing and security services for the State without reference to the citizen? Should its priorities be the preservation of peace and public order, the protection of life and property, the protection of the security of the State, which is referred to in section 6(1), bringing criminals to justice and regulating and controlling road traffic? As an afterthought, section 6(3) provides that, in addition to providing policing and security services — I am not sure how road traffic fits in with that — the Garda should have a role in immigration.A great deal of messy thinking went into the drafting of the section. It is not coherent and it was not carefully thought out. In addition, it is not presented in a manner that puts the citizen first. During Private Members' business this week, I referred to the statement issued when the metropolitan police was established in 1829 and the enlightened manner in which the first commissioner, Sir Charles Rowan, outlined the role and the function of the force. He stated: "Every member of the force must remember that his duty is to protect and help members of the public, no less than to apprehend guilty persons." Members of the force were given a broad responsibility to deal with the public in a protective and helpful fashion. Rowan further stated: "Consequently, whilst prompt to prevent crime and arrest criminals, he must look upon himself as the servant and guardian of the general public." That is where the notion of the new police force as the servant of the people emanated from on the foundation of this State.As we move through the 21st century, that notion has been lost to an extent in the Minister's outline of the functions of the Garda. The section refers to the provision of policing and security services for the State, which is blunt but not comprehensive. That is not what one would expect in a generous, open democracy, especially when one considers the progress in the development of the European Union model, the European Convention on Human Rights, which Ireland has ratified, and our Constitution, which espouses the individual rights of citizens. This is not reflected in the Minister's presentation of the core functions of the Garda.We, in the Opposition, have attempted to put the citizen first in our amendments. Deputy Ó Snodaigh seeks the protection and promotion of human rights while I have proposed a function that not only preserves life and property but also the human rights of individuals within the State. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment seeks the respect of human rights of each individual. We should be able to rise to make that a core function of the Garda in this democracy in the 21st century.The Minister will reply that he has not forgotten human rights and the entitlements of the citizen because they have been provided for in section 6(4), which states: "In performing its functions, the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights." That is all very well but the force must have regard to many guidelines in performing its duties. This is a residual rather than a primary entitlement, which it would be if it were inserted as a core function.Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the human rights audit conducted a few months ago which found the Garda to be severely lacking in a number of areas. The force left a great deal to be desired regarding the manner in which human rights were dealt with, respected and protected during its operations. I was happy that the Commissioner responded with alacrity and indicated that he would take on board every criticism in the human rights audit and take immediate steps to improve the situation. The audit is a substantial document comprising a couple of hundred pages of examination and critical assessment of the role and operations of the Garda Síochána. Given that it was found wanting in that respect so recently, one would have thought that the Minister would have taken that message on board in his presentation of the functions of the Garda.Protecting the personal integrity of the State's citizens is one of the functions of the Garda Síochána. Detecting crime, pursuing criminals and so forth are also functions. The core function, however, must be the protection of life and the personal integrity of the citizen. The Minister should find a formula to include that in the legislation. It must be highly placed in the order of functions of the Garda. The new Garda Síochána will be committed to serving the citizen and the State and to protecting the bodily integrity of the citizen. That is what is required rather than the somewhat ad hoc list of functions and objectives included in an incoherent fashion in the Bill. The Minister could delete some of the later subsections and make clear what the primary functions of the Garda are.They should be in accordance with our amendments. The fact that all the parties on this side of the House have put forward similar amendments indicates that there is something lacking in the Minister's expression of the functions of the Garda. The Minister could make some effort to take these proposals on board.This is an important section and seems to state clearly what the primary core functions of the Garda Síochána are. It would be a shame if the Minister were not prepared to include the function that this side of the House considers to be absent. He is prepared to include "regulating and controlling road traffic" as a primary function or core value of the Garda. It is not, it is just one of the things gardaí must do and it is important that they do it. However, it is not at the same level of importance as protecting the human rights of citizens or protecting the bodily integrity of the citizen. I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider the amendment in that context.

I invite the Minister to join that club. I am surprised that an issue such as the protection of human rights is not deemed sufficiently important to be a key function of the Garda Síochána. This matter was raised by the Human Rights Commission but I am not sure of the Minister's views on those who have a strong interest in human rights. I recollect a vague, slighting reference he made to some of them as being part of the human rights industry. If that is his personal view, it should not be reflected in legislation.In modern times there is greater recognition of the importance of human rights. From that point of view it would be useful and progressive to include among the functions in section 7 that the Garda respect the human rights of each individual. It is not the end of the world if it is not included but I hope it will be. It could then possibly be a part of the training course or the re-training of gardaí. It is an effort to put the issue in lights, as it were. In the context of the new culture that we hope will develop in the Garda Síochána it would be useful to have it in this section.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	743	I strongly support amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 22. They are positive and constructive, particularly amendments Nos. 19 and 20. Amendment No. 19 refers to "protecting and promoting human rights". This is a topical and important issue. Internationally, standards appear to be dropping. It is also happening in this country. We must be on our guard with regard to respect for a human rights culture. That is important in the context of the debate on these amendments.Issues such as Guantanamo Bay and the case of the Miami five show where there have been major abuses. That is unacceptable, internationally or nationally. We must be vigilant on this issue. Recent events in this country have shown that the human rights of the McBrearty family were attacked and destroyed. This also affected Mark McConnell and Richie Barron, his family and friends. The human rights of the victims must also be accorded the same importance. If these amendments are not included in the legislation, there will be potential for other miscarriages of justice in the future. We have seen what happened to the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and other cases, including the McBrearty family.Amendment No. 19 is a reminder that we must be vigilant. Human rights apply to everybody. When talking about the human rights of prisoners, we must ensure that in defending those human rights we also defend the human rights of other citizens. People who are genuinely interested in human rights issues are often perceived or presented as anti-Garda. This is unacceptable for people who support human rights. It is not an option. If one supports human rights, it does not necessarily mean one is anti-Garda. One is pro-Garda and pro-quality policing. When one discusses this with gardaí, they are the first to accept that.Amendment No. 20 is a strong amendment. It deals with protecting the security of and providing positive leadership in our communities. It is important that the security of communities is protected. Special attention should be paid to disadvantaged communities where the people's human rights are not being protected every day of the week. Families are living in flat complexes and huge estates dominated by drug barons and gang leaders. They intimidate people. After 9 p.m., it becomes a nightmare to live in many of these places. We should reflect on and support the human rights of the people to whom I refer.It is not acceptable that the door to the flat of a disabled woman is kicked in every night while drug pushers are on the stairway outside. If she complains, she is intimidated. It is not acceptable that when elderly women telephone for help they receive an inadequate response when there are known drug dealers within 50 m of their front doors. These are the community issues surrounding amendment No. 20 which is concerned with respecting people's human rights, particularly those of communities.In part of my constituency some years ago, the drug squad confiscated approximately €20 million worth of drugs. I commend it on that. Many people in the area, however, said it was only a small portion of what was happening. The Minister said today that there have been nine gangland murders this year. That may sound like a small number but those nine people should not have been murdered. Their deaths are connected with gangland activity and the widespread intimidation and fear it involves.When I refer to human rights, I refer to the broad concept. Amendment No. 20 deals with the security of communities and the need to provide positive leadership. This is an issue for us, as legislators, and, in particular, for the Minister and other members of the Cabinet. We need to provide positive leadership in respect of it.If legislation incorporates human rights, it prevents future cases of human rights abuses. This is an excellent proposal, not only in human terms but also in terms of cost in regard to State funding using taxpayers' money. For example, taxpayers will have to pay a couple of million euro for the McBrearty family's court and tribunal costs. The McBreartys deserve that payment. Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 22 are progressive because, as well as being positive in nature, they will prevent future human rights abuses.We must also accept that the views of the Irish public towards the accountability of the Garda Síochána reflect international trends and attitudes to police forces. According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2004, respondents viewed the Irish police force as the fourth most corrupt sector, with political parties perceived as the most corrupt. It is interesting that political parties are viewed as more corrupt than the police force. The Irish police force scored 3.1 on a scale from not corrupt, 1, to extremely corrupt, 5. Political parties scored 3.9 and the media — none of whose members are here — scored 2.8. The military came out of the survey very well at 2.1. This is quality research on these issues.These human rights issues are linked to accountability and professionalism in the police force. Amendment No. 20 is connected to communities. People who try to prevent crime in their communities should not be persecuted. I recall many cases of communities taking action against drug pushers only to be ridiculed and attacked in this House and in the media. I attended many of their meetings and marches and saw what was going on. They were trying to win back their communities yet they got only grief from many people in the so-called political establishment in this House. It is important, when talking about protecting the security of our communities, to also provide positive leadership.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 22 deals with respecting the human rights of each individual. That applies equally to prisoners and gardaí, to women living in flats complexes and to families living on large estates who are victimised and terrorised every night. It is not acceptable to allow that type of society to continue. We need proactive policies to deal with it and a quality drug squad that is prepared to target the resources. It should be intelligence-driven to deal with gangland leaders and drug barons so that the innocent are not caught up in criminal activity and are not bullied or intimidated.Many innocent people, such as Mr. Fitzgerald, the bouncer at a Limerick nightclub, have paid the price for community action. I have met many people from Limerick who admired him. I understand that an individual is being charged with that crime. Many families have told me of Mr. Fitzgerald's efforts to prevent the spread of drug abuse and intimidation and occasionally to save teenagers in Limerick.It is only fair to pay tribute to someone of that integrity and calibre. Mr. Fitzgerald was just one of many such people. I know many individuals in my constituency who have put their lives at risk to defend their communities but who have been intimidated and bullied. They continue nevertheless to do this work, often on their own. It is up to us, as Members of the Oireachtas, to ensure that their human rights are protected, especially those of the communities in the poorest areas.People in most affluent communities are generally able to hire the proper back-up and advice. There are many people who have neither the ability nor the resources to protect themselves. These amendments add a human and a professional dimension to the legislation. I hope they will be accepted and lead to a radical change in the Garda Síochána, in society generally and in terms of how all people are treated.

All organs of the State are bound to uphold the Constitution and its values, and to act in a manner both consonant with it and demonstrably constitutional in every respect. That is not written into every statute but it is a fundamental rule of our law that every body created by law, and every organ under the Constitution, is bound by a fundamental duty to uphold the Constitution. This entails implementing constitutional values and working towards the achievement of constitutional aims.Article 40.3.1 of the Constitution states "The State guarantees in its laws to respect ... and vindicate the rights of the citizen." That is a fundamental duty of every organ of the State. It applies to the Garda Síochána, the Army, the Oireachtas and the courts. That duty to uphold the rights of the citizen imbues every statutory creature this House brings into being.No body established under our statute is independent of, or free from, the duty to uphold the Constitution or the duty of the State to protect and vindicate the rights of the citizen. That obligation goes further in regard to fundamental rights and involves citizens and non-citizens alike. The State must vindicate the fundamental rights of those present in our country regardless of whether they are citizens.It gives me some pleasure to say that the source from which most of section 7 emanates is the Northern Ireland Police Act 1998.

It is a case of "Four legs good, two legs bad". If it is north of the Border, it must be perfect, and everything that we do down here is second-rate in comparison. In section 18 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, the general functions of the police force were stated to be to protect life and property, to preserve order, to prevent the commission of offences and, where an offence has been committed, to take measures to bring the offender to justice. Those are the functions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland as stated as recently as 1998 in its founding statute. I mention that solely to remind the House that what we are doing here is talking about the function of the Garda Síochána in the State. It is to provide policing and security services for the State, and its objectives are to preserve peace and public order, to protect life and property, to protect the security of the State, to prevent crime, to bring criminals to justice, including by detecting and investigating crime, and to regulate and control road traffic and improve road safety.

Into that section we inserted the provision "In performing its functions, the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights." If subsection (4) had been transposed and made subsection (1), and the first thing stated regarding the functions of the Garda Síochána had been that "In performing its functions, the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights", I do not think that we would be having this debate. However, because we took the Northern Ireland functions and added a few to them, with a new clause not present in the Northern Ireland Bill, it is somehow implied that we are downgrading the vindication of human rights in our society.I do not agree with that. It is because the draftsman carefully inserted into this Bill that in doing everything, whether regulating road traffic, preventing crime, protecting the State's security, keeping peace and public order or bringing criminals to justice, "the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights". That is across the board and a value explicitly stated in this statute. From that point of view, the draftsman got it right.I can understand where Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment comes from, but the objective is not to respect human rights. Respecting human rights is a constant value with which one must imbue all one's activities. Perhaps that is a matter of semantics, but there is no great division in principle. The law, as proposed in this Bill, does not dismiss human rights or downgrade them. It states that they will be an important duty for the Garda Síochána.I ask the Deputies to consider section 15, which provides——

It provides that a member of the Garda Síochána must make a declaration on the following lines:I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare before God that—I will faithfully discharge the duties of a member of the Garda Síochána with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality, upholding the Constitution and the laws and according equal respect to all peopleThat is the duty of every member of the Garda Síochána. Making that declaration shows a fundamental commitment to human rights and constitutional values. Effectively, it is written into the contract of every aspirant member of the Garda Síochána. The Act states that, in pursuing its policing functions, which are similar to those of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the need to uphold human rights.We could write human rights into virtually every section of this Bill if we wished, and some people might be tempted to do so, but let us remember that this Bill is subject to the Constitution and must be construed in accordance with it. Since 2004, it has had to be interpreted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is made very clear from the attestation oath or declaration of members of the force and the section that states that the force's functions that human rights are central to the activities of the Garda Síochána, and upholding them is a central value in carrying out every function, whether that be policing a U2 concert, interrogating a suspect, engaging in covert surveillance, community policing or dealing with young people or domestic violence. However one wishes to look at it, upholding human rights is stated in this statute to be a value that the Garda Síochána must bring to all its activities. I do not know how many times more that can be said. It is clear as day that upholding human rights is included in the Bill as presented to this House. No one could be against human rights.

To retain both would seem like poor draftsmanship, involving a repetition of what is said in the top paragraph at the bottom paragraph. If there is a consensus in regard to modifying Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment in this way and accepting a consequential amendment to remove subsection (4), I am willing to do so. This will prevent the House from dividing on the issue of human rights, a subject on which I presume we do not disagree.

If colleagues are agreeable, I welcome the proposal to accept my amendment as modified to use the word "vindicating". This would be stronger than subsection (4).

We are trying to achieve some insertion in this section to the effect that one of the core functions of the Garda Síochána is to respect and vindicate the rights of individuals. "Vindicating" is probably a better word than "respecting"——

However, I also ask the Minister to consider whether the amendment should refer to "each individual" or "each person". I have my own amendment No. 21 in mind in querying whether "persons" is the correct word. Although that amendment refers to the "human rights of individuals", I was subsequently unsure whether "persons" might be a better word. I am not sure whether the Minister would consider it more appropriate.

Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has indicated that "vindicating" is a good word to use and I welcome the Minister's response on this. However, regarding the Minister's comments about some of those concerned about human rights issues, those of us who constantly push that agenda totally accept that citizens have duties and responsibilities as well as rights. I reject the argument put forward by some who constantly demand their rights without any recognition of a need to adhere to civic duties. I accept that point. The latter is not a real human rights vision. In view of what the Minister has said, I welcome the proposal.

Perhaps he will explain that. This is the proper place to include such an objective. My amendment No. 89 flows from this in that the Garda Commissioner would have the duty to ensure this objective is promoted. If the Minister's proposal ensures it will be a duty to vindicate people's human rights, that is in line with what I have attempted in amendment No. 89.My amendment No. 20 refers to the duty of the Garda to protect the security of our communities and to provide positive leadership within communities. The Minister has not given an adequate response on this issue. The inclusion of such a duty makes it a separate priority to those of protecting life and property. For too long, it has seemed for many communities that the priority of An Garda Síochána and its officers was to protect private property over and above the well-being of communities. This is one of the reasons I wished to insert this clause and it is important that it should be included in this part of the Bill.The Minister referred to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. It is important that he should not be limited by that legislation. A desire for equivalence should not prevent us from going beyond the legislative provisions in place in Northern Ireland and attempting to set the standards. We have tended to look to the Patten report because the compilation of that report involved such an extensive trawl of policing models throughout the world. It has become a standard by which many societies are guided in terms of police reform. However, we should aim to set the standard beyond what is contained in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 and thereby force the authorities in that jurisdiction to react to the standards and positive changes in our legislation.

In page 11, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:"(3) In achieving its objectives and performing its functions, the Gardaí shall have available to it modern and effective communications systems and leading edge technology for the recording of crime and the collation of data.".I always held the view that the Garda Síochána should be the best police force in the world. Some of our painstaking efforts on this Bill are to lay the legislative basis for that. We have to look beyond bare legislation from the point of view of how best to achieve the desired outcome. It would be useful to highlight the fact that we cannot expect our police force to be the best in the world without providing the Garda with the most modern and effective communications systems and leading edge technologies for recording crime and collating data. This objective is shared by everybody in this House. Establishing this in legislation would reinforce the commitment to achieve that objective and provide the necessary resources to do so.It would also instill the extra confidence which the Garda Síochána needs at present. Gardaí would realise that, while we set and demand high standards and results of them, we are prepared to support our approach with a commitment, underpinned by legislation, to provide the best resources and, in particular, modern technology so as to enable them achieve these results. This is my thinking on this matter. There is nothing dramatic about it. If gardaí felt that this message was coming from Leinster House, it could have a positive influence on morale.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	823	I fully agree with Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment. We discussed it on Committee Stage, when I believed that the Minister was interested in what was being said on the matter. It is a problem which we currently face with regard to the Garda. We have received complaints on mobile communication as well as in terms of the PULSE computer data and delays on the inputting of material and the management of that. The significant problems experienced with the roll-out of CCTV will be addressed in this legislation. However, it has dragged on for a long time. We saw the incredible situation in Donegal, where gardaí did not preserve the scene of the crime and did not seem to realise the importance of doing so. Even where hair, skin and blood was found, they simply walked or drove away from the situation.Yesterday, Deputy Cowley described similar deaths, in counties Donegal and, I think, Mayo, where the crime scenes were not preserved for some reason. This was possibly because a traffic accident was involved. Whether it was a crime is another day's work. However, if the scene is not preserved, it is impossible to determine this. I have questions on the area of forensics. For far too long the Garda Síochána has relied on statements made by suspects to determine the outcome of crimes. In many cases this is the main evidence available and presented in court. Statements made by suspects should be down the list of importance of evidence. We should now be at the cutting edge of technology in forensic examination of a crime scene. We see daily on our television screens the extent to which the FBI can solve crimes throughout the United States. Every piece of information found on a crime from Alaska to Honolulu is packaged away and sent to the FBI who examine it so carefully and minutely that they are able to develop trends and strands and solve many crimes.We have much to learn. Forensics is at a basic level here. We should have moved away from having trials within trials whereby after a jury is empanelled, it must wait a week or two while a judge hears argument on whether material such as confessions and statements is admissible in court. This should not happen as it delays trials, takes up people's time and causes expense.There is too much reliance on the extraction of evidence or confessions during questioning of suspects. Perhaps that will all change when we have audio and video recording in all Garda stations and I was heartened to hear the Minister state we are at approximately 90%——

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	825	That is wonderful. We can expect that all trials in the near future will not have that element where there is no technical back-up for statements that appear as part of the evidence and we will have the tape recording presented to court as support for any statements made.We discussed having a root and branch examination of the Garda Síochána, and we must have such an examination of how it deals with crime scenes and crimes in general. The only crimes solved, except for a small number, are where people make confessions and people admit to them. In many cases this admission is to a lesser offence. It would be interesting to have proper statistical analysis and audit of what happens in our courts to see the level of Sherlock Holmes or FBI style success rate. It is extremely low.Where there is pressure on the Garda Síochána it relies on admissions, extractions, questioning and interrogations. This, in many cases, has given a bad name to the methodologies used from the time of the heavy gang in the 1970s through to some activities at the present time. How could one have possibly extracted a confession from Frank McBrearty Jr. to a murder that never happened? How did that occur? Where is the answer to that? What pressure was brought to bear on him or who wrote the confession? If there was no murder there could not be a confession to a murder unless the gentleman in question was so perverse that in some strange way he wanted to take a dive of some description in relation to the criminal justice system. It is not tenable or logical. These serious questions must be answered.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raises the point that gardaí, in the performance of their duties, must have a good quality communications system. That is essential as the last thing one needs is to have criminals roaming the country with the ability to tune in to Garda wavelengths and listen to conversations. I understand that gardaí must often operate from their own mobiles because there has not been sufficient upgrading of Garda technology.We could extend this amendment to not just cover the recording of crime and the collection and examination of data, but to include the work that must be carried out on that data, how comprehensively it can be done, and the forensic mechanisms available to examine the wide variety of data now available. This would enable us to move away from human to human, or garda to suspect, crime solution.We are not at the cutting edge in this area which means we still rely on old methodologies that can give rise to many complaints. With our new Garda ombudsman or ombudsman commission, or whatever it will be when we finally leave here tonight, we must ensure gardaí can operate efficiently and effectively without entering a grey twilight zone of placing undue pressure on people to make statements they would not otherwise make as the only means of solving a crime.I do not know if the Minister has plans in that area or whether Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald's brief arising from the Donegal saga deals with it. I know his work is divided into approximately half a dozen headings to improve Garda operations and ensure the mistakes outlined by the Morris report are not made again. I hope one of the key areas he addresses is that of forensics and how modern technology can be employed to deal with crime. If that alone were done, and the Garda Síochána's view of crime solution was shifted from extracting a response from a person to dealing with the technological aspects that arise in every crime scene, we would have a good day's work done in improving the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. It would also reduce the number of complaints forthcoming from people taken into custody or questioned.Under the Criminal Justice Bill the Minister gives power to extend the period for which people can be detained for the purpose of questioning from eight hours to 24 hours without arrest. That is a serious change in the manner in which business is done. Up to 1984 people could not be questioned without being arrested. Now it will be the norm. It means many people will be brought in for questioning where evidence may not be as strong as it was in the past when arrest was necessary. We are coming in to a new age. If the Minister is to introduce the Criminal Justice Bill with all the extra powers it confers on the Garda Síochána and with the restrictions it imposes on citizens' rights in many areas, it is important he examines this area to try to obviate the need for the face to face activities that give rise to so many problems. There is much scope in the Bill in that respect.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	826	There would be a consensus on the thinking behind these amendments but the Bill is not the place to insert a wish list of items relating to technology or the like.To give the House some information on, for instance, Garda communications, when I came into office I was made aware of a project that was being planned to purchase a digital radio system for the Garda Síochána at a cost of €200 million to €300 million. My major concern in regard to any item of that size and significance is whether we would get the right equipment or, having spent the €200 million or €300 million and had the usual overruns, I would be told a week later in the Garda Review that it was a poor system that was not as good as some other I should have purchased elsewhere. The recurring nightmare whenever the public sector and information technology come together is that a massive amount of money will be spent, we will be told it was the wrong purchase and be stuck with the wrong system.Instead of that the CMOD unit in the Department of Finance is now putting together a package to offer a contract to run a system of digital communication for the Garda Síochána. It will be available also to the other blue light services — ambulance, Civil Defence, the Army and others who want to join in the system — so we will have a digital radio system across the State for State purposes. I am pleased the contracts for that will be going out to tender in January 2006. That is a much better outcome than what was about to happen otherwise and I am enthusiastically promoting it.We have had pilot programmes on digital radio and we are aware of the issues. It is wrong in this day and age that gardaí are using analogue transmissions which are the subject of scanners by serious criminals. That cannot be stood over. Curiously, it may be that on occasion they would be better off using their digital phones than a radio transmission which is open to scanning. No Minister could stand over that and it is my intention to ensure the Garda Síochána has cutting edge technology available to it because our criminal confraternity is at the cutting edge in using technology for its purposes. It is wrong that the Garda Síochána should be following in the wake of events rather than be at the forefront of technological development.I take Deputy Costello's point about issues such as forensics. However, while video recording takes place currently in 96% of cases, and a recent Superior Court judgment suggested that failure to record a confessional type statement, save in the most extraordinary circumstances, could have serious implication for those statements — we are moving rapidly to 100% — we should remind ourselves that Parliament passed a law relatively recently requiring judges to warn juries that uncorroborated confessions had to be dealt with with caution. That reinforces Deputy Costello's point that there must be corroboration if we are to have that kind of material. Nowadays, with DNA in particular, low level DNA is left in an extraordinary set of circumstances. If it is used it is very useful for giving the gardaí a clue as to who they are dealing with because it is almost impossible to grip the steering wheel of a car without leaving a trace of DNA behind. Even though in many cases such low level DNA may not prove guilt, it can provide the gardaí with a clue as to who they should be seeking. The question of DNA databanks for convicted criminals also comes into question in that respect. We should give the gardaí every possible technological assistance.Going back to the Richie Barron death, which was such a terrible event, it beggars belief that there was not either the system or the equipment available to put a tent over the locus in quo where human flesh was found on a roadway in those circumstances. That is an issue which is addressed to some extent in the Criminal Justice Bill — the right to preserve a scene, including on private property. Apart from having legal provision for it, systems training and equipment are also issues. From what I gather from the Sophie Tuscan du Plantier case, and I say this as a layman not as Minister, there was a failure to have adequate protective equipment to preserve the scene long enough for forensic scientists and pathologists to get to it to make their examination. Those are issues on which there is major scope for learning and improvement in practice.I agree the force must do everything the Deputies opposite spoke about but I do not see any particular reason to start making aspirational provision for it in the Bill. Imagine if the amendment stated the opposite, namely, "In achieving its objectives and performing its functions, the Gardaí shall not have available to it modern and effective communications systems and leading edge technology for the recording of crime and the collation of data". The amendment contains a fairly self-evident proposition that this is a desirable state of affairs.There are many provisions I would like to include in the Bill such as a provision that every interview should be recorded or that the scene of a crime should never again be left in the state that Mr. Justice Morris found regarding the accident involving Richie Barron. This legislation is not meant to be a series of aspirations or best practice guidelines given by legislators to the gardaí. This is a constitutional framework for the Garda Síochána and it will be in the context of directives, annual policing plans, the professional standards units and the inspectorate that best practice will evolve and that issues of this kind will be brought to the fore rather than by contenting ourselves that we have dealt with the matter because we have put something on the Statute Book.Whereas I fully accept what Deputy O'Keeffe is trying to achieve in his amendments Nos. 24 and 85, in truth they are better put into practice rather than left on the dusty page of a statute. Putting them in a statute does not advance the issue one way or the other. I ask Deputy O'Keeffe not to press the amendment, having fully accepted the gravamen of what he and Deputy Costello said about the importance of these issues.

I listened to the Minister's response and I take on board the fact that he accepted there is a need for the best resources and technology, whether it be from the point of view of communications or otherwise, and that they must be made available to the Garda Síochána. The message should go from this House on a unanimous basis that we are prepared to do that and that the exercise in which we are involved is not only a bashing exercise or a demanding exercise. Having said that, there are some demands and I have no hesitation in demanding the highest standards from the Garda Síochána. However, if that message is coupled with a commitment to providing the best resources and equipment to the Garda Síochána to enable its members to achieve those high standards and to have best practice, I will be satisfied.However, as I understand the point of not recording every such aspiration in legislation, I will not press the amendment at this stage.

The Parliamentary Counsel provided an improved formulation which I hope is satisfactory to everyone.

I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 25:To delete "has such functions as are conferred on it" and substitute "and its members have such functions as are conferred on them".The Minister is correct that I was initially unhappy with the wording of the section. Section 7(3) states: "In addition to providing policing and security services, the Garda Síochána's functions are to provide any other services ...". I sought to tighten this up by stating the Garda Síochána "shall" provide services. The Minister then introduced amendment No. 25. My amendment is to the effect that it is not proper to refer to the Garda Síochána as a body and that the Bill should refer to the members of the Garda Síochána. If amendment No. 25 was allowed to stand, it would be improper in a legal fashion.While I do not have a general difficulty with the manner in which the Minister has tried to introduce the amendment, it is flawed if left as it is. All of the functions under subsection (1) were those referring to the functions of the Garda Síochána, such as preserving the peace and public order. Then, we are referring to a function that is not the function of——

The Bill at section 6 makes a statement as to duty and functions but this is effectively removed at section 7(5). Having made a positive statement, the Bill now negatives this and provides an opt-out or disregard.The subsection states that the section "does not affect any powers" of "any other enactment or at common law". What does that mean? The powers of a garda or of the police force at common law are widespread. At common law a garda has powers of arrest and powers to act independently without reference to a commissioner or anybody else. The powers of common law do not come within the ambit of the statute. They are wider powers granted to the original constables. What is the meaning of this subsection? Can a member of the Garda Síochána operate independently under common law as a surrogate peace officer, with all powers of arrest, based on his or her opinion and without reference to anyone else?I am not satisfied on two counts, first, that the Minister should take away from the proactive strength of what is being proposed and, second, I am not clear what is meant by "any other enactment" or "common law" in this context. I see the common law as having given a certain degree of independence to a member of the Garda Síochána that can be operated irrespective of other duties that might be conferred by statute.

He was supposed to chase around his patch making sure these noxious weeds were not present. That is a statutory function the police had under that legislation. The mere fact that one may find chasing ragwort around fields difficult to reconcile with section 7(1) does not mean gardaí no longer have that function. That is what this section does. We do not want a situation where a garda exercises some power under the Musk Rats Act or the Noxious Weeds Act, and a clever lawyer asks in court how this is compatible with section 7 of the Garda Síochána Act. Since the Garda Síochána Bill comes after previous legislation the clever lawyer might argue its effect was to wipe out areas of competence for the Garda Síochána existing under common law or statute. That is what we are trying to prevent. Deputy Costello's amendment is implying that no power under any statute, such as the Noxious Weeds Act, will survive this unless it is compatible with section 7(1). We do not want to go down that road.One of the things we try to avoid in this House is unintended consequence. I do not want a situation where some clever young lawyer will announce that a whole collection of law has become unenforceable because it cannot easily be tied into the objectives set out in section 7(1).I will give the Deputy an example of the common law power of the police. There is plenty of case law, in the UK at any rate, that the police have as part of their common law powers. They have the power to take pre-emptive action to stop a breach of the peace or to stop hunters. In order to stop things getting out of control the police can intervene in a pre-emptive way. These are a constable's common-law powers, similar to what the Garda Síochána have under our system. I do not want that to be obliterated on the afternoon of 23 June 2005 in the Dáil by our setting out functions for gardaí that do not seem to uphold that power.

In page 12, line 30, after "circumstances" to insert the following:"either at all or without a specific direction from the Director of Public Prosecutions".This relates to the desire of the Minister that all prosecutions emanate from the Director of Public Prosecutions and to give a standard, unifying mechanism for prosecutions. If my amendment were accepted section 8(5) would read:Directions under subsection (4) may be of a general or specific nature and may, among other things, prohibit members of the Garda Síochána from—(a) instituting or conducting prosecutions of specified types of offences or in specified circumstances, either at all or without a specific direction from the Director of Public Prosecutions.This makes clear that the Director of Public Prosecutions is entitled to prohibit members from instituting certain kinds of proceedings, either at all or without specific reference to him. It seems this would improve the situation by clarifying it. It is consistent with what the Minister seeks to achieve in this legislation, namely, prohibiting members of the Garda Síochána from the institution of prosecutions and transferring the function exclusively to the DPP.

I undertook to consult with the DPP on similar provisions, which Senator Tuffy raised in the Seanad. The DPP agrees with my view that amendment No. 33 is not required. Concerning amendment No. 34 the DPP believed the proposed amendment would cause difficulties in the prosecution of cases. I do not want to make the life of the DPP more difficult so I am not disposed to accepting it. The DPP was also in agreement with my view that amendment No. 35 was an unnecessary provision. Though I consulted with the DPP on those three counts we are not bound by him. I am deferential to his views as he will have to live with all of this. The reaction of the DPP was to urge me not to accept these amendments.

Let us consider amendment No. 35. It reads:In page 12, line 44, after "Síochána" to insert the following:"(which the Director of Public Prosecutions is hereby empowered to do)".In this legislation the section "precludes the Director of Public Prosecutions from, at any stage of the proceedings, assuming the conduct of a prosecution instituted by a member of the Garda Síochána". This amendment positively confirms that the DPP is empowered.

The DPP would not accept that proposition.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	856	Would the Minister not accept that proposition? There must be thousands of prosecutions that take place in the District Court every year about which the DPP has no clue. Let us consider amendment No. 34, which states:In page 12, line 40, after "direction" to insert the following:", provided that where it is ascertained that a failure to comply with this section or that direction has occurred, the criminal prosecution concerned shall be stayed pending a specific direction from the Director of Public Prosecutions".If the DPP is taking responsibility for a prosecution as instituted by the Garda Síochána, for whatever reason, surely there is need for some mechanism and a period of time to enable the DPP to come on board and be informed of the situation so he can give specific direction on the matter. By and large, the DPP knows nothing of what is taking place in the District Court. It is at a later stage, relating to matters of indictment, that the DPP is aware of prosecutions taking place. If we are to tighten up this process it is important that we are more specific and that there is the space and time for specific direction from the DPP if that office is taking over from the Garda Síochána, which instituted it. It has been instituted in the name of the DPP but that does not mean he or she knows about it. The process is a formality. It should be built into the legislation that he is empowered to take over the direction. It should be specified that there will be a period of time for him to be able to direct the prosecution after it has been initiated by somebody else. By tabling these amendments, I am trying to put the Director of Public Prosecutions more at the centre in dealing positively with matters.

The first amendment is already comprehended in the section which is establishing a framework within which the DPP will operate. The section deals with the question of directions by the DPP in any event, and the Office of the DPP is in agreement with this view.As regards the second amendment, the intention behind subsection (6) is to ensure a prosecution will not be invalidated because a garda has failed to comply with a direction from the DPP. There is a similar provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1984, which provides that a prosecution is not invalidated by reason of a breach of the custody regulations. The latter is, of course, a more serious matter. The DPP's office maintains the proposed amendment would cause difficulties in the prosecution of cases and for that reason the Minister is opposed to it.The Minister is also opposed to the third amendment, which he considers to be unnecessary, and the DPP's office is in agreement with the Minister in this regard. In short, therefore, the Minister has consulted with the Director of Public Prosecutions who is satisfied with the framework envisaged in section 8. These amendments are not necessary for the effective operation of the section.

In page 13, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"9.—Notwithstanding any other enactment, where a person has been convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a member of an Garda Síochána, he or she shall not be given preferential treatment while in the custody of the State.".There was extraordinary public disquiet at the prospect of the early release of the killers of Jerry McCabe. There is a certain amount of concern and anger at the perception that these people are receiving special treatment and are doing soft time for the crimes they have committed. This amendment seeks to send out a clear message that those days are well and truly over and that such a situation will never recur. People who kill members of the Garda Síochána must not be treated differently, no matter what the circumstances.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The Minister is not accepting this amendment, which has nothing to do with this particular legislation. I appreciate why the amendment has been tabled, but it relates to a matter of policy that might arise for consideration in the context of prisons legislation or a criminal justice Bill. This amendment seeks to introduce a rule or legal principle on the treatment of convicted offenders. Clearly, however, the appropriate place for that is in parole or prisons legislation which deals with the detention and treatment of offenders. The matter is not appropriate to the Bill before the House.Naturally, everyone on all sides of the House wants to see the life and personal integrity of every member of an Garda Síochána being respected. That is not in dispute. The Minister wishes to record the fact that the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe will serve their sentences. The area in which they have been detained, since 1999, is an open area of Castlerea prison. The Minister wishes to make it clear that under no circumstances could it be described as living in luxury. These prisoners and others, including other persons with convictions for rape and murder, are under no illusion but that they are in prison and that they will remain there for the duration of their sentences.They also know that the Minister will not hesitate to return them to Portlaoise Prison if that was warranted by any behaviour on their part. The Minister wishes to refute most emphatically any idea that persons in this category have received, or will receive, preferential treatment.

In page 13, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"(2) The appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be merit-based, and subject to a transparent public recruitment process.(3) The appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be subject to ratification by Bord an Gharda Síochána.".Is é an fáth gur chuir mé an leasú seo síos ná go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh déanamh cinnte de go roghnaítear daoine do na postanna tábhachtacha seo ar bhonn córais oscailte. Is oth liom nár glacadh leis an leasú, mar luaigh mé bord an Gharda Síochána. Glacadh le leasú eile de mo chuid a luaigh bord an Gharda Síochána, ach rialaíodh an ceann sin as ord. Tugann sé seo an deis dom míniú cad é bord an Gharda Síochána agus cad a bhí i gceist agam. Ní bhfuair mé an deis roimh ré.Má tá muid chun glacadh leis an leasú seo, caithfidh muid an míniú sin a thabhairt. Ba é an rud a bhí i gceist ná go ndéanfaí cinnte de go gcruthófaí bord neamhspleách saoránach do phóilíneacht ar bhonn reachtúil. Bheadh an bord sin ag feidhmiú mar chomhlacht saoránach ar a mbeadh freagracht Choimisinéar an Gharda. Comhlíonfaidh sé gné eile den chúram a bhí molta d'fhoireann cigireachta. Cuirfidh sé maoirseacht bainistíochta ar fáil ar ábhair mar earcaíocht, cáilíochtaí, caighdeán oiliúna, treallamh, lóistín, eagrú, modhanna agus sárchleachtadh. Nuair a chuir muid an achainí os comhair an Aire i Samhain 2003, nuair a lorg sé aighneachtaíón phobal i leith Bhille an Gharda Síochána, dúirt muid gur chóir go mbeadh bord póilíneachta ann a bheadh neamhspleách ar bhainistíocht na ngardaí, go mbeadh sé ionadaíoch, go mbeadh an próiseas ceapacháin trédhearcach, bunaithe ar fhiúntas agus neamhspleách ar na gardaí. Tá sé sa leasú seo, áit ar leag muid síos that the appointment be merit-based and subject to a transparent public recruitment process.Lean muid ar aghaidh á rá gur cheart go gceapfaí na gardaí sinsireacha ar bhonn an phróisis seo. Bheadh cruinnithe poiblí míosúla ann le Coimisinéar an Gharda chun tuairiscí a fháil ar an bhainistíocht. Mhol muid cumhachtaí eile don bhord póilíneachta. Le déanamh cinnte de go mbeadh an bord trédhearcach ó thús, dá mbeimis ag toghú Choimisinéar an Gharda nó Leas-Choimisinéar, ba cheart dóibh tuiscint go díreach cad atá i gceist anseo.Sin cuid den mheascán de ghnéithe éagsúla a bhíá gcur chun cinn againn san achainí a dhein muid agus sa pholasaí a chuir muid os comhair an Aire.I proposed initially the establishment of bord an Gharda Síochána and that the members of the board would be nominated by the Minister, following a transparent public recruitment process based on published criteria. I went further in that I wanted to ensure the appointment of the deputy Garda commissioner and the assistant Garda commissioner would be merit-based, rather than that they be appointed because they knew somebody, did somebody a favour or had been around for a long time. That is the reason for this amendment. I include the caveat that not only should they be appointed on the basis proposed in the amendment, but that the board should have a final say and the appointment should be subject to ratification by the board.I will explain how the board we suggested would be selected. It was intended that members of the board would be nominated by the Minister, following a transparent public recruitment process based on published criteria, where the Minister was satisfied the proposed members of the board had appropriate expertise, qualifications, training or experience, and in accordance with a series of subsections. It was proposed that no fewer than one third of the members of such a board would be cross-party public representatives, no fewer than one third would be representative of statutory agencies and no fewer than one third would be representative of the community and voluntary sector. I proposed also that no fewer than 50% of the members of bord an Gharda Síochána would be women.I proposed that nominations to the board should be made on the basis of positive action, with a view to ensuring the membership would be diverse and as representative as possible of all sections of society, including and in particular, working-class people, ethnic minorities, Travellers, people with disabilities and lesbian, gay and bisexual people. I also proposed that the chairperson of the board should be nominated and elected by its members and that the elected representatives should not be eligible to hold the chair. My proposal is not entirely unlike the Minister's proposed inspectorate under Part 5 or not entirely unlike Deputy Costello's proposal for a police authority.The proposed purpose of bord an Gharda Síochána would be to provide civilian management oversight with regard to recruitment qualifications, training standards, equipment, accommodation, distribution, organisation, methods, procedures and practices of an Garda Síochána. It would not only support the desire to achieve and practise international best standards of efficiency and effectiveness, but would foster public confidence in the service.I intended to require by statute that the members of bord an Gharda Síochána should familiarise themselves with international best practice, including human rights standards on policing. This ties in with the need for the appointment to the high office positions of deputy Garda commissioner and assistant Garda commissioner to be merit-based. Those who go forward for selection should be familiar with international best practice so they could work with the members of the board and ensure that best standards in policing were maintained.I wanted the board to have the power to appoint members of the Garda Síochána to senior ranks and made this proposal in subsection (3) of my amendment. This would be on the basis of the same transparent process. The board would review their performance and hold them accountable for their action or inaction. In contrast to the Minister's proposals, I wanted this board to meet monthly and in public and that the Garda Commissioner should be present for at least part of each meeting to present a report or reports and answer questions from members of the board. In that context, the chair of the board would present the formal report to the Garda Commissioner on behalf of bord an Gharda Síochána as necessary. Copies of such reports would also be provided to the Minister.I intended that the members of bord an Gharda Síochána would have the opportunity and responsibility to question the Garda Commissioner, to communicate concerns and priorities to him or her, and to make recommendations as necessary. I also proposed that the Garda Commissioner should be required to make available all information requested by bord an Gharda Síochána, unless the members agreed that it was clearly in the public interest to withhold such information on the basis of a serious threat to public security or safety, the safety of an individual or the need to refrain from jeopardising an investigation or prosecution. If the board considered that the terms of the test had not been met, I proposed that it could decide to hold certain sessions other than in public for the purpose of receiving information from the Garda Commissioner. The board would have to agree that to do so was necessary to safeguard the public from a serious threat to public security, public safety or the safety of an individual or to refrain from jeopardising an investigation or prosecution. I wanted to propose that the Garda Commissioner be required to provide an explanation for his or her decisions as well as the decisions and actions or inactions of those under his direction and control if requested by the proposed board to do so.I also wanted to propose that bord an Gharda Síochána be charged with agreeing short-term, medium-term and long-term strategic priorities and objectives for an Garda Síochána. I wanted to propose that the board be allowed to provide details of the priorities and objectives to the Minister, as part of the process of setting ministerial priorities and performance targets under section 19, and to the Garda Commissioner, as part of the process of agreeing strategy statements under section 20 or annual policing plans under section 21.Needless to say, I think the Minister should be required to consult a board like bord an Gharda Síochána and to have due regard to its views when he or she is setting priorities and performance targets for an Garda Síochána under section 19. Likewise, the Garda Commissioner should be required to consult such a board and have due regard to its views when he or she is formulating and implementing strategy statements under section 20 or annual policing plans under section 21.I wanted to propose that bord an Gharda Síochána be charged with monitoring the performance and budget management of the Garda against the priorities and performance targets drawn up under section 19, the strategy statements drawn up under section 20 and the annual policing plans drawn up under section 21. I intended to suggest that the board would monitor the performance and budget management of the Garda in the context of its own recommendations under the proposed section 119. It could also conduct such monitoring in light of any other indicators which it deems appropriate. I wanted to propose that the board could make recommendations to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, as appropriate, based on its assessment. Such recommendations could relate to resource allocations, policy change or change of practice. The Garda Commissioner and the Minister would be required to take due regard of such recommendations.It was my intention to propose that bord an Gharda Síochána be able to refer such matters as it deemed necessary and appropriate to the ombudsman of an Garda Síochána and to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I wanted to propose that the board be allowed to establish independent inquiries into certain matters, as it deemed appropriate, having due regard to the public interest.Finally, I wanted to propose in a spirit of accountability that bord an Gharda Síochána be required to publish an annual report. I proposed to require the board to furnish copies of the report to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to lay copies of it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.As I have said, it is a pity that my proposals in respect of bord an Gharda Síochána have not been taken on board to date. Even if my amendment No. 42 were accepted, the effect of it would be lost to a certain extent because the other amendments have been ruled out of order. I wanted to put amendment No. 42 in the context of the entire jigsaw into which it fits. I did not refer to bord an Gharda Síochána in the amendment without making provision for it elsewhere. It was a central part of the positive and well worked ideas I intended to propose to ensure that this Bill established a one-person Garda ombudsman as well as bord an Gharda Síochána which I have mentioned. I also proposed the establishment of community policing structures, known as páirtnéireachtaí póilíneachta phobail, on a lower level than the structures suggested by the Minister. The structures would be accountable to the communities in which gardaí would work.Most of my proposals were outlined in the submission Sinn Féin made to the Minister. I favour the introduction of community partnerships which are akin to the policing fora which have been established in recent years. Such fora have not been properly resourced and do not have the statutory basis they deserve. The community structures I proposed would be on a lower basis. There would be one community policing partnership in each police district. I do not agree with the Minister's suggestion that one partnership should serve an entire local authority area.Each of my proposals is a piece of the overall jigsaw. That the rest of my amendments have been ruled out of order does not mean that the Minister cannot take on board amendment No. 42, which proposes that: "The appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be merit-based, and subject to a transparent public recruitment process." I accept that the second part of the amendment would not have much meaning unless the Minister were to take on board all the other related amendments which have been ruled out of order.The full sense of my party's proposals in this regard can be gleaned if one examines amendment No. 1, which proposed a change to the Long Title of the Bill. That amendment recommended that the Bill should establish:THREE BODIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN AND CO-OPERATION WITH AN GARDA SÍOCHÁNA, INCLUDING A BODY TO BE KNOWN AS OMBUDSMAN AN GHARDA SÍOCHÁNA FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE GARDA SÍOCHÁNA, A BODY TO BE KNOWN AS BÓRD AN GHARDA SÍOCHÁNA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AN GARDA SÍOCHÁNA, AND BODIES TO BE KNOWN AS PÁIRTNÉIREACHTAÍ PÓILÍNEACHTA PHOBAIL, OR IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, COMMUNITY POLICING PARTNERSHIPS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOSTERING LOCAL CO-OPERATION AND HOLDING AN GARDA SÍOCHÁNA ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.It is a pity that the amendment, which outlined the various parts of the jigsaw, was not taken on board. Perhaps the House will be able to return to this matter to ensure that an Garda Síochána is accountable at the lowest possible level to the communities it serves. It is important that all communities feel they can play as big a role as possible in ensuring they are policed properly. Not only should an Garda Síochána be responsive to their needs, but they should also be responsive to the needs of an Garda Síochána when required.

His amendment No. 42 proposes that "the appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be merit-based, and subject to a transparent public recruitment process" and that "the appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be subject to ratification by Bord an Gharda Síochána". It is unfortunate that we will not have such a board.In an earlier amendment, I proposed the establishment of a Garda authority, similar to the board proposed by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Both of us favour the establishment of an oversight body that would ensure a level of accountability and transparency in all the functions of the Garda. Such a body would also be responsible for dealing with the force's promotional procedures. All these matters are inadequately addressed in the Bill before the House.I wish to speak about one of the core lacunae or flaws in the legislation. The Minister has chosen to hold the reins of the Garda Síochána and the Garda Commissioner close to his chest. The mechanisms provided for in the Bill are not sufficiently transparent or comprehensive to satisfy us that we have fulfilled the requirement to ensure that what has happened in the past will not happen again.Mr. Justice Morris has stated clearly that he is concerned about promotional matters. In his first report, he said that "the Tribunal regards with disquiet the promotion to senior ranks of persons who were unwilling or unable to give to their vocation the energy and aptitude that it demands". Mr. Justice Morris found that middle management members of the force — superintendents, inspectors and sergeants — in County Donegal were not conducting their duties with "energy and aptitude". There were people in the job who did not seem to have any commitment to it, nor any enthusiasm, energy or aptitude for it. This begs the question as to why they were in the job, how and why they were appointed and why they were left in it. Some of them have since retired and some are currently the subject of disciplinary action, but if the Morris tribunal had not been in place, those same people who allowed and supervised a conspiracy of criminality to be operated against vulnerable, innocent citizens to continue would still be there. What do we do in the legislation before us to redress that situation? We do nothing. The Minister has no new proposals to ensure that all promotions are transparent and independent and not merely at the behest of the Government.If we continue in this manner, we are not doing ourselves any favours today in the manner in which the legislation is being put forward. I would like to hear the Minister go into some detail about a merit-based and transparent public recruitment process. I know he believes, and has stated, that he already has this in place and that we will have one of the best, most transparent, merit-based recruitment processes possible. However, there is no structure to ensure that, and it will remain in the gift of the Government to make all the senior appointments.If we had put in place a Garda authority, one of its functions would have been to establish promotional procedures and ensure their implementation, and to ensure that recruitment took place in a transparent fashion. There is no doubt that the final ratification would come through the Government. However, there are currently officers in place who do not command the respect they should because of the use of the existing mechanism.The issue of accountability is not addressed in the legislation because we do not have the structures to address it. The Minister puts the emphasis on the persons, the role of the Garda Commissioner, the Minister and the inspectorate. This is not a satisfactory structure to ensure transparency. I hardly need remind the Minister of the criticism by Mr. Justice Morris with regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Minister, not knowing what was going on in the Garda Síochána. The Morris tribunal report arrived just a couple of weeks ago so we must take it that up to the present, the Minister, Ministers of State and the Department did not know what was going on in the Garda Síochána, that they simply take on trust whatever they are told. The Department is no wiser than the Minister, with the Garda Commissioner channelling information to the Minister, and there are no structures in place to check the validity or accuracy of what is being channelled.The Morris tribunal report determined that this was the fatal flaw in the chain of command, that there was no oversight, from the gardaí on the ground to the superiors in Donegal supposedly exercising a supervisory role, to the Garda management in headquarters in the Phoenix Park who should have been checking on everything and should have known what was going on, to the Department and the Minister. All along, there was a line of communication, but none of validation. That was missing.The Minister said that his line of validation will come through the inspectorate and the extra powers given to the Garda Commissioner. There is no hands-on structure there to allow oversight. An inspectorate will be hit and miss, and here and there. It will look at stations, it will be an audit mechanism, will perform different tasks given to it by the Minister and will report back to him. That is not the same as a transparent structure or one which will have the powers to ensure accountability and oversight.We need to look at the Garda operational strategy, budgeting, administration, reporting, annual plans and reports. Who will do all that? Will the Commissioner do it? I am not sure. It is doubtful if the Minister will do it, and the Department will not do it. The only check on all that is the Committee of Public Accounts. It will look at a narrow area of operation, the accounting and auditing section, at value for money. It will not have the broad spectrum of activities of the Garda under the microscope. It will be able to look at Garda operations perhaps only once a year. The inspection will not take place on an ongoing basis. There is no ongoing oversight or administration.

The legislation does not make it compulsory for the Garda Commissioner to appear. It puts no requirement on him to attend. We would expect the Commissioner to attend if and when requested, but the legislation does not give a specific role to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in terms of an oversight function regarding the operation of the Commissioner, the Minister or the Department. I would like the Minster to come back on that issue. He might consider an amendment which would give the committee the power referred to.The fatal flaw in the legislation is that nobody is responsible. Even if the committee had an oversight function, which it has in a general sense, it has so much else to do that it cannot have a day-to-day, week-to-week or month-to-month oversight function.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	872	A security committee does not exist though it might at some future time. Let us not talk of possibilities that may never be realised. In terms of oversight, I would love to see a specific role for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. That would be helpful. However, there is no substitute for a structure or mechanism to monitor all the activities going on.Deputy Ó Snodaigh emphasises in his amendment the need for a merit-based and transparent public recruitment process. Everybody recognises that need. The Minister must do a lot to convince us that the structure currently in operation with regard to Garda appointments above the rank of inspector is transparent and merit-based to an extent which commands public confidence. It is not, and it must be changed. The public must know that a proper structure is in place. I would like to ascertain what the Minister has in mind in that respect.The role of the ombudsman arises in the context of transparent structures. I look forward to the operation of the new commission in terms of transparency and effectiveness, given all our reservations to date. However, it is difficult to believe anything could be less effective than the current complaints machinery.The Minister has addressed a number of the issues in this regard but, ultimately, the Opposition is attempting to put the best and most effective structures, which will command respect, in place so we will not have to revisit the legislation in the autumn on the basis of it not working and that it was not thought out properly. I am not sure whether the ombudsman commission has the necessary powers because its ability to inspect Garda stations is a grey area. A number of stations can be inspected but others designated by the Minister will not be open to inspection.That presents an interesting conundrum. No Garda station deals wholly with security. A number of stations are concerned with the security of the State and documents and computer files are stored in them. The Commissioner will advise the Minister regarding the designation of stations on the basis that it would not be desirable to have the commission leafing through documents in them because of security concerns. Advance notice will be given of the visit of a member of the ombudsman commission. Once a station receives such a designation, advance notice is automatically provided and, therefore, it will be impossible for the commission to conduct its business properly.That presents a problem in terms of the powers of the commission. How many stations will be involved? Will the designation apply to part of the Garda station or aspects of the work engaged in by the station or will it apply to the entire station? What criteria will be used? What is "the security of the State"? Does it concern special branch, C3 files, matters relating to political or paramilitary activity or a combination? Limitations will be placed on the work of the commission. In which areas will it operate proactively without having to await a complaint? These issues relate to the transparency of the role of the ombudsman commission and the amendment is concerned with accountability, promotions and oversight and monitoring structures.My other amendment relating to the Garda authority will not give rise to a charge on the Exchequer. It states, "The Minister may by regulations provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Garda Síochána authority". That is not compulsory and an option will be provided. If it is only an option, why has the amendment been ruled out of order? The amendment under discussion presumes a Garda board will be in place, which will result in a cost to the State. There is a lack of logic about what is permissible and what is out of order. It would have been better if my more modest proposal had been used as the starting point. We could then have debated properly the other amendments, which lead from that proposal.The Opposition considers that a Garda authority should be established. It will not tie the Minister of the day in the manner the Minister thinks, thereby leaving nobody accountable to the House. The authority can be established in such a way that the Minister would remain accountable to the Oireachtas. The other side of the coin is the Minister will have sole responsibility for the Garda, which will be unhealthy. It will be impossible for a Minister to keep an eye on everything that happens and it will also be impossible for the Department to do so because it has different functions nor would it be healthy for the Department to do so. However, nothing will be established in their place, which is the problem.While the Minister points up the dangers to establishing an independent police authority, he has not proposed an effective body to replace it. The Minister has provided that the inspectorate and the Commissioner, through certain duties assigned to him or her, will take the place of such an authority but sufficient oversight capacity will not be provided. This will result in a mish mash down the line and the Garda not being subject to appropriate accountability or transparency. Neither will it be managed in an effective fashion on a day-to-day basis. A malaise could affect its operation in the future.We may have to revisit the amendments to the section. The Minister's amendments address matters raised in the Morris tribunal reports. However, the reports are not the be all and end all of Garda reform. The Patten report will have a greater contribution to make to such reform while Senator Maurice Hayes made a major contribution in this regard in the past. Other incidents in the not too distant past have raised concern about the need for Garda reform. Not only has confidence in the Garda been eroded following a major scandal in Donegal, it also has been eroded by the failure to deal with gangland killings.In those cases, people are operating with no chance of being prosecuted, convicted or imprisoned. In the past ten years, no more than two people have been convicted of gangland murders in any single year. In some years it was only one. When there are a dozen gangland murders and only one or two people are convicted for those crimes, it is not a high success rate. While it is notoriously difficult in international terms to achieve a high conviction rate in such cases, the low rate is worrying. People can virtually kill with impunity. Contract killers can be employed, and that is happening to a greater extent.The accompanying problem of where the guns are originating is a cause of equal public concern. They are readily available.

The gardaí do not appear to be able to deal with the weapons issue. The other side of the problem is drugs. The drugs problem has expanded across the country.There are many issues and community policing is a positive way of dealing with some of them. However, other areas of concern require a more structured response than is provided in this legislation. While we acknowledge the good provisions in the legislation, in a number of areas the Minister's response has been inadequate. It might be necessary to revisit the legislation. That is the reason the Minister should have taken on board some of the proposals we have put forward, including this one. It has been ruled out of order on the one hand and has been ruled in order on the other. Regardless of whether it is in order, it has enormous merit.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The point at issue is whether any body is responsible for oversight of the Garda Síochána and its functions. The Minister said the justice committee has a function in that regard. This was discussed on Committee Stage, when the Minister discovered that the justice committee had slightly more powers than he had realised. The chairman, Deputy Ardagh, pointed out that the terms of reference of the committee and Standing Orders allow the committee to call the Garda Commissioner before it.However, the justice committee has a heavy workload. It does valuable work, as was seen with its recent report on community policing, and there is a distinct possibility that it would be distracted and not do the oversight job comprehensively. For that reason the establishment of a security committee in this context is a necessity. The security committee could concentrate on the job, conduct the necessary oversight, examine the practical elements of the daily operation of the Garda Síochána and monitor the force carefully. If no other oversight body is to be provided, at least this would be of some assistance.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	876	I support amendment No. 42 on the two grounds outlined by the proposer. Transparency in the appointment of the deputy Garda commissioner, assistant Garda commissioner and the Garda Commissioner is long overdue. History shows that only two Garda Commissioners have ever been dismissed from office. One of them subsequently got involved in politics. While those who are appointed to the office of Garda Commissioner have the ability to perform their role and to perform it in an objective manner, as was the case with judicial appointments made in the past, the impression persists that being on the right side of the fence is the prime criterion as to whether they are appointed at a particular time to that position. A transparent procedure must be put in place to prevent those perceptions continuing into the future.There is a need for a body that would exercise that function and, indeed, other functions of accountability. Since being elected to this House in 2002 I have only once seen the Garda Commissioner appear before the justice committee. It was the previous Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne. I was asked to attend that meeting by the committee chairman to raise issues I had raised previously in the House when discussing justice legislation. I found the occasion most unsatisfactory. It was not an exercise in accountability. I considered it nothing less than an exercise in public relations on behalf of the then Commissioner and the Garda.If there is to be true accountability and if it is to be exercised through a committee of this House, stronger powers will be required. Those powers will have to be exercised in the same way as in other jurisdictions. We do not come even close to exercising the type of committee powers that can be exercised in the United States, for example. Until we are prepared to make parallel changes in our committee system, the issue of accountability, even after this Bill is enacted, will continue to be as nebulous as it has been throughout the history of the State. In passing this Bill on those terms we will not have done a good day's work.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The first issue I wish to comment on is how we select the top appointments in the Garda Síochána. Let us be blunt. Much of the criticism of the Garda Síochána is not concerned with the lower ranks but with management. The question is whether there is sufficient management expertise in the Garda Síochána. I am not pointing a finger at any individual at the top level of the Garda but at the general management approach. One must wonder how somebody who has come up through the police ranks would acquire the management skills required unless they have had the opportunity of acquiring those skills in modern management schools or outside the Garda Síochána.We must confront the issue of how to ensure that middle and top management of the Garda will have the best management skills. This issue has been avoided. On Committee Stage I suggested bringing civilians with management skills into the top levels of the Garda Síochána. I highlighted the case of the Minister's former special adviser who has become the head of public relations with the PSNI. I understand she holds the position and status of assistant chief constable. Despite being a civilian she has that seniority and status. Will we follow the same precedent? That is not to suggest that we slavishly follow everything that is done in Northern Ireland.In the early days of the Garda Síochána there was another precedent whereby people with a military background were brought into the force. I am not saying "yea" or "nay" to that practice. Management expertise is needed. Top people in the Garda Síochána might be given leave of absence for several years to enter management positions in the private sector to broaden their expertise and return with that into the force. We must be open to a new approach to management so that the best police force in the world about which I have spoken will be the best-managed police force in the world.Deputy Gerard Murphy touched on a point I have frequently raised and will raise again possibly for the last time in the context of this Bill, namely, an Oireachtas security committee to provide oversight. I take the Minister's formal response on that issue, that he is not responsible for setting up committees. However, external oversight is necessary.This committee should be outside the security loop of the Minister, the Department, the Garda headquarters and gardaí down the line. The Minister resolutely opposes a police authority and has argued his point on that. Whatever happens in the future we should put that external oversight in place through the Oireachtas. That is why I believe an Oireachtas security committee is necessary.It may be said that the Garda Commissioner may come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights but that committee is overloaded and could not cope with that responsibility. Alternatively, it may be argued that, under this new Bill, the Garda Commissioner will come before the Committee of Public Accounts as the Accounting Officer but that will be to deal only with accounts which is the role of that committee. I refer to operational matters, the type of issues on which, had there been oversight, we might have avoided many recent difficulties.The Garda Síochána should be the best police force in the world with the best resources possible but it should know that to a degree it is under the additional microscope of an Oireachtas security committee. This committee should be fully resourced, similar to the Committee of Public Accounts, with an Opposition chairman to ensure that it remains outside the loop I have described. It often seems that the Government chairman of an Oireachtas committee is the mouthpiece of a Minister. I do not say this particularly of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The chairman of a security committee must be a member of the Opposition.Can that security committee be set up as soon as the Bill is enacted? What needs to be done? I made my point and the Minister has agreed with me so it should not be left in limbo. Will a memorandum be sent to Government suggesting that it take the necessary steps in the House to put the arrangements in place?I agree with Deputy Costello that within two years of the implementation of this Bill an independent policing commission, similar to the Patten Commission, should be established. The Government rejected the proposal last night. Nevertheless, it would be useful that when the Act is in place, everyone involved, from the Minister through to the Garda Síochána, is aware an independent commission would take place in two years. That would help to keep everyone alert and, in addition to the immediate oversight of the proposed Oireachtas security committee, help to ensure that the aims of this Bill would be achieved.

In regard to subsection (2) and the appointment of the deputy and assistant Garda commissioners, it is important to appoint the right people to senior positions. The phrase "merit-based" is significant because there is an urgent need to give priority to the quality people already in the Garda Síochána who have proved to be effective officers. There should be no other method or procedure for appointments to the top level. Members of the public and gardaí sometimes feel there is no process to reward valuable members of the Garda Síochána.A transparent recruitment process is necessary to ensure that everyone concerned understands the procedures involved in the process. An opportunity exists to reform the Garda Síochána and develop it as a modern police force that meets international standards. Recent cases have damaged this debate which some might feel is a reaction to those events. There should be a constant process of change, development and progress in organisations such as the police force. Amendment No. 42 deals positively with this issue.Subsection (3) of the amendment, "The appointment of a Deputy Garda Commissioner and Assistant Garda Commissioner will be subject to ratification by Bord an Gharda Síochána", is also very constructive. The Minister should take on board the views of certain organisations, particularly in regard to the roles of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner. Some feel that the Bill runs the risk of over-centralising and politicising the Garda Síochána which would undermine its independence. The police should be and be seen to be of service to the public and not the tool of Government. It should be independent but also accountable as a servant of the State.We must recognise the need to introduce changes and reforms, and improve the integrity and quality of the Garda Síochána. This amendment is part of that process because it adds a new dimension to the legislation. There are people within the force who have much to contribute, through merit and a strong work record. I worked with some of them both as a city councillor and a primary school teacher in the north inner city.The greatest gap occurred in the 1980s at the time of the bad heroin epidemic in the north inner city when a group of young gardaí——

I wish to emphasise the message. Quality police officers working locally win the trust and support of communities, particularly in regard to serious issues. Subsection (3) of amendment No. 42 is part of the debate on bringing quality people into top management in the Garda Síochána.In the recruitment process people must also accept that there are challenges for the new deputy and assistant Garda commissioners. I would like to see those people take up the challenges in a very positive and constructive way. I would also like to see those senior gardaí linking up with other police forces internationally and dealing with examples of good practice in policing. There are some examples internationally of quality police officers, and I know that some of that already happens at some level. However, I would like to see it develop further because of the recent international situation, particularly regarding the drugs trade, which has a strong international dimension.Amendment No. 42 will improve the quality of life of the Garda Síochána and citizens as well as the service to the community. I urge all Deputies to support this important amendment.

I have never heard a coherent argument for it, although I have heard people come up with half-thought-out views on the subject.On the Order of Business — I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle was present — someone was giving out about the fact that he had tabled questions to the Minister for Health and Children and been told that they had been referred to the Health Service Executive for a response. There was an outraged squeak of horror from the Deputy, who realised that one of the difficulties of delegating an entire area of governmental activity to an agency other than the Minister is that one is suddenly confronted with a situation where the Minister can say that she is sorry but that there is a group of people known as the board of the HSE. There is a chief executive officer, Professor Brendan Drumm, and Deputies must address questions to the executive rather than to the Minister. They make the decisions, and the Minister gives them the money, directives and policy. Thereafter, it is up to them to come up with explanations.The same emphatically applies to the question of policing. Deputy Finian McGrath, whose contribution I listened to very intently, put his finger on it, although not in a way with which I would agree, when he said that the police cannot be seen as a tool of the Government. I do not agree with that proposition at all. In our Constitution, there are three arms of State, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The Executive arm of the State is most certainly responsible for its policing. It is responsible through this Parliament and its elected Members to the people. That is what the Constitution envisages.It would be a very sad day if policing were carried out in this State in a way in which no one on these benches was personally and politically accountable to this Chamber, and the relationship between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda was as close as that between the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the staff of "Morning Ireland" at RTE.

Deputies should not ask the Minister why some journalist, commentator or presenter is biased or being overpaid since that is a matter for the RTE authority. That is what happens when we establish bodies not subject to ministerial authority and accountability.The fundamental intellectual flaw that the Members opposite have continually exhibited in this debate is a radical inability to distinguish between operational independence, which we all accord to the Garda Síochána — when its members carry out their duties, they are supposed to do it themselves — and accountability. The two are not mutually exclusive.One can say to the Commissioner, his deputy and assistant commissioners and the entire pyramid of authority in the Garda Síochána down to the men and women who serve as gardaí that they are operationally independent as a force. The Minister will not tell them from day to day where they should deploy their forces, how they should enforce the speed limit, whether they should put people out on shifts at 3 a.m. or work three equal eight-hour shifts. One can say all those things by endorsing the principle of operational independence and saying to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that he is Accounting Officer and that he should take part in value-for-money discussions with the Committee of Public Accounts to justify what he is doing with the resources deployed in the force. One can say all those things but certainly one cannot say that the Garda Síochána should be an unaccountable force.People keep arguing that if there were an independent police authority, the Garda would be accountable to it. However, let us consider what there is in Northern Ireland where the police authority consists of two groups of people married together. On the one hand, there are the great and the good selected by the Northern Ireland Office and, on the other, there is a group of politicians chosen on the d'Hondt principle. That amalgamated body runs the Police Service of Northern Ireland.Imagine if we had that here, if the Government selected eight people and Members of the Oireachtas had some kind of mini-Seanad election and selected the remainder. What accountability would I have if such a group were running the Garda Síochána? What criticism could be made of me for the state of management or otherwise of the Garda Síochána if such a wonderful group were put in charge of our police? How would I be to blame if the rate of arrests or detections declined? What would the Deputy say to me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the state of the police if such a group existed and ran the Garda Síochána from day to day, demanding accountability from the Commissioner? It simply does not add up. Frankly, the more that I think about it, the more that one thing in this debate——

How come, when it was one of the programme for Government commitments of the 1982 to 1987 Fine Gael-Labour Government to establish an independent police authority, that did not happen during those five years when very eminent members of Fine Gael such as Deputy Noonan and Alan Dukes served as Minister for Justice?

One would have the bland old response that the crime or homicide rate was rising and that we really must do something about it, such as sending a letter to the independent police authority and telling it to pull its socks up. That is the kind of politics for which the Deputies opposite are collectively arguing. It is the most threadbare policy that I have ever heard articulated in this House. The more I have heard people suggesting it and the stronger the condemnation of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I in regard to recent events, it has become crystal clear that this is all guff and there is not a case for an independent police authority.

They do not want, under the circumstances, to give up the notion of ministerial accountability, but they wish to divest the Minister of any real authority in the matter and to give it to a group of the great and the good who would carry out this function.That is the real problem with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment No. 42. It is predicated on the establishment of bord an Gharda Síochána to act as an independent police authority.

I am the first Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring before this House a new independent promotions system for every rank in the Garda Síochána. I have been struck by the constant barrage from those who talk about patronage, unfair promotion and so on in the Garda Síochána. There are two species of this line of argument. The first is the contention that it is all based on party politics. It has been argued in this House that the Garda is politically divided and that its internal management is somehow imbued with party politics. The second position is perhaps slightly more credible in its contention that there are internal Garda politics involved in the promotion system and that this is obnoxious and reprehensible.

I have been Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for three years.

This Bill puts in place for the first time ever — I say this to all the Deputies who have been in office and have not delivered — a system under which there will be an independent promotion board of which the majority of members will not be gardaí and will be selected from panels appointed not by the Commissioner but by the Government.

This is totally false. The only sense in which it is true that superintendent or chief superintendents are appointed by the Government is that they are appointed at the end of a merit-based process and that the Government invariably accepts the name of the person who is at the top of the list.

When people are promoted on that basis, the pertinent point about the fact that they hold office from the Government is that this gives them strength in their role in that they cannot be sidelined, pushed aside or demoted because they hold their commission, like Army officers, from the Government. They are people who have a direct relationship with the Government.The selection of a Commissioner, as with the appointment under the TLAC system of a Secretary General of a Department, must ultimately fall to the Government. It would be an abdication of the responsibility of Government to say that some other group of the great and good should say who the Commissioner or his or her deputies should be. That would be a hopeless abdication of the function of Government. I strongly believe we should stick closely to the position that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as the member of the Government with special responsibility in this area, is accountable to this House for the conduct of the Garda Síochána. We should not adopt this woolly-minded approach which argues there is some type of middle way whereby a group of people can perform the same function in regard to the Garda Síochána as the RTE authority does for RTE. That is a mistaken view of democracy and is wholly misconceived.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	954	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me, in partnership with my colleague, Deputy Crowe, to raise this issue. As two Tallaght-based Deputies, we are deeply concerned about the situation whereby 28 employees of the Tallaght community development initiative, on the job initiative scheme, have been given notice that their contracts of employment will be terminated on 1 July next.After the excitement of the day one would expect some of us to be calm, and I will be as calm as I can, but at the same time, I must admit to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, whom I welcome, that I am particularly agitated about this issue. It is a blow for Tallaght and although I do not want to exaggerate the issue, it has been brewing for some time. The 28 job initiative scheme workers employed by Tallaght community development initiative are involved in a number of important projects in the Tallaght area, dealing with disadvantage and other issues. A number of them are in the RAPID area.To give the Minister of State a flavour of these projects, they include the Tallaght Travellers' homework project, the Swan family centre based in Alderwood in Springfield, St. Kevin's resource centre in Kilnamanagh, Firhouse parish centre, the citizens' information centre, which launched a new booklet in Tallaght yesterday, the Kilinarden community centre, St. Mailruan's intercultural drop-in centre in the village, the community forum and Brittas national school.One can see these projects are very dependent on the job initiative scheme. They have been successful, adding to services in Tallaght and providing tremendous facilities. The workers were completely shocked when out of the blue on Monday last they got notice that their employment was to be terminated. This must be taken in the context that both I and Deputy Crowe have been told that other sponsors are available and have confirmed to FÁS that they can take on the workers.There are other projects that will facilitate these workers.This is a case of FÁS bureaucracy running amok. I depend on the Minister of State to sort out this matter for us. I appeal to him to get involved. I acknowledge the interest the Minister of State has shown since we brought the matter to his attention yesterday. I acknowledge also the interest of the Minister and the Department officials who have been in touch with us. Somebody has to sort out the FÁS management and bureaucracy. It should be made clear to the management that Tallaght is not prepared to stand idly by and let 28 important JI jobs be lost. The projects would suffer hugely and the infrastructure in Tallaght would be at a loss. Ministerial intervention is vital in this case. I do not want to tell the Minister of State what to do but FÁS management should be summoned tomorrow morning and the Department should make it clear that this can be sorted out. I do not want to be here next week lamenting the loss of these jobs and trying to raise the matter in another way. The solution is obvious. It is clear from the information made available to us that other projects are in place that can cater for this situation.I ask the Minister of State to pay special attention to this matter and intervene. These are important projects. A number of them are in RAPID areas, which I understood would be guaranteed. I am making a special appeal to the Minister of State and I hope he will accept the points I have made to him and save these 28 JI jobs in Tallaght.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	955	Will the Minister of State accept the importance of the projects my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, has outlined? I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of these different projects to the community in the greater Tallaght area, some of which extend into Brittas. They are all doing vital work. I described this announcement as a body blow to the communities and community groups in those areas. Many of them will do vital work with young children in the area over the summer months. Groups like Tallaght Citizens' Information Service provide information on social welfare problems and so on. People use that service constantly but it is due to lose some of its people. Deputy O'Connor spoke about the important work the Tallaght Travellers homework project is doing with the homework clubs and so on. This announcement appears to be a contradiction in that respect. The Minister of State will be aware that the education committee has discussed the problem of disadvantage and the importance of giving young people an opportunity to break out of the cycle of poverty and disadvantage. There are people working in those areas.This is an unusual situation in that the TCDI board resigned en masse and we are told the jobs will be terminated from 1 July. We are being told by FÁS that there is no official policy in place to account for the JI managing agents terminating their work. There is a contradiction here, and it struck me when talking to people about this matter, in that we had a statement from the Minister, Deputy Martin, on 10 November 2004, the headline of which read: “Martin Introduces Changes to FÁS Employment Scheme.” He said there would be no compulsory lay-offs yet 28 people are facing redundancy. All the staff have been asked by FÁS if they want to take redundancy. We are told constantly that these people do not want to work but they want to work in their communities, and they are doing vital work. No one wants to accept the lay-offs.I thought the uncertainty around this issue had been addressed following the statement from the Minister, Deputy Martin. Why is this situation happening? Will the uncertainty around the JI, community employment and the social economy programmes be raised again? Last year, Members from all parties in this House raised the issue of these programmes being terminated and the effect of that on communities, particularly disadvantaged communities. There is a contradiction in this situation because the Government statement was to the effect that it was concerned about disadvantage yet it allowed these cutbacks in the area.I do not know whether what has happened is a blip in the system but we want to know the position. I realise the Minister will read from a script when replying but I hope it will not be the usual type of reply to the effect that the matter is being examined and so on. We want answers here tonight. If that is not possible, we are asking the Minister of State and his Department to resolve this situation sooner rather than later and before these jobs are lost because it will have enormous effect on the people living in those communities, not just on the families of the people working in JI schemes.This is a body blow to the people in Tallaght. There is an opportunity, even at this late stage, to resolve this matter. Why can the people on these schemes not be transferred to another sponsoring agency? That is the important question. If mechanisms or structures have to be put in place to allow that to happen, I ask the Minister of State to put those structures in place and not allow this action be mirrored in other communities throughout the State because that is what will happen. FÁS appears to be taking a strong line on this issue. We are all looking for compromise, which can resolve the situation. I hope the Minister of State and his Department can resolve it.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	956	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue on the Adjournment.The active labour market programmes undertaken by FÁS comprise job initiative, community employment and the social economy programme. Between them these programmes provide about 25,000 places. The vast majority of participants, in the order of 21,600, are on community employment.Job Initiative is an active labour market programme aimed specifically at those over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for the previous five years. Participants are employed on a full-time basis. In the region of 1,900 participants are currently employed on JI.The programme was introduced as a pilot programme in 1996-97 with 1,000 places available. It operated as a three-year work experience programme with the objective of progressing its participants into jobs in the open labour market. The allocation of places to individual projects is an administrative matter for FÁS. Currently, local managing agents manage Job Initiative projects, usually at partnership level. These managing agents are legally and administratively the employers of the participants in the JI context.There was extensive consultation with the social partners and key stakeholders last year on the future direction of FÁS labour market programmes. Following the conclusion of the review process, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, announced that with effect from 10 November 2004 there would be no compulsory lay-offs on JI. Participants employed on the programme would have their contracts renewed for a further term. In circumstances where people leave JI voluntarily, the community organisations may replace them with CE participants. These arrangements are intended to ensure the maintenance of the provision of a network of valuable community services throughout the country.It is intended that available resources will fund additional community employment positions and other improvements to the programme, which it is believed will provide better outcomes for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. The CE programme is currently being restructured by FÁS to better meet the needs of the individual participants. The new approach will include a new application and assessment process for CE sponsors and an individual learner plan for participants.I am informed by FÁS that the Tallaght Community Development Initiative, which is the managing agent on behalf of FÁS, does not wish to continue to manage the project and that the TCDI itself — and I stress this point — has decided on its own initiative to disband the company with effect from Friday, 1 July 2005. This was not a decision taken by FÁS. Furthermore, I am informed by FÁS that it was only informed of this decision on Monday, 20 June 2005. In the meantime, FÁS is using every effort in seeking out other placement possibilities for the JI supported workers and the continuation of the services provided by the company. FÁS has already met representatives of the managing agent and further meetings are planned to discuss a way forward. I have asked FÁS to keep me informed of developments.I would point out that Exchequer funding is providing more than 25,000 places on FÁS employment programmes this year at a cost in the region of €368 million, of which €293 million is in respect of CE.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	957	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, be allowed to remain open. The closure of this facility would result in a loss of jobs in the region which would have direct impact on counties Sligo and Leitrim. The prison facility, which has been open since 1972, remains one of the most efficiently run prisons while providing a high quality service and standard of care and rehabilitation, which I witnessed on a visit to the Loughan House facility. Despite this, Loughan House is due for closure this autumn.It has been well documented in recent years that the Prison Service faces a real crisis. Closing one of the success stories is not the answer. The prison inspector, Mr. Justice Kinlen, was highly complimentary of the management and quality care that Loughan House provides. It provides an open setting which is difficult to maintain, yet the prison officers do a fantastic job at enforcing discipline, rehabilitating inmates and keeping order.The Government is trying to sell the idea of decentralisation. Closing Loughan House flies in the face of this. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has been quoted as wanting to create more quality time for families of prison officers by allowing them to spend more time at home. However, if Loughan House closes, prison officers and their families will be decentralised from their home base throughout the country.If there were arguments for the closure of the prison on the basis of malfunction, scandal, lack of care, budgetary extravagance or such like, there would be a logical reason for action. However, the Committee of Public Accounts recently heard that the Loughan House facility gave good value for money with regard to location and suitability for the rehabilitation of prisoners. There is no reason for the closure. The prison officers at Loughan House have endured working overtime without payment and facilitated cost-cutting by engaging in voluntary staff rescheduling, agreeing transfers to Castlerea Prison when it opened as well as accepting a total restructuring of the prison to ensure its efficiency would be paramount. The officers have also worked out an agreement with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform whereby they would work with a maximum of 50 inmates after the appropriate number of staff had transferred.The closure would be a travesty and a scandal of the highest order in a Border region. We will not stand idly by and let it happen. I have experience of the facility and the dedication and commitment of its staff to the rehabilitation of inmates. It is basically an open prison. Given that the Minister intends to spend €130 million on a relocation in Dublin, the closure would be outrageous. In the past year and a half, a considerable amount of taxpayers' money has been invested in Loughan House.It is extraordinary that the Minister has sounded the death knell for Loughan House and indicated it will close by autumn of this year. I appeal to him. This is a critical investment in a Border county and its closure would give all the wrong signals. At a time when decentralisation is being discussed, we have a committed staff who are prepared to work the roster and give value for money.There was significant debate at the Committee of Public Accounts about prison overtime. The officers have agreed to facilitate this and work with the Minister to ensure there will be value for money. I hope he has positive news for all concerned, prisoners as well as staff. Prisoners also enjoy the facility which has rehabilitated many of them. Staff have given the commitment to work in this centre to ensure its viability. I hope the Minister can tell the House the proposed closure this autumn will not happen.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	958	I make this reply to Deputy Perry on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I am grateful to the Deputy for raising the matter. The Deputy will be aware a programme of change for the Prison Service, which was the subject of intensive discussions with the Prison Officers Association over the past four years, came to a conclusion in April when prison staff rejected a comprehensive and generous package of proposals at ballot. The Deputy will also be aware that the future of Loughan House and the other open centre at Shelton Abbey is inextricably linked to this development.The implications for Loughan House and Shelton Abbey of failure to reach agreement on essential change in the Prison Service have been well known since November 2003. At that time, the Government approved a range of alternative measures for achieving cost efficiencies in the service, including the transformation of the two Prison Service open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into half-way houses under the aegis of another organisation.The simple fact is that the Minister engaged in a process with the Prison Officers Association on a partnership basis over a lengthy period with a view to effecting change across the service which would be beneficial to both management and staff while at the same time addressing the chronic overtime problem which has dogged the service across the lifetimes of several Governments. The Minister has been exceptionally patient throughout this process. Since he took office in 2002, he has allowed ample space and time for a mutually acceptable negotiated settlement to be reached between the Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association.Following on the rejection of the earlier offer in October 2003, the Minister agreed to use the full range of industrial relations machinery available in the State, including the conciliation services of the Labour Relations Commission and the ultimate arbitration facilities of the Civil Service Arbitration Board. That process continued over a 16-month period. It involved long and difficult negotiations leading to a substantial arbitration award.Despite reservations which the Minister held about the deal that emerged, which were shared by the Minister for Finance and the rest of his colleagues in Government, he nevertheless accepted that the overall package represented a workable way forward for the future. However, prison officers made their position very clear when they rejected the deal by a very significant margin, despite the fact that the full range of industrial relations machinery had been utilised to the full, including the ultimate step of arbitration, and despite the deal being wholeheartedly endorsed by the Prison Officers Association national executive.By any standards, the deal on offer can only be viewed as very attractive. It included a pensionable operational allowance equivalent to 8% of basic pay and lump sum payments amounting to €13,750 per officer in return for the level of change envisaged. Under the deal, a basic grade prison officer would have potentially earned almost €70,000 per year at the top of the scale. The main benefit to the taxpayer would have been a significant reduction in the bill for additional hours working in the Prison Service, predictable future costs and a more efficient service for the future. At the same time, staff would have secured attractive, stable and predictable overall rates of remuneration.The Minister never made a secret of the consequences of failure to reach an agreement and they will come as no surprise to prison staff. The Minister is left with no option but to proceed immediately with the agenda already approved by Government to ensure the Prison Service is run as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. That agenda is now in place and steps to implement it are already under way.The Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention are now closed and will not reopen. All the staff from those institutions have been reassigned to other institutions. The two Prison Service open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey will cease to function in due course and halfway houses under the management of another organisation will be put in place at both locations. A prior indicative notice has already been published in the EU Journal so the time needed to complete the tendering process can be minimised. Staff serving in these institutions will be redeployed permanently to other institutions.Legislation to outsource the prisoner escort service, which has already been approved by Government, was published recently and will be enacted without delay. Arrangements to invite tenders for outsourcing of this service will proceed in parallel. This has already begun with the publication in the EU Journal of a prior indicative notice. It is expected, following this process, that a contract will be signed by the end of September. This will have a major impact on overtime expenditure in the Prison Service given that 30% of all overtime earnings is attributable to prisoner escorts.Measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service through the use of new technology such as CCTV, automated gates, cellular vans and video links will be rolled out as a matter of priority. Work in this regard is already well advanced. In the meantime, the Minister instructed the Prison Service to apply strict monthly overtime budgets in each institution which will be rigidly controlled. He has already met prison governors and given them specific instructions in that regard.As regards the current state of play, the position, following on the rejection of the proposal for organisational change by prison staff, is that the Prison Officers Association sought a meeting with the Minister at which it indicated that the proposal might have been accepted had the banding arrangements for the working of additional hours been different. It was suggested that the bands could be re-jigged in a cost neutral fashion so more staff could opt out of additional hours and more staff could opt to work a higher number of hours. The Minister indicated it was open to the Prison Officers Association to make whatever submissions it might wish to make in that regard but it needed to be clearly understood he was not in the business of renegotiating the proposal for organisational change which has already been arbitrated upon by the Civil Service Arbitration Board. He made clear he was not prepared to compromise the integrity of the industrial relations machinery which has served the State so well and must continue to serve our public services into the future. The Prison Officers Association submitted proposals for the realignment of the additional hours bands. Having considered these proposals, the Minister was satisfied that they would fundamentally alter the deal that was on the table and would seriously compromise the integrity of the industrial relations machinery, in particular the arbitration process. In these circumstances, he had no option but to indicate to the Prison Officers Association that its proposals were totally unacceptable. In this context, the director general of the Irish prison service issued to it a letter to that effect last Friday, 17 June 2005. That is the position as it stands.The Minister has gone as far as he can with this process. The end of the line has been reached in terms of discussions on the proposal and the Minister will not be led down the path of renegotiation. It is regrettable that the considered and painstakingly developed approach negotiated over such a long period may not now be realised. The Minister's preference has always been for an agreed way forward. He has no option now but to move ahead, with or without agreement, to implement whatever other measures are required to realise the necessary cost efficiencies with all due urgency.The Minister points out that the director general of the prison service indicated to the Prison Officers Association in the letter that issued on 17 June that it might be useful for it to meet the Minister in order that he might clarify his intentions. To date the Prison Officers Association has not responded to this letter, although the Minister is expecting a response within the next few days.Concerning Loughan House, were the Minister to implement his current stated position, the facility would continue to be used.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	959	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise the circumstances in which the Bris project in the Westside part of Galway city, part of the diversion programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was terminated; the manner in which the programme was terminated; such plans as exist for the resumption of the project and the timescale for such, given that a number of activities had been planned for the participants during the summer period.Bris was one of 64 projects that are part of a diversion programme which is very successful. Perhaps more than 88% of participants do not end up in juvenile crime statistics. Therefore, it was a great shock to find that this project, which had been working very successfully, was terminated. At one time it dealt with 100 youths and this figure fluctuated down as far as 42.On 31 May it was suggested that the sponsoring organisation Le Chéile, which undertook the management of the project, was to be replaced by the Galway Youth Federation. On the occasion of the supposed handing over from one management group to another, six gardaí, a Garda inspector and others arrived and proceeded to remove files, computers and other material from the project offices. This has led to a serious situation concerning the interpretation of this action, the manner in which it was executed and how it affects the permanent worker, who had such a good relationship with the families and the young people involved.I live near this area and have visited this project. I am very familiar with it. The young people were due to take part in a five-a-side soccer tournament, sailing classes had been organised and now there is nothing. If I inquire I can be told that these young people have not fallen out of the concern of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that the gardaí are in touch with those who are young offenders. The Bris project was concerned not just with those referred as young offenders but also those who were at risk. That is the essence of the project.What happens now? Why was an alternative sponsoring organisation not found? Why was alternative management not investigated? Who was consulted? Was the city council consulted? It was involved at one stage and paid the salary of a second worker on the project. The parents and those who live on the local authority estates all around that area have signed a petition asking that the project be restored. There is no information available as to whether it will be restored.There are successful diversion programmes run, for example, by Foróige in Ballybane and Knocknacarra in the north part of the city. Was Foróige asked if it could extend its resources to step in where Le Chéile stepped out? What was the arrangement with Le Chéile? What was the basis for the sudden departure of one group of people and what was the basis for accepting that another group was willing? I understand that after 31 May a letter was produced suggesting that the Galway Youth Federation was now not proceeding.The net effect is that young people and families have been left at risk and are not being provided for. It is an appalling consequence. I hope another group can be invited as an interim measure. Could the liaison service have run the projects? Could a co-operative have been established? There were volunteers — successful people from very deprived backgrounds who had come to this project with serious problems, some of whom had made it all the way through the third level system. They now have nothing to volunteer their services to, the children have nowhere to come, the parents have nothing to send their children to and the entire community has suffered.Around midday, six gardaí, a Garda inspector and others arrived and began moving equipment. The professional full-time worker there had long experience of working in youth work and had a MSc in sociology and youth work from Swansea University. He was not told what was happening, he was simply told he no longer had a job.I ask the Minister to answer these questions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	960	I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I agree with him that the diversion projects are an important and useful part of our juvenile justice system. In fact, I appointed a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the diversion programmes, which has now reported. I will publish that report in the next few weeks. One of the features it establishes is that the Deputy is quite correct in stating that the diversion programmes are very successful in diverting a large number of youths from the offending path.As the Deputy is aware, the Garda youth diversion projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which seek to divert young people from becoming involved or further involved in anti-social or criminal behaviour. The projects provide suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve the prospects of employment. The projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing the relationship between the Garda Síochána and local communities. The projects are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and administered by the community relations section of the Garda Síochána. The Minister and I are committed to their continuing development and also, as resources permit, to their expansion.The first projects, originally known as Garda special projects, were established in 1991 following a sudden outbreak of lawlessness in a number of communities which resulted in street violence and public order offences, including the unauthorised taking of cars. These offences were committed mainly by young people and occurred in communities that faced many problems. By October 2001, the number of projects had reached the existing level of 64. Many of the projects established in recent years were facilitated by the allocation of funding under the national development plan.The rapid expansion in project numbers created quality assurance challenges to the operation and management of the projects. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned an evaluation report on the Garda youth diversion projects, which suggested that a set of guidelines was required to develop a planned and strategic approach. As a result, in 2001 the Department commissioned the centre for social and educational research at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Rathmines, to prepare comprehensive guidelines which were launched by the Minister in May 2003. The guidelines set out best practice for the establishment, operation, administration and monitoring of projects and best practice concerning preventative activities and interventions in dealing with marginalised young people.The Garda youth diversion projects are established by the Garda Síochána following a process of consultation with local community interests and youth service providers. Projects are established in response to local crime problems with the objective of giving local communities some degree of ownership in tackling the problems faced by their areas. The management committees are representative of the various interests involved. Participation in the projects is voluntary.The primary project target group, which forms the majority of project participants, comprises young people who have entered the Garda juvenile diversion programme and are considered at risk of remaining within the justice system. A secondary project target group comprises young persons who, although they have not been officially cautioned, have come to the attention of the Garda Síochána, the community or local agencies as a result of their behaviour and are considered at risk of entering the justice system at a future date.The number of participants in each project differs according to local circumstances and resources. It is estimated that the 64 Garda youth diversion projects cater for approximately 3,150 persons in the current year. The young people involved, as well as their parents, community members, local gardaí and project co-ordinators, are overwhelmingly of the view that the projects are beneficial.Funding of €5.471 million has been allocated to Garda youth diversion projects this year. Up to recently, there were three projects operating in County Galway: the Junction project in Ballinasloe; the Bris project — to which the Deputy referred — in Galway city; and the Bán project in Ballybane. The Bris project commenced in May 2001.Le Chéile, already referred to by the Deputy, is a voluntary organisation situated in Galway which agreed to become the employer of the project staff. It was responsible for all issues regarding contract of employment, salary and line management. The activities of the project were overseen by a project committee made up of representatives of Le Chéile, the Garda Síochána, Galway City Council, local clergy and the local vocational education committee. A total of €75,374 was allocated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the project for this year.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that the Bris Garda youth diversion project terminated on 31 May 2005, following the withdrawal of service by the employer of the project staff, Le Chéile.

This property has been taken into Garda custody and all public funds unspent are under the control of the Garda Síochána.It is anticipated that the project will be evaluated in accordance with the guidelines in the near future. Following this evaluation, a decision will be made on the feasibility of starting a new project under the Garda youth diversion project guidelines. As Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with responsibility for juvenile justice, I will raise this matter in the Department and will take a personal interest in it.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	964	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that as of 21 June 2005 there were 86 juvenile liaison officers, JLO, gardaí and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country. In addition to this the National Juvenile Office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants. The administration in the office is carried out by these two sergeants and four civilian staff.The Children Act 2001, which came into law in May 2002, gave a statutory basis to the juvenile diversion programme which includes a restorative justice aspect. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the year 2003, the Garda National Juvenile Office received 19,915 referrals under the programme relating to 17,043 individual offenders. The number of juvenile referrals processed by the National Juvenile Office in 2004 was 20,607. Detailed information will be included in the Garda Síochána Annual Report for 2004. Early assessments indicated a very high level of satisfaction from those involved in the process.Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. All Garda juvenile liaison officers have received training in restorative justice and over half have received training in mediation skills. It is expected that the ongoing development of restorative justice within the juvenile diversion programme will lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of recidivism.In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are in existence a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects. Funding of €5.471 million has been allocated to these and other related projects in the current year. The Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all situations, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turn in the process of maturing into young adults. Moreover, research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 88% do not come to the attention of the Garda Síochána again by their 18th birthday.The juvenile diversion programme already exists on a nationwide basis and is delivered throughout the country by specially trained gardaí. Resource implications are constantly under review and applications for additional resources are made on a case by case basis when and where necessary.In relation to Garda resources generally, the House will be aware that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the juvenile liaison scheme will be fully taken into account.

A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens' rights is not readily available. However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána indicates that in 2003 — the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available — of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department, there were 34 cases of alleged assault recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest recorded. The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year 2004, 127 actions were initiated-received. They included 40 cases of alleged assault and 26 cases of alleged unlawful arrest. In the year 2005 to date, 55 actions have been initiated-received. They include 24 cases of alleged assault and nine cases of alleged unlawful arrest.Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda Síochána is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of these cases have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined as appropriate with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question. One of the principal aims of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána which will secure public confidence and which will address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.Year (Total Amount)AssaultUnlawful ArrestOther€€€2001 €1,619,746.83Awards1,904.61 (1)20,950.68 (2)22,220.42 (1)Settlements123,164.59 (5)33,965.49 (3)162,782.25 (9)Costs244,665.35123,199.41886,894.03Total369,734.55178,115.581,071,896.702002 €1,240,388.40Awards1,270 (1)3,809.21 (1)56,500 (2)Settlements166,924.48 (6)106,835.58 (10)185,078.82 (11)Costs230,769.67148,714.19340,486.45Total398,964.15259,358.98582,065.272003 €1,276,127.55Awards11,000 (1)10,000 (2)4,870 (2)Settlements75,000 (4)303,011 (5)112,814.84 (4)Costs145,561.7071,794.28542,075.73Total231,561.70384,805.28659,760.572004 (Provisional) €938,799.09Awards15,000 (1)03,215.06 (1)Settlements198,697.48 (5)73,007 (5)50,500 (3)Costs231,646.62100,019.36266,713.57Total445,344.10173,026.36320,428.632005 (Provisional) €758,316.58 as at 22/06/05Awards2,250.00 (2)Settlements37,500 (2)21,114.00 (4)Costs30,882.90 (3)622,887.04 (9)43,682.64 (10)Total68,382.90646,251.0443,682.64The number of cases in which awards were made by the courts and the number of cases which were settled out of court are shown in brackets in each case.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	966	I refer to my response to Question No. 382 of Tuesday, 31 May 2005, which was also submitted by the Deputy.The persons concerned are a mother and her two sons who arrived in the State in October 2002 and claimed asylum. Following a full and fair examination of their case at every stage of the asylum process, their applications for refugee status were refused. After a further examination of their case under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, deportation orders were made in respect of them on 28 June 2004. The persons concerned were notified and the orders passed to the Garda National Immigration Bureau for enforcement.In arranging the family's return, it was necessary for the Garda National Immigration Bureau to obtain travel documents for them from the Turkish Embassy. This required the attendance of the family at the embassy in Ballsbridge, Dublin, for the purposes of establishing their nationality and identity. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the family was brought to the embassy where they were interviewed by a consular official in the presence of a member of the Garda National Immigration Bureau. The interview was described as cordial by the attending garda. This has been confirmed by the Turkish Embassy in an open letter to The Irish Times, published on 25 May last.The family concerned recently made an application, through their legal representatives, for readmission to the asylum process, under section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. This is being considered in my Department at present and in the meantime their removal has been postponed, pending a decision.Where a deportation order is made, it is the responsibility of the Garda Síochána to effect the order. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that the procedure for obtaining travel documents is dictated by the issuing embassy, not by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, and the practice varies between embassies. It is therefore not a question of facilitation, but of complying with the particular requirements of embassies for issuing their own travel documents.In many instances it is necessary for the Garda National Immigration Bureau to obtain travel documents from the embassy or consulate of the relevant country concerned. This is principally because the persons being returned are not in possession of passports which may have been destroyed or are deliberately withheld from the gardaí to frustrate their removal. In some instances, the passports have expired.It need hardly be said that where an application for refugee status has been made and has been granted after examination by the relevant independent determination bodies, that is, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the issue of approaching an embassy for a travel document does not arise. Where, as in this instance, it has been determined that no protection or humanitarian issues arise which prevents the person from being removed no prohibition exists against contacting the relevant embassy or consulate to facilitate the person's removal from the State.

I indicated at that time that I had no intention of renegotiating the proposal for organisational change which had already been arbitrated upon by the Civil Service Arbitration Board as to do so would compromise the integrity of the whole industrial relations process which had served the State so well. I made my position in this regard very clear at a meeting with the POA on 29 April and in subsequent correspondence.Following on the POA Annual Delegate Conference in early May, the POA indicated to me that a motion had been passed at the conference mandating the association to re-open discussions on a cost neutral realignment of additional hours bands so that a greater number of prison officers could operate on a "zero" additional hours commitment. They indicated that they were preparing a detailed submission and that they would be seeking a meeting with me and my officials to explore its potential. They also asked me to defer or put on hold certain Government approved measures to address overtime costs including the closure of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention, the redeployment of staff and the outsourcing of prisoner escorts. I again made it clear that I was not in the business of renegotiating the proposal for organisational change and that I was not prepared to put on hold measures to secure essential cost efficiencies. I expressed serious doubts about the proposal to realign the additional hours bands which had already been agreed and arbitrated upon as it was clear to me that anything more than a very modest tweaking of the additional hours bands would upset the delicate balance achieved between the already negotiated and arbitrated elements of the deal and would compromise the very integrity of the arbitration process.I can now confirm that the Prison Officers' Association recently submitted proposals for the re-alignment of the additional hours bands. Having considered these proposals, I am satisfied that they would fundamentally alter the deal which was on the table and would seriously compromise the integrity of the industrial relations machinery, in particular the arbitration process. In these circumstances, I had no option but to indicate to the POA that its proposals were totally unacceptable. I also indicated that I would be pressing ahead with the alternative measures which have been well aired over recent months.I have gone as far as I can with this process. We have reached the end of the line in terms of discussions on the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service and I will not be led down the path of renegotiation. It is regrettable that the considered and painstakingly developed approach negotiated over such a long period of time may not now be realised. My preference has always been for an agreed way forward. I have no option now but to move ahead, with or without agreement, to implement whatever other measures are required to realise the necessary cost efficiencies with all due urgency.I should point out that I have invited the POA to meet with me so that I can outline in detail my plans for going forward into the future.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	968	As I have previously indicated to the House, I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 to provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders.I am concerned at the extent to which the quality of life of decent law abiding citizens can be adversely affected by the anti-social behaviour of a minority. I am therefore proposing that the gardaí should be able to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which would prohibit the person from behaving in an anti-social way.The principle behind anti-social behaviour orders is similar to the power to bind over to keep the peace and-or be of good behaviour and is not, as some critics would appear to think, a new concept. An anti-social behaviour order is simply a mechanism whereby the law seeks to stop a person from behaving in a way which is causing distress to a community or to some person in that community.In formulating my proposal I am conscious of the need to balance the rights of individuals with the rights of the community. While the UK model is of value I have no intention of slavishly following it. My proposal will contain some important differences. For example, in the UK an anti-social behaviour order must apply for a minimum of two years. I consider a minimum period of two years to be inflexible and I will be proposing that the order can only operate for up to a maximum of two years. There will be other important distinctions such as the fact that the power to apply for the order will be limited to senior gardaí and the penalties for a breach will be very significantly less than those which apply in the UK.A particular concern which has been voiced is the application of anti-social behaviour orders to children. In this regard, I intend that the proposal will be specifically tailored to integrate into the Children Act 2001 and will attract the protections of that Act. I would, in particular, point out that anti-social behaviour orders complement the Children Act by providing an additional alternative to prosecution in the first instance.I hope to bring my final proposal to Government for approval to draft in the near future. I also intend, subject to Government approval, to make my proposal available and to send it to the Human Rights Commission and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	969	The Judicial Council Bill, the scheme of which is in development in my Department, will establish a judicial council with responsibility for a number of matters. Among these will be the devising of a code of ethics and the management of a process, to be set out in the Bill, for the investigation of complaints about judicial misbehaviour. An important feature of the disciplinary process will be provisions requiring lay participation, that is to say people who are not judges or lawyers, in that process. Other matters to be included in the council's functions will be responsibility for judicial education and training and the exchange of information among judges on such matters as sentencing. In these regards, the Bill will build on the Report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics chaired by the former Chief Justice Ronan Keane.The preparation of the scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage. I am engaged in a number of necessary consultations on the draft scheme at present and I expect to be in a position shortly to bring the scheme to Government for approval. It is my intention that when the scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government, I will make it available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Any views that may emerge from the joint committee can be taken into account during the drafting of the Bill, which will be proceeding at the same time.

I set out in detail my response to the reports and my proposals for reform of the Garda Síochána arising from the findings and recommendations in both the first and second reports of the tribunal. I also refer the Deputies to my statement in the House on Tuesday 21 June in the course of Private Members' time.The most immediate response to the second report was to address the cases of individual wrongdoing or gross negligence uncovered. Two superintendents criticised in the second report are to retire at the end of next month. The implications of the findings for other serving members of the force below the rank of superintendent are being considered by the Garda Commissioner and, furthermore, the report has been given to the Director of Public Prosecutions.I recognise that a much wider response is needed to address the system failures which allowed this wrongdoing to take place. That response is contained in the Garda Síochána Bill which is being debated in this House today. The Bill will comprehensively reform and enhance the civilian oversight and democratic accountability of the Garda Síochána. Significant amendments have been made to the Bill drawing on ideas from all sides of the House since it was initiated. In addition, I have recently published further amendments, which are being debated on Report Stage of the Bill this week, to take account of recommendations in the second report of the tribunal.The new measures I am proposing in these further amendments include establishing a new statutory duty to account for members of the Garda Síochána when required to do so by a member of higher rank; enabling the Garda Commissioner, with the consent of the Government, to dismiss a member of the force below the rank of superintendent where the Commissioner is of the opinion that by reason of the member's conduct his or her continued membership would undermine public confidence in the force and where dismissal is considered necessary to maintain public confidence in the force; strengthening the existing provisions in the Bill obliging the Garda Commissioner to supply the Minister with information of significance relating to policing and security matters; strengthening existing provisions in the Bill on the accountability of the Garda Commissioner and making clear that the Commissioner is fully accountable to the Minister and the Government; strengthening provisions on the promotion system; changing the method of appointment to the new Garda Audit Committee; providing that one of the three members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will be appointed as chairperson; and providing a power, which replaces a broadly analogous but narrower power under the Dublin Police Act 1924, for the Minister to appoint a person to carry out a special inquiry into any aspect of Garda administration, practice or procedure which is giving rise to public concern.These measures combined with the other measures in the Bill, including provision for the establishment of a Garda Síochána inspectorate which is to ensure that the resources of the Garda Síochána are used to achieve the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness compared to best police practice, represent a comprehensive response to the reports of the Morris tribunal.

The Minister of State also advised Ministers that, to ensure progress, it was intended to bring a six monthly report to Cabinet on the gender composition of boards for each Department.Since commencement of the policy of reporting on a six monthly basis to Cabinet, there has been a noticeable improvement, particularly in relation to appointments made by the Government or Ministers. However, where appointments are made on foot of nominations by other bodies, there is still a significant deficit.When I brought the fourth six-monthly report to Government on women's representation on State boards to Cabinet on 26 January 2005, the Government decided that for the future, nominating bodies will be required to "nominate both male and female options for those appointments to State Boards where they are the responsible authority".The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has since written to all Ministers requesting them to put in place the necessary procedures to implement the Government decision. Future six-monthly reports to Government will include specific reference to the implementation by each Department of this decision.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	974	I am aware of the concerns of residents regarding anti-social behaviour and acts of vandalism in communities and, along with my commitment of introducing new legislation to assist in combating this, I am assured by the Garda authorities that all available resources are actively targeting the problem. Ensuring public safety by reducing the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour is one of the six strategic goals of the Garda Síochána policing plan for 2005.Strong provisions are already in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour. Operation Encounter is an initiative by the Garda authorities designed to address specifically public disorder and related issues, in particular by targeting key offences under this legislation, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Intoxicating Liquor Acts and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.Because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions is the use of temporary closure orders. The Act broadened the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which had been introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of public order offences, such as supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and the duty on licensees to preserve order on licensed premises.The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.This year I succeeded in securing an all-time historic high level of funding for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its associated agencies. The gardaí, the courts and the prisons together with the Department have never been better resourced or equipped.This funding will enable a number of key public policy initiatives to go ahead next year. Included in these are the recruitment of additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force by 2,000 within two years bringing its total complement to 14,000. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.While I am pleased to note a reduction in assault causing harm in 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, the incidence of anti-social behaviour remains a matter of concern to me. I am therefore taking a number of initiatives to strengthen the powers available to the Garda Síochána to combat anti-social behaviour. These include my proposal for a fixed charge procedure in relation to certain public order offences in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which is currently at Second Stage in the House.I am particularly concerned that people, particularly the elderly, feel threatened by forms of harassment which of themselves may not be a criminal offence but which may cause distress. For this reason, I announced last December that I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill to provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders. I propose that the gardaí should be able to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which would prohibit the person from behaving in an anti-social way. The principle behind the orders is similar to the power to bind over. It is therefore not a new legal concept.I accept that because of the immaturity of young people, applying anti-social behaviour orders to them requires a somewhat different approach to that adopted for adults. Therefore my proposals, in so far as young people are concerned, will be specifically tailored so that they are integrated into the Children Act. However, the anti-social behaviour order, backed up by appropriate enforcement, is in itself a practical measure to prevent young people progressing down the path towards serious offending — which is one of the main purposes of the Act.As the Deputy is aware, Garda youth diversion projects are funded by my Department. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project. The projects are a tangible measure of crime prevention and reflect a commitment to multi-agency partnerships in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The work of the projects involves linking young people with non-offending peer groups and the forming of stable and trusting relationships with adults in the community. The intended impact of this process is that those so engaged develop into responsible citizens and that they do not progress into the criminal justice system.I attach great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda Síochána and local authorities on matters affecting policing. My intention, as set out in the Garda Síochána Bill, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora will provide arenas where the Garda Síochána and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues which are in the management of the local authority and where the gardaí can make a strong case for their particular interests to be taken into account.The Bill specifically provides that among the functions which the committees will be particularly mandated to carry out is keeping under review the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in their area, including the patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs, and the factors underlying and contributing to those levels of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour. Local policing fora will discuss and make recommendations to their committees concerning these matters as they affect their neighbourhoods. These are significant innovations which will strengthen policing at local level. They will ensure that the new committees and their sub-structures will provide a permanent forum to address the issue of anti-social behaviour.I have mentioned legislation which I have already introduced to combat the abuse of alcohol and the public order problems to which it gives rise. I have recently published the general scheme of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2005, which will carry forward this work as part of a consultation process. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws. It will also contain provisions which will combat anti-social behaviour.The Government is strongly committed to the reduction and prevention of crime through strong and effective crime prevention methods. However, I cannot stress enough that while legislative measures can help to curtail the problem of anti-social behaviour, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. All those with an interest in this area have to play their role in helping to address the problems of vandalism and anti-social behaviour in our society.

Moreover, they participate at all levels of Europol activity. The primary purpose of Europol is to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence and to carry out detailed analyses of crimes within its remit in order to assist EU member states in preventing and combating international organised crime. It is there to support national law enforcement authorities and to facilitate EU police co-operation.In addition to Garda liaison officers based at Europol and Interpol, there are four Garda liaison officers based in major European capitals. These liaison officers assist inquiries relating to significant criminal investigations which have a connection to this jurisdiction.The exchange of evidence between jurisdictions for criminal prosecutions is governed by international conventions and related domestic legislation.The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 gives effect in Irish law to an agreement at European Union level which attempts to ensure that international boundaries are not used by criminal gangs to their advantage. It provides for the setting up of joint investigation teams by mutual consent of member states for a specific purpose and limited period. A joint investigation team can carry out a criminal investigation with a cross-border dimension in one or more of the member states setting up the team.There is regular contact between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland regarding cross-Border organised crime and last year the two police forces launched the first ever joint organised crime threat assessment.

The full text of the visiting committee's report has been publicly available on the website of my Department since 5 April 2005.I deeply regret that two suicides of prisoners occurred at Arbour Hill Prison in January 2004 and in August 2004, respectively. In its report, the visiting committee drew to my attention the circumstances of these two deaths and, furthermore, that in October 2004 a third case of attempted suicide by a prisoner at the prison had been averted by the vigilance of prison officers. Separately in its report, the committee itemised the health care available in the prison and stated its conclusion that "the absence of a dedicated Psychiatrist remains a cause of concern and is pertinent to the "suicide issue" dealt with in greater detail in this report". The committee also set forth several recommendations including one stating that "Arbour Hill's Psychiatric and Psychological services be enhanced and extended and existing shortfall in Psychologists be addressed immediately."In view of the circumstances of the two deaths referred to by the visiting committee, including concern about the return to the prison of the inmates after short stays at the Central Mental Hospital the matter was formally raised with both the Governor of Arbour Hill Prison and the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital to establish whether there were any circumstances pertaining which might merit review to lessen the risk of similar incidents in the future. The consensus was that the overall risk presented was appropriately recognised and all reasonable steps were taken to meet the needs of the prisoners involved. As regards duration of stay at the Central Mental Hospital, the position is that decisions regarding the admission of prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital are taken by consultants from that hospital based on clinical indications. Similarly, clinical decision processes apply to the return of prisoners when sufficiently recovered, as pertained in the cited cases.In relation to psychiatric services, the position at Arbour Hill Prison, and the other prisons in the Dublin area, is that visiting psychiatric services are provided to the prison on a regular basis by psychiatrists based at the Central Mental Hospital. This consultant-led service undertakes regular weekly clinics in the prison together with regular input from a community forensic psychiatric nurse. The present input is felt to be adequate for the needs given the population of Arbour Hill Prison. However, given the increasing prevalence of mental disorder among the prison population, the overall adequacy of psychiatric provision across the prison system is being kept under ongoing review.In relation to shortfall of a psychologist at Arbour Hill Prison, the position is that a new psychologist took up duty at the prison on 30 May 2005 bringing the complement of psychologists there to two.

Therefore, the multitude of different costs incurred by the inquiry into the death of Mr. Barron were accounted for in the normal manner under the relevant general sub-heads of the Votes concerned. For this reason it would not be possible to retrospectively cost the investigation without the reallocation of scarce resources on a scale that would be impractical.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	979	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 63 together.I am advised by the Garda authorities that currently there are 130 Garda stations equipped with audio-video facilities. A recently conducted Garda survey indicates that 98.1% of interviews as specified in the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997 are now being recorded. Interviews are not recorded mainly because either the arrested person declines to have the interview recorded or the equipment is already in use or is otherwise unavailable.I have indicated already that my intention is to move the number of interviews recorded towards 100%. I should point out again that it was never the intention that all Garda stations be equipped with specialised audio-video recording equipment. Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to give broad nationwide coverage. In this regard, the recently published Third Report of the Steering Committee on Audio and Audio-Video Recording of Garda Questioning of Detained Persons found that, with the putting in place of additional units of equipment in a number of stations which already have the facility, there are a sufficient number of Garda stations, in all Garda divisions, to ensure that all interviews as specified in the regulations are recorded. A Garda working group has been established to implement the recommendations of the report.

With regard to public order offences the primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.I was pleased to note a reduction in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 15% reduction in assaults causing harm in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	981	The Deputy will appreciate that the Children Act 2001 is a complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments: the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science mainly in respect of juvenile offending; and the Department of Health and Children mainly in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.Three main areas of the Act for which I have responsibility remain to be brought into operation. These concern the age of criminal responsibility, community-based options, and the provision of children detention centres for 16 and 17 year old offenders.As stated, it was envisaged at the time of enactment that the provisions of this Act would be implemented on a phased basis. The community sanction provisions are largely a matter for the probation and welfare service of my Department to implement. In line with this, provision is being made by the probation and welfare service to allow for the commencement, on a phased basis, of the remaining sections of the Act relevant to the probation and welfare service.Currently, young offenders coming before the courts may be placed under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service in accordance with: (i) section 2 of the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 (Probation Orders); or (ii) section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 — in the case of those aged 16 years or over.Since May 2002, a restriction on movement order — sections 133 to 136 — may be imposed. In addition, since July 2004, courts can order that a family conference be arranged by the probation and welfare service with all interested parties in a case so that an action plan can be drawn up in the individual case. The child concerned must have acknowledged his or her culpability and the action plan must come back to court for approval. If the child complies with the elements of the action plan, the court may, at the end of the period covered by the plan, dismiss the charge or charges.A pilot mentor project — sections 131 to 132 — is due to commence very shortly in the north Dublin area. The programme will serve as a model for the development of the mentor — family support — order. Recruitment of staff for this new and innovative project has taken place with the employment of a co-ordinator and administrator. The programme will recruit volunteers who will act as mentors to young people who have been before the courts and are under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.It is envisaged that parental supervision orders — sections 112 to 113 — will be commenced on a pilot basis later this year.Other provisions under the Act require capital investment prior to commencement for buildings, equipment and expanding programmes. Work is already under way regarding some of these provisions, the details of which are as follows. In regard to a day centre order — Part 9, sections 118 to 123 — a new probation office which is due to open in Cork very shortly will have provision for meeting the requirements of the day centre order. The development of a similar provision for the Tallaght area have been incorporated into plans for the new Tallaght probation and welfare service office which is expected to be completed in 2006. In regard to a probation — training or activities programme — order — Part 9, section 124 — the probation and welfare service has identified programmes already being funded through the service that meet the service requirements under this sanction. In addition, the service is also working towards the development of additional facilities suitable for use. In regard to a probation — intensive supervision — order — Part 9, section 125 — preliminary meetings have taken place to explore the feasibility of establishing two pilot intensive supervision programmes in Cork and Dublin, utilising existing intensive probation supervision projects. Preparatory work is ongoing in this regard. In regard to a probation — residential supervision — order — Part 9, sections 126 to 127 — it is envisaged that this section will commence later this year. A document has been prepared outlining standards for probation and welfare service funded hostels. In preparation for meeting these standards, staff of hostels will require training and development. Work is under way to identify suitable training which will meet these needs and training will be organised for staff over the coming months. In addition, Cork probation hostel is being extended and refurbished to meet the required standards and this hostel is expected to reopen very shortly. In regard to a suitable person — care and supervision — order — Part 9, sections 129 to 130 — this order will require the same rigorous recruitment, screening and training elements as outlined in the Standards on Practices and Procedures in Foster Care. Suitable persons will have to be recruited and trained. Work on implementation of this order is expected to commence early next year; and regarding a dual order — Part 9, sections 137 to 139 — this sanction will be developed, on a phased basis, as day centres become available.Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts, either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.I advise the Deputy that the issue of the appropriate age of criminal responsibility is being considered in the context of implementing the remaining aspects of the Children Act 2001 and the review of youth justice services which is currently being finalised in this Department.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	982	I want to emphasise that the Government places a high priority on putting into place measures aimed at tackling crimes of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault and other crimes of violence against women. In this regard, my Department, which is one of five Departments with responsibilities in this area, plays a major role in that it has responsibility for legislative initiatives and preventative measures that can be put in place, such as intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence, awareness raising measures aimed at changing society's attitude to domestic violence and identifying and developing any necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice systems.While I have always urged caution in the interpretation of short-term statistics, I was pleased to note decreases in aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault — the largest category of sexual offences - rape of a female and unlawful carnal knowledge in the provisional headline crime figures for the quarter ending 31 March 2005 compared with the corresponding quarter last year. I was concerned, however, to see a recorded increase in the number of cases of rape under section 4 of the Crimine Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990.With regard to the number of detections, I assure the Deputy that any incident of rape or sexual assault reported to the Garda Síochána is fully investigated, as much evidence as possible is gathered and, subsequently, a file is forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction as to whether a prosecution should proceed.As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his function and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions.I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the majority of cases the victim knows their assailant's identity. A study carried out by the research unit, Garda College for the period 1994-97 shows that 87% of the victims knew their assailant's identity.The Garda Síochána actively encourages people who are the victims of any crime to report the offence to the gardaí. In addition, a number of established initiatives underpin this policy, such as the Garda confidential telephone number, Crimestoppers and Crimecall.As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, there is a high attrition rate in rape cases in Ireland, and a large number of cases reported to the gardaí do not reach prosecution stage for a variety of reasons.My Department has approved joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, which is entitled "The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases", is being carried out by the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, is being conducted over three years and is expected to be completed in 2007-08. This research should provide a greater understanding as to why some victims choose not to report cases to the gardaí, what can be done about under-reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing. It is important to note that, with regard to conviction rates, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the constitution and the law. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions.Following completion of this research, action will, as appropriate, be taken to resolve any issue that may arise.

The first of these four intakes — 275 — commenced training on 7 February 2005. The second of these four intakes — 275 — commenced training on 3 May 2005. The remaining two intakes are scheduled to commence training on 2 August 2005 and 7 November 2005, respectively.I am further advised that between 6 June 2002 and 22 June 2005 a total of 1,570 members have graduated from the Garda College; a total of 1,343 members — all ranks — have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda Síochána; and a total of 1,882 members have been attested to the Garda Síochána.Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees become serving members of the force. Thus the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase three of their training but have not yet formally graduated — formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. The strength of the force has therefore increased by 539 members since June 2002.

Of this number, over 7,300 applicants have to date been granted temporary permission to remain in the State.Some 48 applications have so far been refused. A breakdown of the reasons for such refusals is as follows: 37 applicant parents and-or the Irish born child were not resident in the State; three applicants were not the parent of an Irish born child; four children were born after 1 January 2005; two applicants had a criminal record; one application was received after closing date of 31 March 2005; and one application made from abroad. It should be noted that a significant number of incomplete applications are currently under examination or are being held pending the submission of documents.

The proposed amendment will allow me, by order, to declare a period during which firearms, ammunition and offensive weapons may be handed in to Garda stations. My detailed proposals in this regard will be announced to the House in the normal way in due course.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	987	I have noted the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency policy statement on child poverty.The €499 million Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 already has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents, particularly those from low-income families, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education. The programme provides capital grant assistance to create and enhance new and existing child care facilities and staffing grant assistance to community based-not for profit organisations whose child care services have a strong focus on the support of the child care needs of disadvantaged families, wishing to avail of employment, training or education.Over €440 million has been allocated to child care projects in both the community based sector and to private providers. This funding, when fully drawn down, will lead to the creation of some 39,900 new child care places, benefiting parents seeking and using child care. I am very pleased to note that 24,600 of these new places were in operation by the end of 2004. Of the funding committed to the end of June 2005, over €233 million has been approved towards capital projects, with a further €153 million towards staffing grant assistance.Staffing grant assistance provides support towards the staffing costs of employing child care workers in community based child care centres in disadvantaged areas. Its contribution towards these costs allows the centre to implement differentiated fee structures to benefit less advantaged parents.The Deputy may also be interested to note that funding committed to the end of June 2005 includes the provision of over €70 million to child care services operating in RAPID areas, which are specially designated for urban regeneration. In addition, over €33 million has been allocated to projects located in CLÁR areas, which are specially designated for rural regeneration. As a result of this funding many low-income working families and work-poor households benefit from the equal opportunities childcare programme.I would like to reiterate that this Government remains firmly committed to supporting working parents with their child care needs through increased capacity, choice and service quality. To this end considerable progress has already been achieved in terms of increasing the supply of centre based child care places, as noted above, while affording financial support towards the costs of child rearing through child benefit which has increased very significantly over the past seven years.Child benefit is the main fiscal instrument through which support is provided to parents with dependent children, and this support is provided to all parents irrespective of income and employment status. In his 2005 Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced further increases of €10 per month to €141.60 per month for the first two children and €12 per month to €177.30 per month for third and subsequent children from April 2005. This means that over the period since 1997, the rate of child benefit has almost quadrupled. This level of increase is unprecedented and delivers on the Government's objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to parents in relation to the care of their children. One of the main advantages of this approach is that, whereas other supports such as tax relief would be of little or no benefit to those with low incomes, the provision of support for parents through Child Benefit means equality of treatment for all recipients, including high-earners, low-earners and the work poor.As can be seen, this Government's record in providing enhanced child care supports is without parallel and I am confident that we are moving rapidly to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country.

Since then, a further charter flight to Romania was carried out on 1 June 2005, returning a total of 58 persons including eight minors. Of these, 36 were subject to deportation orders, 19 had been refused leave to land in the State and a further three persons returned home voluntarily after withdrawing their asylum applications. The cost of the flight was €82,720, excluding Garda expenses which are not available for the same reasons given in my earlier reply.

Therefore the multitude of different costs incurred by the inquiry into the death of Mr. Barron and by the related investigations referred to by the Deputies were accounted for in the normal manner under the relevant general sub-heads of the Votes concerned. For this reason it would not be possible to retrospectively cost the named investigations without the reallocation of scarce resources on a scale that would be impractical.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	990	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murders in which firearms were used in respect of each year from 1998 to 22 June 2005 are as set out in the table below.I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders. This is not unique to Ireland. The number of violent deaths, namely, murder and manslaughter, recorded in 2004 is 45, the lowest number recorded in ten years, despite our population increasing by 400,000 during the same period.I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by the Garda Síochána to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his functions and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions. Furthermore, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions also.As the Deputy will be also aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently on Second Stage in the House, provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences.In the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, I propose to bring forward, on Committee Stage of the Bill, a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearms offences, including the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases. I am also introducing a new offence of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence. My full range of proposals will be announced in the House in the normal way in due course.

As the Deputy will be aware last February I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document which are currently being examined. However, it is already clear, from the submissions received to date, that, among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general welcome for my proposals to strengthen the enforcement provisions, in the 1875 Act.I now propose to use the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, to make the necessary amendments to the 1875 Act. I propose to bring forward, on Committee Stage of that Bill, amendments which will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I am also proposing to significantly increase penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.The Criminal Justice Bill is currently on Second Stage in the House and it is my intention to have it enacted as quickly as possible.

The terms of the apologies will be settled as part of the resolution of the related civil actions currently before the courts.As regards any offer of a financial settlement of the case currently before the High Court involving Mr. McBrearty Junior, I am legally constrained in what I can say about the detail of any confidential discussions between counsel for the State and counsel for Mr. McBrearty, but I can confirm that there is ongoing communication and discussion between the two legal teams.

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. As each cycle of recruit training is completed, the Garda Commissioner will assign these new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities, which include the traffic corps. All personnel assigned to the new traffic corps will have completed the standard training programme.I am informed that the strength of the Garda traffic corps over the next four years will rise as set out hereunder:YearNumber2005563200680520071,03020081,200It should also be noted that all members of the Garda Síochána have responsibility, inter alia, to deal with road traffic and community policing issues as they arise.The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources that come on stream as the strength of the Garda Síochána increases to 14,000 members. Clearly the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as community policing and the need to very significantly increase, as I have already outlined, the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

The purpose of the commission will be to examine how such allegations and complaints were handled by church and public authorities.Under the provisions of the Commissions of Investigation Act, the approval of the Minister for Finance is required before a Minister proposes to Government the establishment of a commission of investigation. Accordingly, a draft memorandum for Government proposing the establishment of a commission of investigation into the handling of allegations of sexual abuse by members of the clergy operating under the aegis of the Archdiocese of Dublin was submitted by my Department to the Department of Finance in December 2004 for the approval of the Minister for Finance.I am currently in discussion with the Minister for Finance with a view to obtaining his approval to circulate the draft memorandum for Government.

The RIA places particular emphasis on meeting, to the greatest extent possible, the dietary needs of residents and, in this regard, 28-day menu cycles are in place in all large centres. In small centres menus are cycled on a seven-day or 14-day basis. The menus offered reflect the reasonable needs of the different ethnic groups and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated in centres.All contractors are required to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner each day. Breakfast must include eggs, a choice of a minimum of six cereals, a choice of three or four juices, a selection of fruit and cheese, milk, tea, coffee, toast, brown and white bread, rolls and a selection of spreads, jams and preserves. Lunch must consist of a choice of three light main courses, to vary daily, together with salads, rice, potatoes, juices, tea and coffee. In the case of dinner, it must include a choice of two starters, one hot and one cold, or desert or yoghurt and a choice of three main courses, to vary daily, to include a meat dish, a fish dish and a vegetarian dish. Dishes on offer for dinner include chicken, lamb, lasagne, Nigerian style egg fried rice with chicken, chicken egusi, Romanian chicken stew, ogbuno soup and pounded yam, lamb kleftico, lemon pepper haddock, pork paprika and roast joints. Dinner also includes rice, potatoes, chips and tea, coffee, milk, soft drinks and water. Tea, coffee, biscuits, crackers, cheeses and fruit are made available, at the discretion of contractors, outside of normal meal times.Where there are children in centres, a selection of baby foods and yoghurts must be on display and available. In the case of infants, infant formula, infant food and fresh water for the preparation of infant formula must be available. As regards schoolgoing children, a packed lunch to include at least a sandwich, fruit and a beverage are provided.All contractors are required to consult regularly with residents to ascertain what foods they prefer and how such foods should be cooked. These meetings are particularly important where many ethnic groups may be accommodated in the same centre. Every effort is made to ensure that the ethnic and dietary needs of residents are met. However, maintaining this on a daily basis for all the different ethnic groups can sometimes prove difficult. Menus are kept under review and are revised from time to time with a view to meeting the ethnic dietary needs of residents to the greatest extent possible.Regular inspections of centres by RIA staff and by an independent inspectorate are carried out and appropriate measures are taken where the requirements of residents are not being met. In addition, RIA staff, including senior management, regularly eat in centres to ensure that the fare on offer is of the standard required.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	999	The national disability strategy, launched by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 21 September 2004 represents the Government's targeted response to delivery of disability services. The launch involved seven Ministers with direct responsibility for the various elements of the strategy because of the cross-cutting nature of the issues involved. The strategy has been advanced by a cross-departmental group of senior officials reporting to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and comprises four elements: the Disability Bill 2004, which is the direct responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability equality in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Frank Fahey; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; six outline sectoral plans which are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, Transport, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and a multi-annual investment programme, from 2005 to 2009, providing over €1 billion for high priority disability support services, mainly in the health and education areas, which was announced as part of the budget on 1 December 2004.The Disability Bill has since completed all Stages in this House and was passed by the Seanad yesterday. It now remains for the House to accept the Seanad amendments.While my Department has a key role in the development of disability equality policy and legislation, it is not directly involved in the provision of services for people with disabilities. Since the policy of mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities was introduced in June 2000, responsibility for the provision of services for people with disabilities rests with the same Department or agency which has the responsibility for providing the services generally.The focus on mainstreaming and social inclusion is given particular emphasis through the significant obligations placed on public bodies under Part 3 of the Disability Bill in relation to buildings and services and through the six sectoral plans under that Part. This will ensure that access for people with disabilities will become an integral part of service planning and provision. The six Departments with responsibility for preparation of sectoral plans will be required to undertake consultation with stakeholders before the plans are finalised and presented for approval to the Oireachtas. These Departments are the Departments whose policies have the greatest impact on the lives of people with disabilities.

The report sets out the work of the board for the year and the progress made in a number of areas. I do not intend to go into detail on these as they are set out in the report itself and referred to in my press release of 14 June when I launched the report. That said, I note with satisfaction that the number of cases on hand at the end of the year has been reduced to 473 — a reduction of 21% from the corresponding 2003 figure. I also welcome the fact that the average processing time for complaints has been reduced to five months.I am particularly heartened by the board's supportive comments regarding the establishment of the new three person Garda Ombudsman Commission. The chairman also highlights the fact that the main legislative defects in the current mechanisms are addressed in the Garda Síochána Bill. Indeed, he is of the view that every member of the present board would strongly favour the new powers being proposed for the Garda Ombudsman Commission.As the Deputy is aware I have already appointed a committee, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, to oversee the implementation of the Garda Síochána Bill, including the establishment of the new Garda Ombudsman Commission. I look forward to the assistance of the board and its staff in this element of the task.

To conduct an independent review and undertake a thorough examination of the Garda Síochána papers relating to the making by Mr. Dean Lyons of false inculpatory statements in the course of the Garda investigation into the murders of Mary Callinan and Sylvia Shiels on 6 and 7 March 1997(a) with a view to identifying an appropriate means of establishing how he came to make those statements;2. To make recommendations on(a) actions to be taken and procedures to be put in place with the aim of preventing similar statements being made again in the future, taking into account Garda Síochána procedures in place at the time to ensure that its duty of care to vulnerable individuals under investigation was fulfilled and any subsequent changes to those procedures;(b) and any further actions to be taken on foot of the recommendations of the review;3. And, in this regard, to submit a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as soon as possible.I have asked Mr Murphy to complete his review as a matter of urgency.

These will be made available in conjunction with the statutory planning process. In accordance with the Department of Finance regulations, the Prison Service is currently preparing a business case regarding the development for submission to the Government. It is intended that construction of the prison development will commence in late 2006. The cost of this project will be determined following a procurement process in line with EU directives and public procurement guidelines. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to give an indication in relation to costs at this stage as this would be commercially sensitive information which may affect the tendering process. The site selection process was undertaken by a committee which included the Irish Prison Service, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of Public Works and a commercial property expert. The minutes of the committee's deliberations have been published. One meeting has been held between officials of the Irish Prison Service and a group of representatives from the local primary school.

He undertook a review of police complaints which led to the establishment of the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland and his work there and on the Patten Commission involved the study of police services in several countries.I am aware of the views expressed by Senator Maurice Hayes on certain provisions in the Garda Síochána Bill. I was aware of his views before I appointed him as chairperson of the implementation advisory group, and had no hesitation in asking the Senator to take on the task. I am proposing a number of amendments to these provisions in the course of Report Stage debate on the Bill in the House this week.I agree with Senator Hayes's recent comments in the Seanad indicating that the enactment of the Garda Síochána Bill should not be delayed any further.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1009	The World Organisation against Torture, OMCT, registered a complaint against Ireland and four other countries with the European Committee of Social Rights under Article 17, rights of children and young persons to social, legal and economic protection, of the Council of Europe Revised European Social Charter. The complaint was made under Article 3 of the additional protocol which allows specified non-governmental organisations to submit collective complaints. Ireland and the four other countries against which the complaint was registered, signed and ratified the additional protocol in 2000.The complaint was considered by the European Committee of Social Rights. Its report found that "the lack of an adequate prohibition on the corporal punishment of children within the home, in certain child care settings, foster care and in residential care constitutes a violation of Article 17 of the Revised Charter".The issue of corporal punishment in the home falls within the remit of my Department. The common law recognises the right of a parent to inflict moderate and reasonable physical chastisement of a child. The Law Reform Commission, in its 1994 report on non-fatal offences against the person, LRC 45 — 1994, recommended that while it would be premature to abolish the common law chastisement exception immediately, the re-education of parents should proceed without delay and the exception should be abolished when the time was right.Government policy in this area is expressed in the national children's strategy, launched in November 2000. One of the objectives of the strategy, which has a ten year life span, states "... As part of a policy of ending physical punishment, parenting courses will focus on alternative approaches to manage difficult behaviour in children". The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the strategy. The present legal arrangements can be reviewed in light of the developments arising from the strategy and any constitutional considerations which may arise.Ireland's response to the complaint was considered by the Committee of Ministers and Deputies and a resolution was adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 8 June 2005 noting, inter alia, the intention of the Government to keep the introduction of an outright ban on corporal punishment under review.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1010	I can inform the Deputy that the Sex Offender Act 2001 provides for separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault trials where an application is made to the court in the course of the trial to adduce evidence or cross-examine on the subject of the complainant's past sexual history. When preparing this legislation the legal advice available to my Department was that there would be constitutional impediments to full separate legal representation for the duration of a trial. The 2001 Act measures represented a serious effort to allay some of the concerns of complainants in such trials without breaching a fundamental principle, the right of an accused person to a fair trial.The Deputy may also wish to note that legal advice, as opposed to representation, is also available, through the Legal Aid Board, to complainants in rape and certain sexual assault cases. This service is currently subject to a means test and persons who satisfy the financial eligibility criteria are provided with this legal advice free of charge. I can inform the Deputy that I have recently decided in principle that this service should be provided without a means test and I intend to seek Government approval to the inclusion of a provision which would give effect to this in a suitable legislative instrument in the near future.In so far the comments attributed to the chairperson of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre regarding the perception of the courts are concerned, the position is that the Courts Service has invested significantly in upgrading facilities for all users of the courts including provision of victim support rooms. In this regard the proposed criminal court complex in Dublin will provide several victim support suites for all victims of crime. The Courts Service is also reviewing the size of courtrooms in new developments so that victims and their families can be separated from the accused and his or her family. I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the funding recently announced by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to provide for court accompaniment services. Women's Aid has been allocated €28,000 to assist in providing such a service to victims of domestic violence and the Rape Crisis Network is to receive €50,000 for accompaniment of victims of sexual violence.

When the investigation is completed, a file will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.I am further informed that Garda personnel from the southern Garda region, Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and Criminal Assets Bureau are involved in the investigation, and liaison is also ongoing with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.As the Garda investigation remains ongoing, I do not consider that further detailed comment on the matter would be appropriate.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1012	I am informed by the Garda authorities that substantial progress is being made with the investigation into the crimes referred to by the Deputy, with searches being conducted by members of the Garda Síochána resulting in 26 persons being arrested and questioned. Firearm, drugs, cash and other property were seized during these searches. Two persons have been charged and are before the courts on related charges. Further charges are currently being contemplated. Local gardaí are liaising with specialist units from national support services in these investigations, which are ongoing.Significant reductions have been noted in the number of robberies from security vans since the commencement of Operation Delivery. Operation Delivery was initiated in June 2004 in direct response to the increase in robberies of cash in transit in the Dublin area to counter the increase in this type of crime. Among the activities undertaken are: the profiling and targeting of suspects; the searching of premises associated with suspects; the disruption of activities of suspects; the surveillance of suspects; liaising with cash in transit companies; and intelligence gathering and analysis.On 16 May the Commissioner initiated Operation Anvil, a special intelligence-led operation within the Dublin metropolitan region with additional resources made available to him. The primary focus of this operation is the deployment of increased Garda resources to prevent and detect serious crime, especially where firearms are involved. To date, as a result of the operation 377 arrests have been made and 76 firearms recovered.I wish to advise the Deputy that it has not been possible to compile the statistical information requested in the timeframe allowed. I will arrange for the information to be forwarded directly to the Deputy at the earliest possible opportunity.I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the necessary resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	I am aware of the claims made in the Amnesty International report for 2005 but am firmly of the view that they are not well founded. I will address the position in respect of each of the categories of person referred to by the Deputy in turn.Beginning with the rights of people with disabilities, I believe the Government has demonstrated its commitment by developments over the past eight years, including more recently, the national disability strategy which was launched by the Taoiseach on 21 September 2004. The launch involved seven Ministers with direct responsibility for the various elements of the strategy which comprises four elements: the Disability Bill 2004, which is the direct responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability equality in my Department, Deputy Frank Fahey; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; six outline sectorial plans which are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, Transport, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and a multi-annual investment programme, from 2005 to 2009, providing over €1 billion for high priority disability support services, mainly in the health and education areas, which was announced as part of the budget on 1 December 2004.The strategy builds on existing policy and legislation including the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Equality Act 2004 and the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the policy of mainstreaming service for people with disabilities within the State agencies that provide the service to citizens generally.The Disability Bill is a positive action measure designed to support the provision of disability specific services to people with disabilities and to improve access to mainstream public services for people with disabilities.The national disability strategy overall presents a practical approach to recognising rights, including in particular increased investment to build service capacity and structures to inform planning and development of key services.Turning to the claims made in respect of asylum seekers, in focusing on the Immigration Act 2004, the report fails to take account of the vibrant and thriving jurisprudential environment in this jurisdiction which has shown itself to be well capable of ensuring that the highest human rights standards are maintained and developed. The report's analysis therefore minimises the impact of the Constitution, the aforementioned jurisprudence and other relevant statutory provisions, including the Human Rights Act 2003.The Act of 2004 represents only part of the picture. For example, the general prohibition on refoulement and the right of an asylum seeker to enter the State are dealt with in the Refugee Act 1996, but are nonetheless central to the Irish immigration regime. Similarly criticism of the absence of a statutory appeal mechanism in relation to the making of a deportation order fails to take into account that such orders constitute the end of a protracted process under the Immigration Act 1999 which guarantees the applicant the right to be made aware of a ministerial proposal to deport, to make representations and to have those representations taken into account. In the case of failed asylum seekers, those entitlements follow a statutory right to independent consideration of claim by two separate independent agencies.In so far as the criticism in relation to monitoring of immigration controls at airports is concerned, it is not clear to me that the persons performing immigration duties at busy ports and airports throughout the State, acting on my behalf, are incapable of discharging their duties in accordance with law unless they are attended by "independent human rights monitors" particularly when no evidence is adduced to suggest that a contrary situation exists. The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission is, in accordance with its functions under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 charged with keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and to that end is empowered to conduct relevant inquiries either of its own volition or at the request of any person.With reference to the Irish born child issue, the constitutional probity of my approach to the residency of the parents was upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of L and O v Minister for Justice [2003] 1 I.R. 1. Notwithstanding the outcome of that case, I am currently in the process of examining the applications of 18,000 non-national parents for residency in the State on the basis of their parentage of Irish citizen children.With regard to the claims made in respect of prisoners, Amnesty International's report states, inter alia, that detention conditions did not comply with international standards. I can inform the Deputy that there are standing independent mechanisms for systematic oversight of the operation of the prison system and of the conditions of custody and the treatment of all persons detained therein. These are as follows: prison visiting committees, which visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints made to them by prisoners. Visiting committees have free access, collectively or individually, to every part of the prison. Prison visiting committees report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and their reports are published. There is the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, who is responsible for inspecting and reporting on prison conditions, including the health, safety and well-being of prisoners. There is also the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which during its visit to a State party, has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained. To date, the committee has visited Ireland on a total of three occasions in 1993, 1998 and 2002.In so far as education and employment programmes are concerned, I can inform the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service employs a number of means to encourage prisoners to bring about positive development within themselves, including programmes in the areas of education,vocational and pre-vocational training and lifeskills; specific programmes and individual counselling to address criminogenic factors, for example, anger management, sex offenders programmes; individual and group counselling and support; drug treatment; and facilitating the involvement of voluntary organisations in providing appropriate prisoner support services.These programmes are delivered by a wide range of specialist services that operate in the prisons, such as psychologists, teachers, probation and welfare officers and prison officers.Significant developments in the areas of prisoner education and work and training are as follows: in regard to education, participation in prison education continues to be greater than 50% which is very high by international standards. At the end of 2004, the participation rate was 51%. Almost half of the participants were intensively involved, that is, for more than ten hours per week of classes.Other developments of note include Prison Education in Ireland — A Review of the Curriculum, which was published in 2004 and continues to inform the future development of the prison education curriculum, and a prison adult literacy survey and guidelines for quality literacy work in prisons which were published in 2003. Implementation of the survey recommendations and the guidelines is ongoing. For example, the prison education service will be co-ordinating the introduction for the prisoner population of the literacy assessment tool, Mapping the Learning Journey, to be launched by the National Adult Literacy Agency in 2005. This tool will provide the first national framework for monitoring and recording the progress of literacy learners.In regard to work and training, the Irish Prison Service is continuing to work with FÁS and other vocational training bodies to review and update, where appropriate, work and training activities and courses to ensure that prisoners can access marketable skills and vocational qualifications to improve their prospects of employability in the labour market on their release.To assist in the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the work and training services to prisoners, the Irish Prison Service is developing a work-training database which will be rolled out to all institutions during 2005. The database will facilitate the tracking of prisoners' participation and progress in work and training activities and courses during the course of their time in custody.In relation to the report's concerns regarding an independent and impartial individual complaints mechanism for prisoners, the Deputy may be aware that I have recently published new draft prison rules which will replace the current outdated 1947 rules. The prison rules deal with all aspects of prison life, including discipline.The new rules provide for a comprehensive approach to prison discipline for prisoners, allowing for independent hearings for serious cases and an appeals mechanism. Full account of international instruments, including the latest draft of the European prison rules, rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and best practice have been taken in drafting the new rules. The rules respect the rights of prisoners while taking account of the practicalities of running a prison and ensuring prisoners are kept in safe and secure custody.Although I expect to sign the rules into law during the summer, a lead-in time of several months will be required to give an opportunity for prison staff and others to familiarise themselves with the new rules. It is my intention therefore that the new rules will enter into force in November 2005.Under existing procedures, a prisoner may complain of ill-treatment to the governor of the prison, a member of the visiting committee of the prison, the director general of the Irish Prison Service or to me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is also open to a prisoner to report a matter to the Garda Síochána, pursue a civil action for damages in the courts or communicate a complaint to any appropriate third party. Rule 109 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons 1947 provides that a prison officer shall without delay inform the governor of any prisoner who desires to see him, or to make any complaint or to prefer any request to him or to any superior authority.Where a prisoner makes a complaint alleging ill-treatment, the complaint is investigated by the governor. In any case where a criminal offence is disclosed, the governor may request the Garda Síochána to undertake a police investigation with a view to obtaining evidence to support a criminal prosecution.Based on the findings of the report of an investigation into a complaint of ill-treatment, the governor may decide to take disciplinary action against a member of staff in accordance with the Prison (Disciplinary Code for Officers) Rules 1996.In considering the claims made in respect of funding of services in the field of domestic violence and violence against women, the Deputy should note that main responsibility for funding organisations supporting victims of such violence lies with the Department of Health and Children. That Department is responsible for the provision of health and social services to victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. In the main, these services are provided by non-governmental organisations who receive funding for this work from the Department. In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the provision of crisis accommodation such as refuges.My Department is responsible for any necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice systems, for any preventative measures which can be put in place, including intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence and for awareness raising measures aimed at changing society's attitude to violence against women. My Department also co-ordinates the work of the national steering committee on violence against women and the Deputy may wish to note that a new strategic plan is currently being drawn up, with broad consultation, to identify a work programme in this area for the next five years.I can further inform the Deputy that an interdepartmental group comprising the Departments with responsibilities in relation to violence against women, has been convened by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, and chairperson of the national steering committee on violence against women, to discuss the roles, responsibilities and budgets available within each Department towards addressing the issue. I expect this group to report this summer and that its conclusions will feed into the preparation of next year's Estimates.The claims made by Amnesty International do not stand up under careful analysis or when confronted with the considerable investment of resources and expertise devoted to providing services to the categories of person referred to.

Fixed charge notices are issued in all cases where an address is available.

The authority publishes these statistics in its annual road traffic facts reports. The most recent report relates to 2003 and indicates that there were a total of 301 fatal collisions and 5,684 injury collisions in that year. The statistics show that the condition of the road is a contributory factor in 2.8% of fatal and injury collisions, where contributory factors are specified. The reports, however, do not contain details of collisions which occur specifically on temporary road surfaces.The National Roads Authority, in conjunction with local authorities, operates a programme where accident locations on the national road network are investigated and, if the road condition is believed to have been a factor, appropriate engineering measures are put in place to improve the situation.In addition, as part of its work on road safety the National Roads Authority has, since early 2001, incorporated a road safety audit procedure into the design standards for national roads. Road safety audits involve the evaluation of road schemes during design and construction and aims to prevent crashes occurring on a new road scheme, rather than trying to improve the situation after crashes have taken place.

The report highlights the findings of research carried out in the ten former health boards during 2004, involving some 450 older people and 150 health and social services staff.The study sought to investigate whether older Irish people experience ageism within health and social services and, if so, to ascertain the impact of this experience. Ageism refers to deeply rooted negative beliefs about older people and the ageing process, which may lead to age discrimination.The Department is committed to promoting healthy ageing and to an age friendly society. The Department is also committed to ensuring that older people, who have contributed to the development of our society, are treated with dignity and respect when receiving health care services.The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the provision of health care services throughout the country and must ensure that all the services it provides are age friendly. The Department will be liaising with HSE in relation to the recommendations in the report.

The report reviewed existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards and concluded that the services available for persons with cystic fibrosis in this country are not up to standard.The report provides an assessment of current and future needs of cystic fibrosis patients. It makes recommendations regarding the numbers and categories of staff that are appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service. Following publication of the report, the Health Service Executive, at the request of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, established a working group to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland, both in hospitals and in the community. The working group will also make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services.The working group is multidisciplinary in its composition and includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. It held its first meeting in early April and hopes to complete its work over the next few months. The Pollock report is one of a number of reports relating to cystic fibrosis services being considered by the group. The work of the group will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	It is a condition of the drugs payment scheme, DPS, that no individual or family will pay more than the relevant monthly threshold of €85 in a calendar month. The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, administers the payments process for the DPS. According to the PCRS, the payment of a second co-payment in one month, in one pharmacy, should only arise when a person is intentionally getting the next month's supply on the grounds that he or she will be away the following month or for another such reason. The only exception to this rule is where the packaging of a particular medicine or appliance is such that a client requires 13 dispensings in a 12 month period, as with 28 day packs for example. In this situation, to ensure that an individual or family makes no more than 12 payments in a year it is recommended that, where appropriate, once in a 12 month period or periodically throughout the year, more than a 28 day supply may be given. The packaging of the medicine or appliance will influence how this can be achieved.It is accepted that an adrenaline pen is not a medication where a month's supply can be defined. In the initial set-up period for the patient, more than one pen would be required. Periodic replacement will be required, depending on use or expiry dates. This particular situation is accommodated under the DPS.

Assessments for the years in question had earlier been issued by Revenue in accordance with the returns of income submitted. In these returns the taxpayer had stated that all the profits accrued to him. Kilkenny district office informed the taxpayer on 8 and 27 April 2005 that it could only amend tax years back to 2000-01 due to time limits and only then if evidence that a partnership between the taxpayer and his wife was furnished. To date this information has not been received by the Revenue Commissioners.

The main factors determining the estimate are the discount rate, pay, length of service and life expectancy. The latest estimate of the present value of pensions of people now employed in the public service is €30 billion. It should be pointed out that provision for the actual payment of pensions is made in the annual estimates of expenditure and from pension funds of semi-State organisations where such funds have been established.The national pensions reserve fund, which is controlled and managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, will part-fund the costs of both social welfare and public service pensions over the longer term. An amount equivalent to 1% of GNP is invested in the fund each year by the Government. No funds can be drawn down before 2025. From then on, draw downs will be made in accordance with rules laid down by the Minister for Finance in the light of the projected increase in the number of people over 65 in the population to avoid undue variation from year to year in the net Exchequer position. The fund's value at end March 2005 was €12,309 million.

The relief is granted at the highest rate of tax at which the taxpayer is chargeable for the year of the claim. Relief cannot be claimed for any expenditure that has been, or will be, reimbursed by a medical insurer or where a compensation payment is, or will be, made in respect of the expenditure.The first €125 of any medical expenses incurred in any tax year is borne by the taxpayer. In the case of an individual claiming relief in respect of two or more persons, the taxpayer must bear the first €250 himself or herself.Claims for health expenses are made on form MED 1. While it is not necessary to submit receipts with the form MED 1, the receipts relating to the costs must be retained by the individual as he or she may be asked to produce them if the claim is chosen for detailed examination.An individual may claim tax relief on certain medical expenses incurred by him or her on his or her own behalf, on behalf of a dependant, or on behalf of a relative. A dependant is any relative of the taxpayer or any other person who at any time during the year of claim is aged 65 years or over or who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. A relative is defined as a husband, wife, ancestor, lineal descendant, brother or sister, mother or father of the taxpayer's spouse, brother or sister of the taxpayer's spouse, spouse of the taxpayer's son or daughter, the taxpayer's child or any other child who, for the year of the claim, is in his or her custody and maintained at his or her expense and under 18 years of age, or if over 18 years of age, is receiving full-time education.Regarding co-habiting couples, the position is that an unmarried person cannot claim tax relief on health expenses incurred in respect of his or her partner unless such partner is either aged over 65 or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. The position regarding children is that unmarried parents can claim tax relief in respect of their own child or their partner's child, subject to the conditions above being satisfied.I have no plans at present to further broaden the categories of those in respect of whom a claim for health expenses relief may be made.

However, under the Referendum Act 1994, the expenses of returning officers concerned with the holding of referendums are met from the Central Fund, which is administered by my Department. The Act also provides that postal expenses incurred during the holding of referendums are met from the Central Fund. On 7 June 2001, referendums were held on the proposed 21st constitutional amendment on the abolition of the death penalty; the proposed 22nd constitutional amendment on the Treaty of Nice; and the proposed 23rd constitutional amendment on the International Criminal Court. It is not possible to disaggregate expenditure to identify that which relates solely to the proposed 22nd amendment. The second referendum to which the Deputy refers, held on 19 October 2002 was solely in respect of the proposed 26th constitutional amendment on the Treaty of Nice. The costs met from the Central Fund are detailed in the following table.Although the Office of Public Works is not funded directly or indirectly by my Department, my Department has asked that office to communicate to the Deputy any relevant information relating to expenditure it incurred in respect of the referendums in question.7 June 200119 October 2002€€Expenses of Returning Officers4,998,364.342,233,808.78Postal Expenses9,737,311.351,189,000.00

Council Directive 2003/98/EC Re-use of Public Sector Information lays down ground rules for the re-use of public sector information for commercial purposes. The statutory instrument effecting the transposition was signed by the Minister for Finance on 16 June 2005 and will be published in Iris Oifigiúil on Friday, 24 June 2005. The EU Commission will be formally notified immediately upon its publication therein. The deadline for implementation is 1 July 2005.Council Directive 2004/106/EC of 16 November 2004 amends Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums and Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products. The purpose of the directive is to remove from Council Directive 77/799/EEC and from Council Directive 92/12/EEC any reference to mutual assistance on excise duties. Mutual assistance in the area of excise will now be dealt with by EC Regulation No. 2073/2004. This directive requires transposition by 1 July 2005 and my Department has been examining the matter with the Attorney General's office on the specific aspects, if any, of the directive that remain to be transposed.Council Directive 2005/19/EC of 17 February 2005 amends Directive 90/434/EEC 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchange of shares concerning companies of different member states. It amends the 1990 mergers directive, which provides tax neutrality for cross-border company restructuring. The amending directive extends tax deferral to a larger number of cases and improves the methods to secure tax neutrality while safeguarding the financial interests of member states. The deadline for transposition is 1 January 2006 and it is expected that it will be transposed by ministerial order before that deadline with confirmation of the order in next year's Finance Bill as is the normal practice.Council Directive 2004/18/EC: Revised Public Sector Procurement Directive, co-ordinates the procurement procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006 and it is envisaged that the directive will be incorporated into Irish law well in advance of this date.Council Directive 2004/17/EC: Revised Utilities Sector Procurement Directive, co-ordinates the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sector. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006 and it is envisaged that the directive will be incorporated into Irish law well in advance of this date.Council Directive 2004/39/EC: Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MIFID, allows investment firms to provide their services across the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation, that is, it will give them an effective single passport. The deadline for implementation is 30 April 2006. However, on 14 June 2005, the Commission published a proposal to extend the deadline by which member states must transpose this directive by six months, that is, until 30 October 2006. This recent proposal must be ratified by the Council and the Parliament. It is expected that this directive will be incorporated into Irish law by the deadline of 30 October 2006.Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructures the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. The deadline for transposition was 31 December 2003. As was already outlined in response to the parliamentary question reference number 14648/05 of 5 May 2005, Ireland was already in compliance with all significant requirements of the directive prior to the deadline. The outstanding elements of the directive have been provided for in Finance Act 2005, subject to a commencement order in one instance. A letter notifying the Commission of this position has issued.Council Directive 2004/56/EC of 21 April 2004 amends Directive 77/799/EEC and concerns mutual assistance in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums. It provides for a single set of rules to be applied to the information gathering process by a member state in responding to a request for assistance from another member state. In addition, the directive provides for all information made known to another member state to be subject to the same privacy rules as information gathered under the national legislation of the member state providing the information. The deadline for transposition was 1 January 2005. A statutory instrument is being prepared and it is expected that the directive will be transposed in the coming weeks.Every effort is being made by my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to ensure that any outstanding directives will be transposed as a matter of urgency and that remaining directives will be transposed on time.

From the brief information provided, it seems likely that the individual will be employed and paid by an Irish employer and, therefore, the income he receives will be fully chargeable to income tax in Ireland, notwithstanding that the funding of the salary may be coming from a source outside of Ireland. In addition, the cost incurred by the employer in providing accommodation to the individual in question will constitute a taxable benefit-in-kind.The question of liability to PRSI is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

Late last year, I met a delegation from the Carra Mask Corrib Water Protection Group Limited, along with my colleagues the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, at which I heard the group's views on the causes and effects of the enrichment of these waters.I share the concerns expressed for the stocks of salmonids and freshwater pearl mussels and take confidence from the assurances given by the Ministers and the agencies operating under their aegis, to work in partnership with local interests to find practical and effective solutions to address the matter. I assure the Deputy that the central and western regional fisheries boards will make every effort to ensure that fishery concerns are placed high on the agenda when these solutions are being implemented.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection and conservation of inland fisheries is a matter for the regional fisheries boards, in this case, the Western Regional Fisheries Board. I am aware, through that board, that an aggressive alien plant species known as Lagarosiphon major or curly water weed has been identified in Lough Corrib. This weed, originally from Africa, poses a serious threat to fish and other wildlife in the area. It is thought the weed was introduced to Ireland through garden centres as a product for ornamental garden ponds.I am advised that the Central Fisheries Board and the Western Regional Fisheries Board, together with Galway County Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, have recently established a Lagarosiphon task force. The main aim of this task force is to determine and implement all the possible options for the control and the possible elimination of this invasive alien species.The task force held its first meeting in Oughterard, County Galway on 26 May this year and has already produced an information leaflet detailing what anglers, boat owners and the public should do to combat the spread of the weed. The task force has also issued a press release to relevant national, regional and angling press to inform the general public of the threat associated with this invasive alien species.I assure the Deputy that the agencies concerned are continuing to work together to address this problem.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1051	On 15 June last, I was pleased to launch, on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy and the Irish Char Conservation Group, their publication entitled "Threatened Irish Freshwater Fishes". This publication makes a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of some of Ireland's rarer native species, which are an important and unique aspect of our natural heritage. The publication brings together important information on what these rare fish species are, their distribution and status, as well as recommendations for their future conservation.Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection and conservation of freshwater fish stocks rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. I understand that measures to protect the species referred to in the Royal Irish Academy's publication are being taken by the fisheries boards in the context of the European Union water framework directive.The status of smelt, shads and lamprey populations is currently being investigated by the central and regional fisheries boards, as part of the national fisheries research programme and in specific locations, on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. According to the Central Fisheries Board, while some populations of char have become extinct in the past 30 years, smelt and lamprey are more widespread than originally thought and appear to be reasonably stable. The board also advises that while populations of twaite shad continue to occur in south eastern rivers, anecdotal evidence suggests that numbers are significantly depleted.The knowledge shared through the publication "Threatened Irish Freshwater Fishes" will assist the central and regional fisheries boards in their task of conserving and protecting these species. The fisheries boards are co-operating closely with other Departments and agencies, particularly the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, in rolling out the water framework agenda. The fisheries boards have assured me that they will make every effort to ensure that, under this agenda, sufficient priority and focus will be placed on addressing the pressures on these particular species and restoring the habitats concerned.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1053	The provision of broadband services is a matter for the fully liberalised private sector, regulated by ComReg, the independent Commission for Communications Regulation. ComReg is also responsible for the issuing of fixed wireless access local area, FWALA, licences.Digital subscriber line, DSL, is the most popular broadband delivery platform in Ireland, with over 84% of broadband customers using this technology. There are, however, limitations to the delivery of broadband by DSL, such as distance from a telephone exchange and line quality, so other delivery platforms such as fixed wireless, optic fibre, satellite and cable modems each have a part to play in the rollout of broadband.The 120 metropolitan area networks being built by my Department, in association with the local and regional authorities, are optic fibre based and offer the telecommunications sector open access. The broadband delivery method chosen by a service provider is a matter of choice, depending on market conditions and individual customer's needs.The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, and a number of companies already offer broadband access using this technology. Wi-Fi is also gaining in popularity and is already on offer in selected locations. Market forces will determine if and when Wi-Fi is offered in a given area.

The figure had risen to over 152,000 by 30 March 2005, however, figures for 1 June 2005 are not yet publicly available.Questions relating to the enabling of telephone exchanges for broadband are operational matters for Eircom. However, I understand that the company has announced that it had over 140,000 working DSL lines by 27 May 2005 and aims to have 90% of lines broadband enabled by March 2006.ComReg does not have projections for broadband take-up. However, Eircom has stated that it aims to have 500,000 DSL subscribers by December 2007. This is equivalent to 30% of households in Ireland. While DSL will continue to be the dominant broadband delivery platform for the foreseeable future, the rollout of fixed wireless access networks under ComReg's fixed wireless access local area, FWALA, scheme is a development that will help stimulate platform competition which is crucial to increasing broadband penetration in Ireland in the coming years.

Notwithstanding that, BP Oil Limited and Shell UK Oil Limited own the company jointly, BPA remains of the view that there is no conflict of interest. While I accept that BPA will have completed the review in a fully professional and objective manner, I remain conscious of the association of Shell UK Oil Limited with BPA by means of its 50% ownership of the company and I regret that this situation ever arose. In the interest of ensuring confidence in the independence of the process of evaluation of the safety aspects of the pipeline as addressed by the QRA version F and considering the public concerns and sensitivities on this issue, I instructed officials of my Department to initiate a further review of the QRA. I can confirm that my Department has engaged a consultant to carry out this further review of the QRA.My officials are at present completing their assessment of the developers' application to install and commission the onshore pipeline. The decision in relation to this application will not be finalised until the consultant's report in relation to the QRA has been received and assessed. I should also add that the consultant's report will be put into the public domain in north Mayo and on the Department's website as soon as possible after receipt.I have no function in relation to any profits that the developers gain from the Corrib gas field.There are many benefits that the people of Mayo and the country at large can gain from the development of the Corrib gas field. Over the life of the Corrib field it will contribute to reduced importation of natural gas and an enhancement of our security of supply of energy. The construction work will contribute to Exchequer income from corporation, payroll and indirect taxation in so far as it relies on sourcing of Irish skills, staff and material. Operations will similarly contribute to the Exchequer and will also yield lease rental income. In addition to sharing in general prosperity, communities in Mayo will benefit where there is local sourcing of workers, services and goods. Direct construction employment will be of the order of 100, will rise to 500 and then fall back to 200 over the project period. It is anticipated that 50 to 60 staff in three shifts will be employed to operate the terminal. It is the stated policy of the operating company to recruit and train local staff to work the terminal and I understand that main contractors and subcontractors on the project have recruited some of their labour requirements locally.

However, before an appointment can be confirmed, the agreement of the Ecuadorian authorities must be obtained. Once this has been received I will proceed with the appointment.Pending finalisation of the appointment, Irish citizens in Ecuador may seek consular assistance from the embassy of any other EU member state in Quito. They may also contact the Embassy of Ireland in Buenos Aires, which is monitoring the situation in Ecuador in relation to consular assistance.Honorary consuls are not full-time employees of the State but are private individuals who undertake, in addition to their normal work, to provide a range of consular services to Irish citizens abroad. As a condition of their appointment, honorary consuls undertake to put in place the necessary staff and office resources to provide these consular services.

The Government must consider on an ongoing basis the desirability of Ireland signing or becoming party to those agreements which it has not already signed or become a party to.Given the number and range of international agreements involved, signature, ratification or accession will not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.If the Deputy has a query concerning Ireland's position with regard to a particular international agreement which Ireland has not signed or become a party to, I will endeavour to provide him with the information he requires.

The previous month the US Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, BICE, requested a travel document for this person from the consulate in Boston to facilitate his deportation. When submitting the request, BICE included a photocopy of an expired passport which had been issued by our embassy in London in May 1994 valid to May 2004. On foot of this request, the consulate in Boston issued a travel document valid from 15 February until 15 March 2005.The consulate is not aware of any contact from this person since his deportation. If the person claims that there has been misuse of his passport details and-or wishes to obtain a new passport, he should contact the Passport Office, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2.

In the same period, new greenfield, first-time jobs in County Kildare in IDA assisted companies accounted for 1% of total new greenfield first time jobs approved.Employment figures in IDA assisted companies in Kildare over the last four years were as follows:Employment Data20002001200220032004No. of Companies2929282824Permanent Employment10,67810,10810,12210,23310,310Kildare continues to thrive across a broad range of activities in the housing, commercial, services and industrial sectors. As a result, many job opportunities are being created within the county. The population of the county continues to grow well above the national average and in 2004 significant developments in overseas investment were announced, namely, the largest ever ICT investment in the country by Intel of €1.6 billion in wafer fabrication; and a €21.4 million technology development centre by Hewlett Packard.Other overseas companies in the county such as Wyeth Medica, Oral B, Tegral Products, IFS, and Athy Concentrates continue to provide solid job opportunities.

Employment will reduce from 480 to 235 following the restructuring. However, I understand that the company has chosen Ireland as the international manufacturing site for its next generation electronic mirrors and that this will involve substantial new capital investment at its plant in Naas. This is expected to ensure the long-term viability of the plant.The 245 redundancies that the company has deemed necessary, are expected to be achieved through a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme. Notwithstanding this, the manager of the FÁS training services unit in the midlands region has visited the company and provided briefing on the full range of services available from FÁS. The company has indicated that it will be in contact with the agency again before the end of this month.As Minister for Enterprise, my objective is to ensure that our economy remains a globally competitive, profitable and secure location for business. We can best help enterprise, including the manufacturing sector, by continuing to implement policies that are pro-business and by implementing the right balance of enterprise supports and at the right time to help business. When provided with the best supporting and competitive environment, business and industry will develop to capitalise on investment and growth opportunities. It is the Government's intention to enable enterprise growth by policies tailored to address the competitive pressures transforming the global economy.Manufacturing has been a key driver of prosperity across the economy for many years and enterprise policies will continue to emphasise the strategic importance of the sector to future economic growth. The enterprise strategy group, ESG, recognised the importance of the sector in providing a foundation of skills and technologies on which to build a high performance, high value added and technologically orientated manufacturing sector into the future. We must realise, however, that global competition from fast developing economies is placing unprecedented competitive pressures on manufacturing plants, and particularly those involved in low margin activities. Some firms will be unable to compete in these new competitive circumstances.Nevertheless, the success of many world class plants gives us some solid cause for optimism that our manufacturing base will continue to operate at the leading edge of technologies and processes, while sustaining significant employment. From a policy perspective it is important to put in place selective initiatives to maximise this potential. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have specific programmes to assist their manufacturing clients tackle competitiveness problems.I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by the Government and by the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department will continue to maximise sustainable job creation and investment opportunities. The capacity of our economy to consistently expand quality employment opportunities, not only for our own labour force but for thousands of immigrants, strongly suggests that we have significant competitive strengths in the global context.

Subsequently, in January 2005, following discussions with Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council, IDA Ireland decided to strategically withdraw its planning application relating to these works, with a view to resubmission at a later date.IDA Ireland was of the view that additional information would serve to better support its application at approval stage. In this regard, IDA is in discussion with the local authorities about submitting a revised application. This process is currently at an advanced stage and it is envisaged that a revised application will be submitted over the coming weeks.IDA is currently involved in legal action in relation to this case and thus it would not be proper to comment on some of the points raised in the question at this stage.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1071	The management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio, including the purchase and disposal of property, is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and not a matter in which I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have any direct function.Compilation of the material required to answer the question requires extensive research and it is not possible to undertake this research in the timescale permitted. I have asked IDA Ireland to revert directly to the Deputy with the information requested within a period of two weeks.In the interim, the sequence of events leading up to the enactment of the recent emergency legislation in the Oireachtas is outlined for the Deputy's information.IDA normally sells land by means of a 999-year lease. This lease incorporates a restrictive user clause limiting the use of the land generally to manufacturing and or internationally traded services.IDA was served with a notice by a leaseholder at Clonshaugh seeking to acquire the freehold interest in the land pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Acts. Under the provisions of these Acts, lessees may acquire the freehold interest provided that certain conditions are met. While terms of the lease entered into by the IDA did not meet the criteria set out in the Acts, the company holding that lease created a sub-lease, the terms of which fulfilled the criteria for eligibility to acquire the freehold interest. The sub-lease was acquired by a connected company which immediately applied to acquire the fee simple. Having received clear legal advice that the applicant company was entitled to acquire the freehold interest, the IDA negotiated a settlement with the company the terms of which are the subject of a confidentiality agreement between the parties.The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 2005 was enacted on 19 May 2005. The purpose of the legislation is to protect the State's interest in lands acquired by the three industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta. The legislation includes these agencies as a bodies excepted from the application of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No 2) Act 1978. From the operative date, any lessee holding a lease from these agencies or a sub-lease under that lease is restricted from acquiring the fee simple in those lands.

Up until the expiry of the 18-month period the content of a patent application including the description of the invention remains secret and is not disclosed by the Patents Office to anybody. An application which is withdrawn by the applicant prior to the expiry of the 18-month period is also never disclosed by the office.Patent applications filed at the Patents Office in Dublin are normally transmitted to the Patents Office in Kilkenny using a courier service. A record is kept of all the documents being transmitted. The office considers this procedure to be secure and has never has a case of a document being lost or a package interfered with.The Patents Office acts as a receiving office for European patent applications and patent applications filed under the patent co-operation treaty. On receipt, such applications are transmitted by registered post to the European Patent Office in The Hague and to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva. The office is satisfied that this procedure is secure and does not permit unauthorised disclosure of patent documents.All documents held within the Patents Office, including unpublished patent documents, are held in a secure modern storage facility. Public access to the Patents Office is restricted and there is no such access to the working or file storage areas. In addition, the staff of the Patents Office are civil servants and are subject to the Official Secrets Act.The office is satisfied that its internal administrative and security arrangements are such as to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of confidential documents including patent applications and that any disclosure of patent applications is only made in accordance with the legislation.

Furthermore, rent supplement is not ordinarily paid unless the local authority is satisfied that the applicant has a housing need which the local authority is not in a position to address. However, the regulations provide the Health Service Executive with discretion to pay a rent supplement where it considers the exceptional or special circumstances of the particular case so warrant.The family concerned is residing in local authority housing. It has made inquiries about its rent supplement eligibility but has not made a formal application. The western area of the executive has advised that, in its opinion, the circumstances in this case do not warrant payment of rent supplement in respect of private rented accommodation as an alternative. The family has been advised that the most appropriate course of action in its case is to request their local authority to transfer it to another house elsewhere.

The main element of this policy is an earnings disregard of €146.50 per week. This disregard is designed to help towards expenses incurred from taking up employment such as travel, child-minding etc. There is no disregard given to a person whose income is an occupational pension.I have given a commitment in my Department's statement of strategy to review the operation of income support arrangements for lone parents. Pending the findings of this review, there are no plans to amend the qualifying criteria for the one parent family payment.

People who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been on this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.Further extensions to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.

Some current examples are: the one parent family payment — the first €146.50 weekly earnings plus 50% of earnings from €146.51 to €293 are disregarded; unemployment assistance — 40% of net earnings from part-time work are disregarded; farm assist — 30% of earnings from self-employment are disregarded; family income supplement — 40% of net earnings are disregarded; retention of rent-mortgage interest supplement and other secondary benefits on a tapered basis in certain circumstances; and tapered withdrawal of adult and child dependant increases as the spouse-partner's earnings from employment increase.In the interests of improving take-up, the agency proposes the examination of delivery mechanisms that employ the taxation system as well as the social welfare benefits system. Payment of FIS through the tax system has been considered in this context by a working group including the social partners, the remit of which was to examine the role which refundable tax credits could play in the tax and welfare system.While the report of the group is awaited, I expect that it will recommend that FIS will continue to be paid by my Department, with a modified system of delivery and sustained efforts to improve take up.My Department will continue to explore ways in which payment mechanisms can be improved and public awareness of entitlement increased.The question of further improvements in benefit withdrawal arrangements will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.

This group is scheduled to report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion by the end of July.We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation, individualisation, maintenance and secondary benefits. The findings of this group will feed into the work of the senior officials sub-group.I am also giving serious consideration to the introduction of a second tier of child income supports, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. A study being carried out at the moment by the National Economic and Social Council is examining the possibility of amalgamating social welfare child dependant allowances with family income supplement payments. The objective is to provide an integrated channel for resources to low income families without creating disincentives to employment.It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to final concrete proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged.I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps.

Member states are required to have the provisions of the directive transposed into national law by 23 September 2005.In Ireland, the Pensions Act 1990 already provides for much of the framework set down in the directive. A number of further amendments to the Pensions Act were recently included in sections 27 to 37 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 to ensure compliance with the directive. Regulations are also required to set out some of the more detailed requirements relating to investment rules, qualifications for trustees of schemes and cross-border arrangements.The drafting of these regulations is under way and I am confident that all the necessary legislative measures will be enacted before the transposition date.

The maximum fine for a second or subsequent offence is €1,500 and in the case of a third or subsequent offence committed within a 12 month period €1,500 and-or a prison sentence of up to three months.Those levels of maximum fines were established in the Road Traffic Act 2002 and represent very significant increases over the maximum fines that could be applied to that offence under previous legislation, which were €190, £150, in respect of a first offence and €440, £350, in respect of a second or subsequent offence.This offence currently comes within the scope of the on the spot fines system and, in association with the majority of other parking offences, it attracts an on the spot fine of €19.The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the on the spot fine system with the new fixed charge system. That system currently applies to the offences of exceeding a speed limit and non-compliance with seat belt regulations. Regulations to provide for the roll-out of that system to a significant number of additional traffic and parking offences are currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. This extension of the operation of the fixed charge system will include its application to the offence of illegally parking in disabled person's parking bays. The level of the charge for that offence will be pitched at a level significantly higher than that which will apply to other parking offences.The operation of the fixed charge system is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda. I understand that it is expected that the new system will be available later this year.

The programme has delivered 220 km of cycle lanes for the investment.The most recent data available to the DTO on cycling levels in the Dublin area have been obtained from the 2002 census. As the table below shows, the number of cyclists who cycle to work and school in the GDA declined between 1996 and 2002. The decline is particularly pronounced for journeys to school. There has been a decline in numbers cycling to work and to school in every GDA local authority area.Cycling to WorkCycling to SchoolYearTripsMode shareTripsMode Share199625,5675.3%20,9706.4%200221,3263.4%12,5624.0%Source: Census 2002.The DTO has informed me that there are several factors that are likely to account for the observed decline in cycling to work and school. These include: an increase in rates of car ownership, which has been very significant over the period nationally and in the greater Dublin area; growth in road traffic, creating a perception among potential cyclists of a more dangerous cycling environment; a relatively hostile cycling environment in many new residential and employment areas; longer average trip lengths to work as a result of the spread of development; and more safety-conscious culture, particularly among parents and teachers.However, it is worth noting that falling trends in the GDA are not as pronounced as for other Irish cities. Cycle numbers to work and to school fell in every major city in the State between 1996 and 2002, but the GDA's reduction in the six years, and especially County Dublin's reduction, is lower than others. One possible explanation for this is that the investment in infrastructure has slowed the erosion of cycling mode share that would otherwise have occurred due to the above factors.As regards value for money, I pointed out in my reply to a parliamentary question, reference 21206/05, on 22 June 2005 that my Department proposes to undertake an expenditure review of the traffic management grants scheme, including the Exchequer assistance for cycle facilities, commencing in late 2005. This is part of the ongoing expenditure review initiative, in which all Departments participate. The purpose of these reviews is to evaluate the effectiveness of the relevant public expenditure.

Loganair has been awarded the contract for air services on the Knock and Derry routes.The total maximum contracted subvention for the three-year contract term for the provision of air services on all six routes is €45.8 million. Based on projected passenger numbers and the maximum subvention levels specified in the new contracts, the average subvention per passenger, per flight, in respect of each route would be calculated as follows: Derry — Dublin, €78; Donegal — Dublin, €62; Sligo — Dublin, €51; Knock — Dublin, €87; Galway — Dublin, €37; and Kerry — Dublin, €28.Loganair and Aer Arann have provided a high quality service under the PSO programme to date and I am confident this will continue under these new contracts. The continuation of Government support for regional air services will have a very positive impact on regional development through increased economic activity, tourism and employment.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides that a county or city manager may make a road works speed limit order for the application of a speed limit on any road or part of a road, including a motorway, where road works are being carried out. A road works speed limit order can be applied for any period of not more than 12 months and the minimum speed limit that may be put in place by such an order is 30 km/h.Before making an order under section 10, a manager must give notice of the proposal to the Garda Commissioner and consider any representations made by the Commissioner. The consent of the National Roads Authority must be given in respect of any proposals to apply a road works speed limit on any part of a national road or a motorway. Notice of the making of a road works speed limit order must be published in one or more newspapers in circulation in the county or city where the road in respect of which the order is to have effect is located.Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides for the application through the making of by-laws by the elected members of county and city councils of special speed limits in lieu of the speed limits that apply on a default basis to roads and motorways. The section also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines to county and city councils in relation to the making of special speed limit by-laws. I issued such guidelines on 18 April and they include a specific reference to the deployment of speed limits at road works. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be viewed on my Department's website.

Earlier estimates of the amount of the operating deficit also had to be revised to take account of higher than expected costs for maintenance of trams, infrastructure and ticket machines and of insurance costs more than doubling.It is expected that an operational subsidy will be required until 2006 and that the total subsidy required for 2004, 2005 and 2006 will be €7.1 million. This estimate assumes that the current relationship between costs and revenues will be maintained to negate the impact of inflation. It is expected that the requirement for an operational subsidy will cease after 2006.

Work on the restoration of the remaining 20 miles is in progress with a view to reopening the navigation in early 2008.I have provided for an allocation of €11 million per annum up to 2007 to Waterways Ireland to cover capital works in the South under my Department's capital programme. I am satisfied that there is sufficient funding within this allocation to allow Waterways Ireland to complete the programme of reopening the Royal Canal to the Shannon.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1098	A delegation from the Carra, Mask and Corrib water protection group met on 24 November 2004 with the responsible Ministers, including myself and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Following the meeting, arrangements were put in place for officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my Department and Coillte Teoranta to meet with the local group to discuss their concerns and proposals in more detail. Contact continues between the group and Coillte Teoranta regarding forestry practices in the area.I am advised that forestry comprises only a small percentage of the land area in the catchment of Lough Corrib and Lough Carra and there is no scientific evidence available which suggests that forestry policy and practices have a significant environmental impact on these important lakes. However, a full review of the relationship between the afforestation and water quality generally has commenced under the auspices of one managing authority for the western river basin district and my Department, is closely involved in this review.Forestry is already a very regulated sector. All forestry operations in Ireland must be carried out in full compliance with the code of best forest practice and a suite of environmental and forestry practice guidelines, which include forestry and water quality and forest harvesting. The code and guidelines outline best practices and procedures to mitigate against any potential negative effects of forestry operations on water quality and the environment.In addition, further regulation is provided through SI 538 of 2001, which introduced a statutory consent system with regard to initial afforestation. As part of the standard grant application process, appropriate proposed afforestation sites are assessed vis-à-vis water quality, designated habitats, archaeology, landscape and other environmental conditions, and are referred to the relevant prescribed body according to an agreed protocol. These bodies include regional fisheries boards, local authorities, the national parks and wildlife service, national monuments and An Taisce. The regulations also provide for public consultation through notice of the proposed afforestation printed in local press and submissions or observations invited.

There have been a series of discussions with the Commission and I understand that the revised programme will be sent to the Commission shortly.The nitrates action programme will apply from 1 January 2006 on a national basis and will include measures on the timing and procedures for the land application of fertilisers, limits on the land application of fertilisers, requirements on the capacity of storage vessels for livestock manure and general provisions on storage management. It will also provide for the monitoring of the effectiveness of these measures.

Category A caters for farmers who inherit, lease or otherwise receive free of charge or for a nominal consideration a holding from a farmer who retired or died, as the case maybe, before the closing date for receipt of the single payment application in 2005 and that holding was leased by the previous owner to a third party during the reference period. Category D caters for farmers who are new entrants to farming since the reference period. They must have commenced their farming activity after 31 December 2002 or during 2002 without having received direct payments in respect of that year.In view of the tragic circumstances of this case, my Department will now accept an application to the national reserve from the second person named to replace that of his late son. If he has not retired from farming and has not been farming during the past five years, he may be eligible to apply to the reserve under category D. I have arranged for an application form to be sent to him for completion. I should point out that he would not be eligible to apply under category A as it was he who decided to lease out his land during the reference years.In the event that he does submit an application, the second person named will be notified of his eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	As the Deputy is probably aware, this event occurred during July 2002, almost three years ago, and involved the slaughter on-farm by the herdowner of some 4,000 pigs over a five-day period. A five-minute video, reportedly commissioned by the herdowner, was brought to the attention of the Department by the media. The Department on Friday last requested a copy of the video from the journalist who had shown it to officials, so far no copy has been received.Following the discovery by Department veterinary inspectors of quantities of carbadox on the farm and an admission by the herdowner that he had spread the substance on the floors of pig pens, the movement of any animals from this herd — except under specific licence from the Department — had been prohibited by the Department in the period preceding slaughter in order to protect public health. Carbadox is a carcinogen — cancer-causing substance — which is banned by the EU and deemed to be unsafe at any level. Prosecutions have since been issued against the herdowner, alleging a range of offences relating to the use of this feed additive and other matters, including the illegal movement of pigs from the farm. The herdowner has issued proceedings against the Department under two headings.While there was no question of permitting the pigs to be slaughtered for human consumption, the Department wrote to the herdowner's solicitors on 7 May 2002 explicitly stating its willingness to allow him to pursue the option of his making arrangements, acceptable to the Department, with a dedicated plant for their slaughter. However, he elected not to pursue this option. Instead, he sought permission to slaughter the pigs himself on his farm on welfare grounds. He had discussed this approach with Department veterinary inspectors and they are satisfied that he understood fully what would be involved and that he displayed both the competence and confidence to undertake the task.During the five-day period, two veterinary inspectors, including an animal welfare expert, from the Department visited the farm on numerous occasions in order to assess the ongoing slaughter operation. At no stage did he express concerns or disquiet on animal welfare grounds with regard to the slaughter method or seek to suspend operations on grounds of professed animal welfare concerns. A non-veterinary official of the Department was present on the farm during the five-day period in question, whose primary function was ensuring proper disposal of the carcases, that is, to ensure they did not enter the human food chain.The circumstances in this case were highly unusual. On-farm slaughter of animals in any number is an exception rather than the rule and occurs only in extreme circumstances, for example, the FMD outbreak in Cooley, where it is not possible to move the animals to a dedicated slaughter plant or where there are compelling reasons, for example, fear of disease spread, for not attempting to so do. In this particular case, the herdowner had decided to slaughter his animals on farm and the Department considered at the time that it could not legally have forced him to have the operation conducted in a slaughter plant. The approach which the Department generally employs in circumstances in which it proves necessary to have numbers of animals slaughtered — for example, cattle, where BSE is detected — is to have slaughter carried out in a dedicated slaughter plant.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders. This is not unique to Ireland. The number of violent deaths — murder and manslaughter — recorded in 2004 is 45, the lowest number recorded in ten years, despite our population increasing by 400,000 during the same period. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by the Garda Síochána to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his functions and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions. Furthermore, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions also.As the Deputy will be also aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently at Second Stage in the House, provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, I propose to bring forward, on Committee Stage of the Bill, a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearm offences, including the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases. I am also introducing a new offence of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence. My full range of proposals will be announced in the House in the normal way in due course.YearRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictions19984321199912775200012652200194222002104322003201041*20049651*20059110*Figures for 2004 and 2005 are operational and liable to change.

Under this scheme, young people arrested for drugs offences, or offences believed to be related to drug misuse, in the Garda Dublin north central division are offered the opportunity of voluntary referral to local health services regarding their possible drug misuse. During 2003, my Department provided funding of €20,000 to the north inner city local drug task force to commission research into the operation of arrest referral schemes, including an examination of the operation of the above pilot scheme. The research study was publicly launched on April 11 2005 by my colleague, the Minister for State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Noel Ahern. I understand that the findings of the study, including proposals for the appropriate development of the pilot scheme, will now be brought forward by the north inner city local drugs task force for consideration by the parties involved in the current pilot scheme.

I also receive regular security briefings from the Garda authorities in respect of this and other matters. These security briefings fully confirm the findings of the Independent Monitoring Commission.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1111	I presume the Deputy is referring to the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and to recent exchanges at the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in the context of consideration by that committee of my Department's Estimates for 2005.The Deputy's question refers selectively to comments made during those proceedings in which I outlined the comprehensive nature of the resources being allocated annually across Departments and agencies to support the asylum process which in 2004 amounted to some €375 million. Some €125 million of this expenditure was made by my Department in supporting asylum and immigration related services such as the processing of asylum applications, provision of legal advice and representation by the Refugee Legal Service, provision of accommodation to asylum seekers on a countrywide basis and the operation of the immigration system, including the deportation process.At the committee, I also referred to the major improvements which have been made both with regard to the reduction in timescales for processing asylum applications and the reduction in the number of such applications on hands in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT. This is illustrated, for example, by the major improvements made in reducing processing timescales with asylum applications from prioritised countries — Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa — and having current average processing times of 14 working days at first instance and ten working days at appeals stage. Applications from the countries in question cover some 46% of total applications for refugee status. Other improvements include the elimination of the backlog of asylum applications with fewer than 3,000 cases awaiting a decision now as compared to some 5,414 cases at the end of May 2004 and some 10,000 cases in 2000; and the fact that there are only some 700 cases awaiting an asylum decision over six months old as compared to some 6,500 such cases in September 2001.The allocation of such a comprehensive level of resources by the State, along with the very great improvements which have been achieved in the reduction in processing times and the number of applications on hands, point very clearly to both our commitment to continuing to meet our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and the success of our asylum strategy.As I pointed out in a statement, which I issued on 7 June 2005 setting out the real facts about the asylum and deportation systems, our approach to the issue of protection is based on achieving a balance between fairness and firmness — fairness in ensuring that those genuinely in need of protection receive that protection quickly and firmness in dealing with abuses in our system which tie up large amounts of public funds which could be better utilised elsewhere. The State's asylum strategy is based on a number of key principles: meeting our obligations under international law such as the 1951 Geneva Convention and, of course, under national law relating asylum; dealing fairly but efficiently with the large number of unfounded asylum claims which are being received which represent over 90% of the total number of asylum applications being processed annually; ensuring that persons who are found, after a fair and efficient determination process, not to need protection are returned to their countries of origin as quickly as this can be arranged; and ensuring that we have robust systems in place to root out and prevent abuse in our protection system by persons who are entering the State for purposes other than seeking protection from persecution.However, as I pointed out to the select committee, I will not shirk from my responsibilities to protect our refugee protection system from abuse. The level of such abuse is well illustrated not only by the nature of some of the grounds being put forward for protection but also by the level of non-co-operation which exists with the asylum and immigration authorities. Despite the comprehensive nature and fairness of our independent asylum process, involving a determination at first instance and appeal by two independent agencies and access to comprehensive legal advice and interpretation services, some 90% of applicants for asylum are found not to be in need of refugee status.A recent analysis by my Department of the accelerated processing arrangements for prioritised asylum applications introduced on 25 January 2005, which involves a full merits consideration by ORAC at first instance and access to an appeal to the RAT, indicated that of the 365 decisions issued by ORAC up to the week ending 27 May 2005, some 359 were refusals and of 136 decisions issued by RAT, some 134 upheld the determination of the ORAC.Our recognition rates at first instance compares favourably to other European countries as follows: Denmark, 4.9%; Ireland, 6.2%; Spain,2.6%; Norway, 3.6%; Germany, 3.3% and the United Kingdom, 3%. It must also be recognised that many of those claiming refugee status in the State do not comply with their statutory obligations to co-operate with the immigration and asylum authorities.The analysis of the accelerated process introduced in January last also shows that some 33% of applicants are not complying with their daily reporting requirements to the Reception and Integration Agency. Similarly, some 46% of those who have failed the asylum process and who are seeking leave to remain in the State have not complied with their daily signing requirement with the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Many applicants are also not in possession of travel and identity documentation even though a travel document is essential in order to be allowed access to an aircraft to travel to the State by air. For the period May 2004 to May 2005, some 88% of the 1,174 Nigerian nationals without documents stated to ORAC that they travelled by air at some stage in their journey. Large numbers of other nationals are also arriving without travel documents but indicate to ORAC that they travelled by air, as follows: Romania, 40%; Democratic Republic of the Congo, 100%; Ukraine, 42% and Moldova, 33%. Recognising that there will always be some people with genuine protection needs who have to flee their countries of origin without their identity documents, the fact remains that with no direct flights between the countries I mentioned and Ireland, the inescapable conclusion is that destruction and concealment of travel documents is a central feature of a well developed trafficking strategy.The State will continue to meet its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention to those genuinely needing protection. However, I also intend to continue to intensify the drive against unfounded asylum applications. The processing of applications will continue to be speeded up consistent with fairness and due process and every effort will continue to be made to ensure that applicants comply with their duty to co-operate and report. Persons found to have no protection needs will be returned to their countries of origin as quickly as this can be arranged. The need for a comprehensive repatriation strategy in the circumstances I have outlined, is recognised by all States with developed asylum systems and by the UNHCR.

This scheme has been developed in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The purpose of the scheme is to support local communities who wish to install and maintain CCTV security systems in their area, with the aim of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. Under this scheme, individual communities will be able to avail of grant aid funding of up to €100,000 from my Department to install a CCTV system in their area.I am also delighted to say that further to discussions between our respective Departments, my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cúiv, has given a commitment to provide successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of €100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding €200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser. These CCTV systems will have to be installed to a high-end technical specification and operated in compliance with a strict code of practice. Access to these CCTV systems will also have to be given to the Garda Síochána as required.The scheme is being managed on behalf my Department by Area Development Management Ltd, ADM. Communities that are not ready to apply for full scheme funding may apply for pre-development supports to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals which will have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability. Full details of the scheme, together with the relevant application forms and guidelines, are available on my Department's website:  http://www.justice.ie, or the ADM website: http://www.adm.ie. They are also available directly from ADM, Holbrook House, Holles Street, Dublin 2. Any queries about this scheme should be directed to ADM at telephone: 01-2400700; fax: 01-6610411 or e-mail: enquiries@adm.ie.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1115	As the Deputy is aware, Ennis is one of 17 locations nationwide which has been selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme of implementation of CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase one — Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 — Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; and phase three — Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo.Phase one has been completed in five of the six locations. Installation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process and the Garda authorities have been giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. I believe that the proposed redesign of the tender document provides an opportunity to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest possible extent, making use not only of the technical but of the project management expertise in the private sector. In that regard, I asked the Garda Commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.As a first step in this process, the Garda authorities have placed a request for tender document on the Government e-tenders website seeking tenders for consultancy services for the procurement, supply and implementation of town centre CCTV systems to the Garda Síochána. A total of six tender proposals have been received and are currently being evaluated. In order to procure the most rapid delivery of these systems, the Garda Síochána is endeavouring to establish the most appropriate procurement model available. This process will involve the successful tenderer examining all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including: installation, operation and management of systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff with regard to the town scheme and Garda station premises; and assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda Síochána.The successful tenderer must also examine and recommend which procurement model is considered to be the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. It is the ambition of the Garda Síochána to maximise outsourcing of all processes in making Garda town centre CCTV systems available in the most efficient and effective manner.

He subsequently sought to invoke European Union law on free movement to have that order set aside on the basis of his marriage to an EU national worker. Following consideration of the relevant provisions as enshrined in Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, the application was refused as the EU national was not working in the State.The European Court of Justice has acknowledged that Article 1 of Directive 93/96 allows member states to require of students who are nationals of a different member state and who wish to exercise the right of residence on their territory that they satisfy the relevant national authority, by means of a declaration, that they have sufficient resources to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance system of the host member state during their period of residence. Furthermore, where a member state takes the view that a student who has recourse to social assistance no longer fulfils the conditions of his right of residence, it may take measures, within the limits imposed by Community law, either to withdraw his residence permit or not to renew it. In addition the person in question must have sufficient resources to support his non-EEA national spouse. Thus, it would appear on the basis of the information available that the provisions in question are not applicable.

The application in question was to enable the wife of a non-EEA national employed under the employment permit scheme travel to the State to reside with him. A worker employed under the employment permit scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds.Following examination and assessment of the application by a visa officer of my Department, it was determined that the supporting documentation did not show that the worker in question was in a position to fully support his wife. Consequently, the application was refused on 13 June 2005 on grounds of insufficient finances. It is open to the applicant to appeal this decision in writing within two months of receipt of the decision to refuse the application. Any appeal should be accompanied by appropriate additional documentation that the applicant feels will address the reasons for refusal given.

The disbursement of funding to support victims of crime is now a matter for the new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime. The commission is an independent body established in March 2005 with a remit to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and disburse funding for victim support measures.I am advised that the commission has received over 60 applications for funding for measures to support victims of crime in response to a public advertisement and that these include a number of applications from separate groupings within Victim Support, some of which are no longer associated with that body. The commission will examine each application on its merits and will make an independent decision with regard to eligibility for funding.It should be noted that I decided to terminate funding of Victim Support with effect from 31 March 2005 because of reductions in service levels and concerns with regard to governance, accountability and value for money arising from ongoing internal difficulties in that organisation. An independent review carried out early in 2005 concluded that the organisation was terminally damaged. My Department agreed to make a final allocation to Victim Support in respect of expenditure up to 31 March this year, on production of relevant accounts, subject to verification by the Department. Material was received from Victim Support in this regard on 31 May 2005 and that is currently under examination in my Department. Victim Support is aware that the commission is not in a position to consider its application for funding until these matters have been concluded to my satisfaction and until I am in a position to advise the commission that issues of accountability for public funds already allocated to Victim Support have been resolved.I should reiterate that the commission will make an independent decision with regard to funding on the merits of each proposal it has received. I might add that the commission has recently allocated its first tranche of funding for measures to support crime victims. A sum of €50,000 was allocated to the Rape Crisis Network for court accompaniment for victims of rape and sexual assault and a sum of €28,000 was allocated to Women's Aid for court accompaniment for victims of domestic violence.

The services provided by the RLS include assistance with regard to judicial review of recommendations of the Office of Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC; decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, or with regard to leave to remain applications or deportation orders.The Legal Aid Board, including the RLS, provides services in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the regulations made thereunder. Any applications for legal aid, including those by asylum seekers, must satisfy both the financial and merits criteria set out in this legislation. The merits criteria relate to the prospects for success of the case. These include the following requirements: that the proceedings are such that a reasonably prudent person would be likely to seek such services at their own expense; that a solicitor or barrister acting reasonably would be likely to advise him or her to obtain such services at their own expense; that there are reasonable grounds in law for instituting proceedings; that the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful; that the proceedings represent the only appropriate remedy; and that it is otherwise reasonable to grant a certificate having regard to all the circumstances of the case.Any person applying to the RLS for service is also subject to the financial eligibility criteria and payment of the appropriate financial contribution, which is as follows: an advice fee, currently a minimum of €6, payable by all applicants and an additional aid fee, currently a minimum of €29, payable by those in receipt of legal aid, that is, proceedings before a court or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The aid fee may be waived but there is no provision to waive the €6 advice fee. Applicants may register with the RLS at any stage of the asylum process — initial application, appeal stage and post asylum — with regard to matters such as applications for humanitarian leave to remain.

The death was fully investigated by the Garda Síochána. This included a visit to the scene by a scene of crime examiner before the body of the deceased was removed and an examination of the deceased's car. All known witnesses were interviewed also. The evidence from the investigation would suggest that the death was as a result of an accident.I am further informed that as a result of representations made by members of the deceased's family, a review of the initial investigation was carried out by a detective superintendent. This review did not reveal anything to suggest that the death had not been accidental. In addition, the State pathologist was consulted and agreed with the findings of the pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination on the deceased's body at Letterkenny General Hospital.A coroner's inquest was held on 5 September 2003 and the jury returned a verdict that death was in accordance with medical evidence and that the deceased had died from drowning. I have no reason to believe that this incident was not fully and comprehensively investigated and I am therefore of the view on the current facts that there would be no benefit to be gained by reopening the investigation at this time.

The unit currently deals with approximately 100,000 vetting applications per annum. Although the groups referred to by the Deputy cannot currently avail of this vetting regime, these will be covered by a planned phased extension of Garda vetting arrangements to all relevant sectors and groups. I am pleased to state that this extension will commence later this year, as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place, and public announcements will occur in this regard in due course.

One of these directives, Directive 2004/57/EC, has passed its deadline for transposition. It is anticipated that this directive will be transposed later this year by way of a Statutory Instrument under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. Three of the directives listed below are Schengen-related measures and as such, the deadlines for transposition apply to Schengen member states only. Ireland is not a Schengen member state. However, following the Council decision of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, Ireland must transpose these measures before the Council can take a decision approving Ireland’s implementation of these aspects of the Schengen acquis. Work is under way to prepare the necessary legislation to transpose the directives into Irish law. The remaining three directives have deadlines in 2006 and 2007. Work is also under way to allow for their transposition into domestic legislation.NumberTitlePurposeTransposition deadlineExpected date of transposition2004/57/ECCommission Directive 2004/57/EC of 23 April 2004 on the identification of pyrotechnic articles and certain ammunition for the purposes of Council Directive 93/15/EEC on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil usesDirective 93/15/EEC applies to explosive materials and articles which are considered to be such in the United Nations Recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods and which fall within Class 1 of those recommendations. Pyrotechnic articles, however, are expressly excluded from the scope of that Directive. Consequently, in order to ensure the uniform application of Directive 93/15/EEC throughout the Community, it is necessary to identify, by reference to the relevant United Nations recommendations, articles which are to be considered to be pyrotechnic in nature. So that it is clear precisely what Directive 93/15/EEC covers, Directive 2004/57/EC lists 1) the articles in the UN recommendations considered to be pyrotechnic or ammunitions and 2) those Articles in respect of which a determination is required as to whether those Articles are pyrotechnic articles or explosives.31/12/20042005 It is proposed to transpose the Directive into Irish law by way of Statutory Instrument under Section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972. A draft instrument has been prepared within the Department and has been forwarded to the Attorney General’s Office for formal drafting.2004/38/ECDirective 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC.The Directive lays down the conditions governing the exercise of the right of free movement and residence within the territory of the Member States by Union citizens and their family members; the right of permanent residence in the territory of the Member States for Union citizens and their family members; the limits placed on the rights above on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.30/04/200620062004/83/ECDirective 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on the minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection grantedThe purpose of this Directive is to lay down minimum standards for the qualification of third country nationals or stateless person as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted. The main objective of this Directive is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection, and, on the other hand, to ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States.10/10/2006Summer 2006

I am further informed that the Garda Síochána maintains contact with other police forces through established channels which provide for the structured exchange of intelligence on matters, particularly with regard to organised crime and criminals.Members of the Garda Síochána participate in many international fora with regard to organised crime. Four Garda liaison officers are permanently based in major European capitals. These officers facilitate inquiries relating to significant criminal investigations which have connections with this jurisdiction. There are also members of the Garda Síochána seconded to Europol and Interpol. Europol is the intelligence co-ordination agency for all European law enforcement organisations and members of the Garda Síochána actively participate at all levels in its activities. Where intelligence is available regarding the location and activities of Irish criminals abroad, this intelligence is disseminated to the relevant police authorities through Interpol or Europol.The exchange of evidence for criminal prosecutions between jurisdictions is governed by international conventions; currently all exchanges are subject of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 — Part VII. The Garda Síochána continues to actively participate in extensive, formal, informal and bilateral relationships with police forces and order law enforcement agencies throughout the world. It is continuously developing its support services in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies.The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is continually adapting to new challenges in relation to targeting Irish crime gangs here and overseas. The bureau regularly assesses the effectiveness of new legislation and implementing strategies that will efficiently combat organised crime to facilitate responses to emerging trends.

These investigations will, in most cases, follow from earlier criminal investigations. The seizure of assets in criminal investigations or proceedings is carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions under separate provisions.The Criminal Assets Bureau takes actions under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as amended, to seize property which is shown, in the High Court, to be the proceeds of crime. Since 1996, the total value of orders obtained under section 3 of the aforementioned Act is €14,145,245, Stg£2,830,175 and US$5,472,747. The bureau continues to pursue its statutory functions and it will target the proceeds of criminal conduct and seize the proceeds of such activity.The amendments in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 have enhanced the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in this regard through allowing for the disposal of assets by agreement with relevant parties before the end of the seven-year waiting period established as a safeguard for disposal orders in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.

My concern with regard to door management was one of the reasons I brought forward legislation to regulate the private security industry. The Private Security Authority, which was established in October 2004, will commence a phased rollout of licensing of the private security industry in October 2005. I understand that the authority proposes to commence licensing contractors providing door supervisor and security guarding services.The authority has put in place stringent criteria to protect the industry from infiltration by criminals. All licence applicants will undergo criminal records checking by the Garda Síochána. This will apply to employees, principals and directors of private security companies. Contractors supplying private security services will be required to provide valid tax clearance certificates. The authority has contracted the National Standards Authority of Ireland to develop a suite of standards for each sector of the industry. Compliance with these standards will also be a prerequisite for the issuance of a contractor's licence. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána is continually monitoring developments in the security industry to ensure, in so far as is possible, that all breaches of criminal law are detected.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1143	The Government's approach continues to support the underlying principles of the Children Act 2001 — namely, that prevention through early intervention is desirable, that detention should be used a last resort and that diversion and community sanctions should be available and used wherever appropriate.There is a well-acknowledged recognition of the need to join up strategy and operation of services for children, and this is reflected in the cross-cutting and interdependent nature of the Children Act 2001. The Act has established a sound statutory framework for a modern youth justice system, but I believe there is merit in reviewing the institutional and strategic environment in which it is to operate. To this end, I established a project team in my Department to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the delivery of the State's services in the area of youth justice.The project team has consulted widely with the statutory bodies which are involved in the delivery of services to young offenders and to young people who are considered to be at risk of offending. The project team has consulted closely with the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, in particular. The team has also consulted with a broad spectrum of non-governmental service providers, community interests and other experts active in the youth justice sector. I expect the team to report to me shortly.Due to the fact that the Children Act is a complex and comprehensive piece of legislation, its provisions are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment. The Act gives a statutory basis to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, when the relevant sections in Part 4 of the Act were commenced in May 2002. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level. Part 4 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. The community sanction provisions are largely a matter for the probation and welfare service of my Department to implement. In line with this, provision is being made by the probation and welfare service to allow for the commencement, on a phased basis, of the remaining sections of the Act relevant to the probation and welfare service.Currently, young offenders coming before the courts may be placed under the supervision of the probation and welfare service in accordance with section 2 of the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 — probation orders — or section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 — in the case of those aged 16 years or over.Since May 2002, a restriction on movement order — sections 133-136 of the Children Act — may be imposed. In addition, since July 2004, courts can order that a family conference be arranged by the probation and welfare service with all interested parties in a case so that an action plan can be drawn up in the individual case. The child concerned must have acknowledged his or her culpability and the action plan must come back to court for approval. If the child complies with the elements of the action plan, the court may, at the end of the period covered by the plan, dismiss the charge or charges.A pilot mentor project — sections 131-132 — is due to commence very shortly in the north Dublin area. The programme will serve as a model for the development of the mentor — family support — order. Recruitment of staff for this new and innovative project has taken place with the employment of a co-ordinator and administrator. The programme will recruit volunteers who will act as mentors to young people who have been before the courts and are under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. It is envisaged that parental supervision orders — sections 112-113 — will be commenced on a pilot basis later this year.Other provisions under the Act require capital investment prior to commencement for buildings, equipment and expanding programmes. Work is already under way regarding some of these provisions, details of which are as follows. In regard to a day centre order — Part 9, sections 118-123 — a new probation office which is due to open in Cork very shortly will have provision for meeting the requirements of the day centre order. The development of a similar provision for the Tallaght area has been incorporated into plans for the new Tallaght probation and welfare service office which is expected to be completed in 2006. In regard to a probation — training or activities programme — order — Part 9, section 124 — the probation and welfare service has identified programmes already being funded through the service that meet the service requirements under this sanction. In addition, the service is also working towards the development of additional facilities suitable for use. In regard to a probation — intensive supervision — order — Part 9, section 125 — preliminary meetings have taken place to explore the feasibility of establishing two pilot intensive supervision programmes in Cork and Dublin, utilising existing intensive probation supervision projects. Preparatory work is ongoing in this regard. In regard to a probation — residential supervision — order — part 9, sections 126 to 127 — it is envisaged that this section will commence later this year. A document has been prepared outlining standards for probation and welfare service-funded hostels. In preparation for meeting these standards, staff of hostels will require training and development. Work is under way to identify suitable training which will meet these needs and training will be organised for staff over the coming months. In addition, Cork probation hostel is being extended and refurbished to meet the required standards and this hostel is expected to reopen very shortly. In regard to a suitable person — care and supervision — order — Part 9, sections 129 to 130 — this order will require the same rigorous recruitment, screening and training elements as outlined in the standards on practices and procedures in foster care. Suitable persons will have to be recruited and trained. Work on implementation of this order is expected to commence early next year. In regard to a dual order — Part 9, sections 137 to 139 — this sanction will be developed, on a phased basis, as day centres become available.In addition, there are in existence a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects. Funding of €5.471 million has been allocated to these and other related projects in the current year. The Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all situations, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turn in the process of maturing into young adults. Moreover, research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 88% do not come to the attention of the Garda Síochána again by their 18th birthday.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1145	As the Deputy will be aware, the control of operational matters is an issue for the Garda Síochána. I wish to inform the Deputy that there are a number of multi-disciplinary and inter-departmental structures in place which facilitate an integrated and co-ordinated approach to tackling and-or preventing serious and organised crime including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the institutional structures created under the national drugs strategy and the money laundering contact steering committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance.The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda national drug unit, operating under the Assistant Commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively.Moreover, a broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda Síochána to confront organised crime. Our criminal legislative framework which reflects international developments in response to the global growth of organised crime and specific issues within our own domestic situation, is kept under continuous review.The Private Security Services Act 2004 was signed into law on 4 May 2004. This Act allows for, inter alia, the establishment of a Private Security Authority to control and supervise persons providing security services and to maintain and improve standards in the provision by them of those services. The functions of the authority include the granting and renewal of licences, the issuing of identity cards to licences, the suspension or revocation of licences, the specification of standards in the provision of security services, the specification of qualifications and training requirements and monitoring of the services and service providers in the industry generally.The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 was signed into law earlier this year. This Act substantially bolsters the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the continuing battle to target the proceeds of all types of crime and will extend those powers to the proceeds of white-collar crime and corruption. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently on Second Stage in the House, provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences. Part 3 of the Bill makes provision for the admissibility as evidence in court of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements. Proposed amendments to the Bill which are under consideration include, among others, proposals to provide for criminal offences with regard to participation in a criminal organisation.Ireland also has extensive legislation in place to tackle money laundering activities. The main provisions in Irish law relating to money laundering are set out in section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended. This Act allows for the designation of certain bodies and persons for anti-money laundering purposes and for the prescribing of certain activities for the purpose of anti-money laundering. The Act requires that, when providing certain specified services, designated bodies and persons are obliged to identify customers and retain certain records. In addition designated bodies and persons must report to the Garda Síochána any suspicion that a money laundering offence has been or is being committed with regard to their business.The Act also requires designated bodies to adopt measures to prevent and detect the commission of a money laundering offence including, inter alia, the establishment of appropriate internal preventative and detection procedures and the provision of appropriate training of employees, directors and officers. A money laundering steering committee established under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance oversees this aspect of the legislation.As the Deputy will also be aware, Operation Anvil was initiated by the Garda Commissioner in the Dublin metropolitan region in May this year. This operation is an intelligence-led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints, and by uniform mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols.In addition to this, overt patrolling intelligence-led covert operations are also being undertaken in the course of Operation Anvil involving local units and personnel from national Garda investigative units. This operation is being run in conjunction with regular policing activities. The Garda authorities have assured me that combating organised crime will remain at the forefront of its operational activities and my Department will, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, continue to review the situation to ensure that organised crime is tackled effectively.

While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to six per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. In interpreting these figures, account must also to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.With regard to the extent of the number of prosecutions, as the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his function and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions. Furthermore, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions also.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following tables show the robbery offences where a firearm was involved for each Garda district in the Carlow-Kildare division from 2000 to 2004.Garda districtRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictionsBaltinglass1000Carlow4100Kildare4110Naas10310*Statistics for 2004 are provisional/operational and liable to change.Garda districtRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictionsBaltinglass2000Carlow2110Kildare3110Naas3210Garda districtRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictionsBaltinglass3110Carlow3211Kildare1000Naas5110Garda districtRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictionsBaltinglass0000Carlow4210Kildare0000Naas3100Garda districtRecordedDetectedProceedings commencedConvictionsBaltinglass0000Carlow3111Kildare3110Naas2100

Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1157	The toll of deaths and serious injuries on our roads is a cause of serious concern for me. Huge strides have been made by the Government in improving the safety on our roads by building new ones, upgrading existing ones and setting appropriate speed limits. Unfortunately, the fact remains that all too many road users do not act responsibly in their use of the roads. In these circumstances, the Garda Síochána must give a high priority to enforcing the law with regard to road users. One of the strategic goals in the Government Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 and the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy 2005-2007 is reducing the incidence of fatal and serious injury collisions. There are significant developments under way in this area.Last November I announced the establishment by the commissioner of a Garda traffic corps. The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government. As each cycle of recruit training is completed, the Garda Commissioner will assign these new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities, which include the traffic corps. I am informed that the strength of the Garda traffic corps over the next four years will be as set out hereunder:YearNumber2005563200680520071,03020081,200The traffic corps will reach its planned staffing complement in 2008. I also published the Garda strategic review of traffic policing last November. The strategic review is a blueprint for a transformation in the enforcement of road traffic law. A key recommendation of the strategic review is that a new position of assistant commissioner in charge of all aspects of road traffic law should be created. The Government subsequently approved the appointment of Mr. Eddie Rock as assistant commissioner and the Commissioner then gave him responsibility for traffic matters including the traffic corps. Assistant Commissioner Rock is a member of the top management team in the force and brings authority and visible leadership to the traffic corps from the outset. He has been tasked with implementing the recommendations contained in the strategic review of traffic policing.The Government has also approved a new road safety strategy for the period 2004-06. The strategy proposes that 11.1 million vehicle speeding checks be carried out per year by the end of the strategy. In order to enable this target to be achieved, the strategy proposes that the Garda Síochána enter into arrangements for the engagement of a private sector concern for the purpose of the provision and operation of a nationwide programme for the detection of speeding offences. The strategy makes clear that the overall performance criteria to be applied to the outsourced detection of speeding offences would be determined by the Garda Síochána and camera detection facilities would be used at locations where the Garda Síochána determines there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. The purpose of the initiative will be to increase road safety and thereby reduce death and injuries, not increase revenue. Outsourcing of the operation of camera equipment would enable the Garda to withdraw from non-core policing matters and so would free up Garda resources for enforcement purposes, thus allowing gardaí to concentrate on detections requiring direct interception, such as driving while intoxicated.A working group chaired by my Department, and consisting of representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority has reported to me and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, on how the provision, operation and processing of the output of speed cameras might operate. We expect to bring proposals to Government shortly. I am informed by the Garda authorities that each Garda division has identified 30 locations, utilising internal and external sources of information, where specific intercept enforcement can be conducted with a view to reducing deaths and injuries on our roads. Priority is given to the prevention and detection of drink driving, seat belt, speeding and road transport-road haulage offences. An ongoing monthly schedule of enforcement and visibility measures at 30 locations is being implemented. Locations and schedules are varied where appropriate.In addition, co-ordinated national corridor operations are being conducted to ensure visibility and visible enforcement along national routes. National co-ordinated operations are also conducted targeting drink driving, where the focus is on access and egress routes to and from selected urban centres, and heavy goods vehicles, where the focus is on road transport-road haulage offences. I am further informed by the Garda Síochána that other road traffic initiatives are also undertaken locally based on local intelligence and available internal and external sources of information.

Bus Éireann has 650 large buses and two mini-buses. It contracts out 462, 450 and 1,213 large buses, medium buses and mini-buses respectively. Contractor cars number 255. The above figures were extracted by Bus Éireann from the October 2004 census.Bus Éireann school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor and may be subject to ongoing medical review. All Bus Éireann school bus drivers must hold a current driving licence appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. The company also provides training to bring drivers up to the requisite standard, if necessary. In addition, Bus Éireann school bus drivers must pass a driving assessment conducted by specially trained and qualified Bus Éireann inspectors. Vehicle familiarisation with different types of school buses is carried out on an ongoing basis. Bus Éireann school bus drivers have also attended a disability awareness training course, especially designed to take account of the requirements of children with special needs who travel under the school transport scheme. This course is ongoing at the present.Contractor school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor and may be subject to ongoing medical review by the chief medical officer of CIE. It is a condition of the contract agreement that no persons shall be allowed to drive a school bus if having been requested, they refuse to submit themselves for medical examination or if they are certified unfit. All contractors must hold a current driving licence appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. Bus Éireann maintains a record of driving licences on file for all nominated contractor school bus drivers.Bus Éireann extended the disability awareness training course for its own personnel to include contractors and their school bus drivers who drive services under the school transport scheme for children with special needs. This training course is ongoing at present. Contractors, as independent private bus operators, may at their own discretion provide additional training for their employees.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1162	I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 246 together.As the Deputies are aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures to cater for children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. The general allocation for the school in question is one full-time teaching post and ten part-time hours. The school may also retain 2.5 part-time hours under transitional arrangements.I can confirm that the school contacted my Department with a proposal to retain additional resource teaching posts in the school. My officials recently agreed a position with the school authorities resulting in the retention of extra resource teaching posts through a combination of general allocation hours, low incidence hours and also transitional hours. Liaison with the school is ongoing in this regard. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure all their needs are met.Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others do better when taught in small groups. Often, it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child. I can confirm that the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will meet with the school authorities in the coming days to discuss a number of issues concerning special education resources in the school. This discussion will also include the special educational needs, SEN, of the pupil in question.

The need for a post-primary school in Donabate is being considered in this context. The draft plan is nearing completion and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly. Following this, a public consultation process will be conducted by the commission on school accommodation. The process will culminate in a final area development plan that will provide a blueprint for educational infrastructure in the area for the next decade including the need or otherwise to provide a post-primary school in Donabate.

The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Department circular 19-02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the appeals board on 15 June 2005. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operations of the independent appeals board.

The question of the legal responsibility for the safety of children while boarding or alighting a school bus or while waiting for a service can only be determined having regard to the particular circumstances of each case, including the age of the children in question.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1166	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between the Department of Education and Science and the education partners. In the current school year, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises a principal and ten mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 273 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has two learning support posts and three resource teaching posts.In accordance with the staffing schedule that issued recently to boards of management, the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will be a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 238 pupils at 30 September 2004. To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeal board is now in place. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in the Department of Education and Science's primary circular 19-02, which is also available on its website. The appeal board met on 14 June and will meet again in July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.The closing dates for appeals for the forthcoming July and October meetings are 24 June and 7 October 2005 respectively. Appeals must be submitted to the primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone on the standard application form, clearly stating the criteria under which they are being made. The application form is available from the primary payments section of my Department or on my Department's website. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.I recently announced the introduction of a general allocation model to provide for teaching supports for pupils with high incidence disabilities and those with learning support requirements. Two posts have been allocated to the school referred to in respect of this cohort of pupils. Individual allocations of resource teaching support for pupils with low incidence disabilities will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child. Such applications are processed by the local special educational needs organiser. My Department's records indicate that this school is eligible to retain one post in respect of pupils with low incidence special educational needs for the forthcoming school year. The net effect is that the school will be retaining three of its special education posts to cater for the needs of pupils with learning difficulties and special educational needs for the forthcoming school year. The levels are appropriate in the context of reducing enrolments and the current number of pupils with special educational needs requiring a service. I am satisfied that the resources available to the school are sufficient to provide for the ongoing needs of these pupils.

Accordingly, I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that there has been a delay in announcing budgetary decisions for capital projects. In November 2004, I ended the freeze on third level capital funding following the report of the review group on the prioritisation of all capital projects in the third level sector, the Kelly report, when I gave immediate approval for key projects in the sector. The projects selected were identified as being of a high national priority and include a number of new facilities to support the provision of additional health skills places and the expansion of teacher training places.I also announced the reintroduction of a devolved grant scheme for minor capital works in the institutes of technology sector. The Institute of Technology, Tallaght received funding under this scheme. These announcements are the first steps in the process of addressing the infrastructural deficit in the third level sector. There are many further higher education projects recommended for funding in the Kelly report, including the projects at the Tallaght institute. I am considering how best to advance a number of these projects in the context of the capital envelope of funding available to me.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1168	There are eight SNAs employed in this school at present, some of whom are catering for the needs of pupils enrolled in special classes attached to the school. The school has sanction for four full-time posts and five part-time posts from next September. My Department has recently issued a letter to schools which have surplus SNA staff that contained guidelines for schools in selecting staff that should be let go. The letter confirmed that the selection criteria for determining whose contract should be terminated will be on a last in, first out, LIFO, basis subject to the contractual position pertaining in schools. This means that, unless the most junior SNA in the school has a written child specific contract that entitles her or him to remain in the school, her or his contract should be terminated on the basis that she or he is the most junior SNA in the school in terms of length of service.If, however, the school has operated on the basis of employing all SNAs on child specific contracts and offered such contracts to the SNAs, it is the SNA who is attached to the child who has been identified as no longer needing the services of an SNA that should be released. I can also confirm that my Department has recently agreed with the union representing SNAs the issue of compensation payments for SNAs who may be let go after a number of years' service or who may have their posts reduced from full-time to part-time. Details of this agreement will be made available to schools as soon as possible.An official of my Department has spoken with the principal of the school in question in respect of the issues raised by the Deputy. It appears that the eight SNAs currently employed in the school all had child specific contracts and all of the children in respect of whom those contracts applied will have left the school by the end of this school year. In the circumstances and as it is considered that all of its SNAs were out of contract, the school was proposing to interview for the posts that it has sanction for in September.It is the case that as some of the SNAs who had child specific contracts have been re-assigned to other children without any change being made to their contract, the school may have been operating a de facto seniority system rather than a child specific contract system. In the circumstances my Department has advised the school to raise the matter with the relevant school management body and to seek advice from that body as to how it should proceed. My Department has also advised the school that it may if it wishes combine the part-time posts to form full-time posts subject to it being satisfied that the needs of the children would be satisfactorily catered for under such an arrangement. I would add that if it is the case that current SNA staff are made redundant or have their posts reduced from full-time posts to part-time posts, the compensation scheme recently agreed with the union representing SNAs will apply.

With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, will process resource applications for children with special educational needs. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.The NCSE has confirmed to my Department that an application for additional resources for the pupils referred to by the Deputy has been received and is currently being processed. My Department's school planning section is also processing an application received from the management authority concerned for the provision of additional accommodation to accommodate the pupils in question.

As part of the preparation of a three year scheme under section 11 of the Official Languages Act 2003, staff in my Department were surveyed and asked to identify their fluency in the Irish language. An analysis of the survey showed that 13 officers in PO, AP and HEO posts considered themselves to have fluent Irish and to be able to deliver a comprehensive service through Irish. In addition to these 13 officers, there would be others who would have a degree of fluency in the Irish language but who do not consider themselves able to deliver a comprehensive service through Irish. Under section 13 of the Act, public bodies have a duty to ensure that an adequate number of its staff are competent in the Irish language. The Department's scheme under section 11 of the Act will identify how this will be addressed.

My officials have been advised by the NCSE that the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, has examined the application for the pupil in question. I can confirm that the pupil has been sanctioned five hours' resource teaching support and access to a full-time special needs assistant. The school authorities have been notified accordingly.

Where a suitably qualified teacher is not available, they may engage an unqualified person while continuing to actively seek a qualified replacement. Prior to December 2001, all part-time and substitute teachers in post-primary schools were paid a standard hourly rate of pay. With the introduction of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, the Department introduced separate rates of payment for qualified and unqualified substitute and part-time teachers. Interim arrears backdated to December 2001 were paid by the schools to qualified substitute and part-time teachers, for example, teachers who hold a degree with teaching subjects and a higher diploma in education.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1173	The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, and the Giving Children an Even Break programme, GCEB. Under the scheme, the school benefits from additional capitation grants of €38.09per capita, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects. Designated disadvantaged schools are included in the home school community liaison scheme and the school has access to the services of a shared home school community liaison co-ordinator.Under the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, the school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for pupils who are considered to be at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The level of funding provided under this scheme is commensurate with the number of "at risk" pupils in the school. The school is not considered eligible for additional teaching staff under this scheme based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils within its enrolment.As the Deputy will be aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.The original allocation to the school was one post and 15 part-time hours. However, on consideration of the contents of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy, the general allocation has been increased to two teaching posts. This decision has been communicated to the school authorities. In addition, the school in question may be able to form an additional teaching post based on low incidence hours in the school. My officials are liaising with the school principal regarding the matter. I can confirm that the school's resource teaching allocation under the new scheme is based on its status as a mixed school, for instance, the first post is allocated at 145:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. This school is not eligible for such additional staffing and so does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation.

The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining these procedures issued to all primary schools. The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year was considered by the appeals board on 14 June 2005 and the board of management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the appeals board on 16 June 2005. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operations of the independent appeals board. Accordingly, I am not in a position to meet with a delegation on this matter.

These arrangements were implemented during the 2003-04 school year. For the 2004-05 school year, CABAS Dublin was allocated a budget of €1,006,321.61 to cater for 24 children. The funding allocation for the 2005-06 school year will represent an increase on this figure to take into account the additional resources required to fund the expansion of CABAS to cater for 30 children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	The recent report of the Irish language commissioner highlighted the fact that despite appreciable time devoted to Irish in the school system, many students emerge from primary and post-primary education without achieving a reasonable command of the language. Particular concerns were raised about students' command of the spoken language. The report by An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta raised similar concerns about the level of Irish being used in Gaeltacht schools.While I accept that the standard of oral Irish in particular of many of our young people is not as it should be, it is important to note that significant efforts have been made by my Department in recent years to improve standards in the teaching and learning of Irish in our schools. The revised Irish language programme at primary level places a strong emphasis on oral Irish. This programme, implemented in all schools since September 2003 and supported by extensive in-service training by the primary curriculum support programme, should bring significant improvement to the standard of spoken Irish over time. This development at primary level complemented similar curricular changes at second level where syllabus reform is ongoing.Significant improvements are being made in regard to the provision of materials and resources for the teaching of Irish. An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta has been established to advance this area and to provide support services for schools. Funding has been provided to An Chomhairle to support this task and I know that this is an area that will need further work. Marino Institute of Education now provides Irish courses at different levels for teachers and an enhanced range of supports for those studying for the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cailíochta sa Ghaeilge has been put in place.At the request of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is carrying out a review of languages in the post-primary curriculum, which will include Irish. My Department has invited the Council of Europe to carry out an analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary levels. The position of Irish will be a particular consideration during this analysis. A team of international experts will complement the NCCA's review. The Council of Europe's report will be due in 2006.The inspectorate of my Department, on foot of a major review of Irish language policies carried out in the Department last year, has recently prepared an internal report for policy discussion regarding areas where further improvements could be made. The Coimisinéir Teanga, along with other interest groups, contributed to that process. The inspectorate is currently preparing a composite report on the teaching and learning of Irish in the junior cycle in post-primary schools. This report will be based on evaluations that were carried out in 75, just over 10%, of post-primary schools during 2004-05. It will provide evidence-based findings on strengths and weaknesses and will contain recommendations for improvement to support schools, teachers and the system in general. I have also recently met with An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta to discuss further improvements that could be made to support schools in improving the teaching and learning of Irish and to promote high quality education through the medium of Irish.It is important to note that the issue of promoting the Irish language is not one that can be advanced by schools alone. Societal attitudes to the Irish language certainly impact on students' desire to learn it. This Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to promoting our national language. It is hoped that the continuing initiatives in education along with the increased emphasis on the use of Irish in the Official Languages Act 2003 will create in time a positive climate whereby students will realise the value of learning our native language. As a consequence, language competence will prosper.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	My Department is currently engaged in discussions with Educate Together in respect of annual funding. The provision of some additional funding in 2005, to meet the immediate issues of concern to Educate Together is under discussion with their longer term needs. The current level of funding my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrunachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.Regarding support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage. My Department has made a number of changes in recent years that have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	There is evidence to confirm that the proportion of students with a disability is growing in third level. The preliminary results of a recent survey of participation in third level conducted by the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, indicate that participation by students with a disability in third level education has improved over the past five years and in 2003-04 represented 2.4% or 2,732 of all undergraduate students in higher education institutions compared to a participation rate of 0.6% ten years before in 1994.A substantial proportion of this rise in participation is accounted for by increased participation or identification of students with specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia, who form over 52% of students with a disability. Other categories and percentages include 16% who have a mobility disability, 5% who are blind or visually impaired, 7% who are deaf or hard of hearing, 8% who have mental health difficulties and 12% who have other disabilities. The fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by the national office, provides support for students who have serious sensory, physical or learning disabilities. The aim of the fund is to assist students with disabilities to access and participate fully in higher and further education by providing support for the provision of equipment and services.The types of supports and assistance for which funding can be sought fall into three broad categories, namely, assisting technology equipment and software, such as AT items that are directly linked to the students disability, learning support, including personal assistance, and transport, for example, for students with a physical disability who cannot avail of public transport. Under the fund for students with disabilities for the 2004-05 academic year, the total number of individual students provided with funding was 1,459 with 332 group applications also benefiting. The total amount allocated under this fund for 2004-05 was €6.7 million.In addition to the above, the enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, which has been operational since 1 January 2005, provide a legislative and structural framework for the support of all children with disabilities. The Act provides a comprehensive legislative framework to govern the delivery of these services while the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will improve and speed up the delivery of services to pupils with special needs, their parents and schools.I would point out to the Deputy that the Government has provided an unprecedented level of resources to enable children with disabilities to achieve their full potential. As of next September, there will be over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. Furthermore, the number of special needs assistants has increased from approximately 300 in 1998 to over 6,300 today. I can assure the Deputy that the Government is deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs.

It may be that a number of such pre-October 1964 quarries are taking the opportunity to regularise their position under the planning code in the context of the new registration process mandated by section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was commenced from 28 April 2004, introduced a once-off system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission has been granted in the last five years. Under the registration system, quarry operators must supply full details of their operations to the planning authority, including information on the area of the quarry, the material being extracted, the hours of operation and the traffic, noise and dust generated by the quarry. This information was required to be supplied within a year, for example, by 27 April 2005.Regarding quarries that have registered, a planning authority may restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry that has received planning permission over five years ago. A planning authority may also impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or, if such a quarry would be likely to have significant effects on the environment and has an extracted area that is greater than five hectares, it must require an application for planning permission and the submission of an environmental impact statement.Guidelines on quarries and ancillary activities to assist with the implementation of section 261 were issued to planning authorities at the time the section was commenced. Local authorities have also been reminded by my Department on a number of occasions, most recently in the memorandum on grants for non-national roads of February 2001, that there should be full compliance with the planning laws in relation to any proposed use of land as temporary quarries during the duration of any works.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1193	Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, as amended by the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, primary responsibility for monitoring air quality and the nature, extent and effects of emissions rests with local authorities. Statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the Act is vested in local authorities and they are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit air pollution. They may direct a person on whom notice is served to take such measures as may be specified to prevent or limit air pollution. Pollutant in this context includes a substance that gives rise to odour.In the case of activities licensable by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, as amended by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, responsibility for the proper management of odours by the activities concerned is a matter for the agency. The rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, requires that participating farmers do not spread slurry within 50 metres of any school grounds, public building or amenity area. A buffer strip of up to 50 metres is recommended where land spreading takes place adjacent to private dwellings. In addition, slurry must only be applied with low trajectory spreaders, band spreaders or injection methods.A number of local authorities have also issued good practice guidelines to farmers for slurry and fertiliser spreading in order to minimise any environmental impact. Finally, Ireland's nitrates action programme, which will come into effect on 1 January 2006, will provide for a range of measures to strengthen the application of good agricultural practice in all areas. These measures, in tandem with the measures already in place, will considerably reduce the problems of odour from slurry.

The third and fourth are Directive 2002/88/EC on measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery and Directive 2004/26/EC amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to emissions from internal combustion engines in non-mobile road machinery. Draft regulations transposing both directives are nearing completion with a view to transposition during this summer.Directive 2002/95/EC and 2002/96/EC with its amending Directive 2003/108/EC are two related directives and deal respectively with restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and arrangements for dealing with waste electrical and electronic equipment. These directives will be fully transposed before 13 August 2005 when the take-back of electrical and electronic waste will become operable. Legislative proposals for the transposition of Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, repealing Directive 90/313/EEC, are in drafting. It is intended that this directive will be transposed by the end of the year.I am keenly aware of the importance of timely transposition of EU environmental legislation, some 200 items of which, including more than 140 directives, have by now been transposed in this country. More recently, external legal and drafting expertise have been utilised in order to expedite this.

The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12 month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km by 10 km grid square throughout the country, involving a total of over 11,000 houses.Of the 270 homes measured for radon in County Sligo during the survey, 54 or 20% exceeded the national reference level of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre, Bq/m3, and the average concentration level was 145 Bq/m3. The highest level measured in the county was 969Bq/m3. Over the years, the Government, largely through the RPII, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. While the provision of Exchequer grant assistance for remediation works is not envisaged, efforts will continue to be directed at improving information to householders so as to enable them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically. Radon detection kits are widely available from general hardware stores at a cost of approximately €40.Upgraded building regulations introduced in June 1997 require all new houses that commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C, TGD-C, on Part C of the Building Regulations — Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture, incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon, to urge householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the national reference level to undertake the appropriate remediation works.
