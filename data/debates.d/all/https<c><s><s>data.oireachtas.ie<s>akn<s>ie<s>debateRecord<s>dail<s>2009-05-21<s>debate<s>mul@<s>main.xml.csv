#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20521	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	On that motion, Fine Gael cannot agree to the proposal until we receive clarity on the arrangements for a debate on the Ryan report published today.  This harrowing report demands the urgent attention of the Oireachtas.  Any words of apology from us on behalf of the State will ring hollow in the ears of people who were at the mercy of and mistreated by the courts, who were dependent on the Department of Education to provide supervision and protection for them and were let down and, who, when they complained of abuse were not listened to, which is an appalling litany.The State, charged with supervision, simply turned its eye the other way.  It was too appalling to consider that the complaints made were true and needed to be acted upon.  Instead, it hid behind the relationships established with institutions, which is unforgivable.  Many lives have been broken.  To witness people breaking down years after these incidents, still broken and hurt by their experience, shakes us all to the core.  We need to not only understand how a system could be operated in this way but how, when we entrusted people to care they were managed in a controlling and abusive system that was completely foreign to the notion of care that should be provided to children.  We need to understand how and why that happened and whether the remnants that caused that to happen remain extant.  Also, we need to understand why it was that when abusers became known, they were simply moved on to other institutions with evidence of the abuse covered up.  What happened is frightening.We, who were privileged to have had protected childhoods, can only imagine what it would have been like to live in terror, which is what the regime was.  Does the Tánaiste agree the failures of the State have been unforgivable?  Does she accept the State is still failing children in that recommendation 21 of the commission states that the 1999 guidelines need to be consistently applied?  Long since apologies were made publicly, the Government is still presiding over a system full of failures.We need a proper and substantive debate with a motion so that the House can by resolution decide what it will do now.  We need to allocate at least two days of Government time to explore the matter thoroughly and make the decisions that need to be made for the future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I join Deputy Bruton in making the same request before agreeing to the Order of Business this morning.  The report, which has now been made available, is shocking in what it tells us about a very shameful period in Irish history.  The report outlines the stories of more than 1,000 victims and how they were sexually abused in many cases, how the sexual abusers were protected and moved from one institution to another by people who knew what they were doing.  It outlines the degree of physical abuse that was inflicted on those children, who were flogged, were not properly clothed, were not properly fed, and were emotionally and physically brutalised.  It outlines the degree of bullying that took place.  In many cases children were abducted from their families and put into these institutions in a way to provide what can only be described as a kind of headage payment for institutions by people who knew that those children were being abused and that the only reason they were in those institutions was that they were from poor families.It was shameful in the way in which it was covered up and the way in which people in the then Department of Education knew about it, did not do anything about it, colluded in it and destroyed lives.  The least that those people deserve is to have the stories they told to the commission and the conclusions it drew from them discussed here in a way that will ensure that this shameful period in Irish history will be put behind us and lessons learnt from it.I am somewhat surprised at how the Government has responded to the report.  This morning I was surprised that the Government had to be shamed into sending a representative onto the "Morning Ireland" programme to discuss it.  When will the House have the debate on this report that we need to have?  The Government should now state that it will reverse the cut of €2 million that it imposed on the redress board.  I cannot imagine what the Government was thinking in applying that cut a few weeks before this eminent report was due to be published.We also need a mechanism to reopen the indemnity deal that was negotiated and agreed between the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the religious orders, which was concluded on the day before a new Government was formed in 2002.  It was concluded in circumstances in which no memorandum was brought to Government about the issue.  We are told that the then Attorney General was not directly involved in the matter.  All of this resulted in capping the contribution of the religious orders at €127 million, but the amount the taxpayer has had to pick up is almost ten times that and is now estimated at €1.2 billion.  Yesterday's report concludes: "The deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education towards the Congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty of inspection and monitoring of the schools [and in respect of its duty to the children]."  The same deferential and submissive attitude was alive and well when Deputy Woods concluded that agreement in 2002.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach to schedule at an early opportunity a Dáil debate to address the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  The report published yesterday contains what can only be described as a sickening litany of abuse and exploitation.  It is an indictment of not only the religious orders, but also the State through successive Governments.  The Department of Education failed to have any oversight or inspection that truly acted in the interests and needs of these innocent and vulnerable young children.  At the Whips' meeting, the Whips sought to follow through on what the Taoiseach indicated was a sympathetic position towards the proposition for early address of this report, given that it was the Houses of the Oireachtas that commissioned the report in the first place.  That needs to be made patently clear.  This was commissioned by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is imperative that the report is addressed here at the earliest opportunity.  However, there was no commitment from the Whips' meeting to have early address of the detail of the report and all the scandalous situations it exposes.In tandem with other voices, I again ask that we be afforded an opportunity on the floor of Dáil Chamber to address the report and its recommendations in the coming week given that at the end of next week the Dáil is proposing to rise for the following week in advance of the impending local and European Parliament elections.  On our return in the week after those elections of 5 June, there will be a limited number of weeks before we arrive at the summer recess.  This report is of great importance and probably addresses the most profound issues ever inquired into by the institutions of the State carried out by Ms Justice Laffoy and by Mr. Justice Ryan in the period since her departure.  It is imperative that this request is accommodated and I join the other voices in demanding that be done.We must recognise that within the recommendations there is a need to couple recommendations from other recently published reports, including that into the events at Monageer, because child abuse is not confined to decades past and in institutions overseen by religious orders.  Child abuse continues today in this society and we have a bounden responsibility to face up to that fact and take the appropriate measures, including the recommendations from the Monageer report for an out of hours social work service.  It was the very first recommendation of that report and unfortunately has been rejected by the Minister.  No other approach will suffice to ensure the necessary supports are available at the critical times in the evenings and at weekends when instances can and all too sadly do present.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse describes one of the darkest chapters in our history.  On this occasion it is appropriate to reiterate the words of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 11 May 1999, when he said, "On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue".  The first recommendation of yesterday's report is to confirm, consolidate and enshrine the terms of this apology.This report poses issues for the State on how it discharged its responsibilities, as well as for religious orders and wider society.  We should carefully reflect on its contents.  I agree that a considered and informed debate should be held in this House and I would appreciate if Members could come to an agreement on its format and timing.  Our offer is the week after next in order to allow people to inform themselves.  The Government will be holding a special meeting to consider the report.  As I do not wish to have any disagreement on the floor of the House, we agree in principle to the debate and perhaps we could arrange its timing among ourselves.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20521	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I ask the Tánaiste about the Government's programme of legislation for the protection of children.  The programme for Government makes several commitments in this regard, including a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of children, legislation which would make it possible for those who take sexual advantage of children to claim a defence of mistake regarding the age of their victims and on the carefully regulated exchange of information about child abusers.  Thus far we have seen none of these commitments.  The Tánaiste adverted to the legislation on exchange of information as being in the spring schedule but it does not even appear to have been drafted.  I would like her to indicate whether she has a clear schedule of legislation in respect of the defence of honest mistake, which deals with the striking down by the courts of the law on statutory rape, the new amendment on children's rights and the exchange of information.  Can we be given firm dates regarding their introduction to the House for debate?

Can the Tánaiste indicate when the civil union Bill will come before the House?  It appears to have been lost somewhere along the line.In regard to intercountry adoption, the Adoption Bill 2009 is being debated in the Seanad.  Various ethical and legal issues appear to have arisen in regard to intercountry adoption.  Will the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children outline these issues for the sake of people who are in emotional turmoil as they wait to adopt children and find the current situation untenable?  They are totally confused because are not getting the clarity of information they need.  If there is a specific problem, can it be addressed through legislation?  Will the Minister of State do the people the service of telling them what is the problem?

When the Government gave the undertaking relating to banking and financial services last September, the understanding was that as a result of the confidence accruing therefrom, latitude would be given to the business sector.  However, the position now is that the sector is being strangled slowly.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises the funding provided to Muscular Dystrophy Ireland (MDI) each year by the Health Service Executive to provide services to its members (€1.2 million in 2008);recognises that the Health Research Board (HRB) is the statutory agency with responsibility for funding health research in Ireland with a view to improving health and health outcomes;notes the funding provided to the HRB to allow it to jointly fund research projects with the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCG) including MDI;recognises the fact that research charities, including MDI, especially those investigating rare disorders, wish to fund projects that are led predominantly and perhaps even fully outside of Ireland and the fact that the HRB has developed the guidelines for this scheme with international efforts in mind;acknowledges the HRB work with the MRCG to achieve two objectives:to increase the amount of funding available to support research projects relevant to charities and specifically for rare diseases; andto develop a research management capacity among the research charities so that they are involved in managing calls for applications, peer reviewing applications and managing research contracts in line with international best practice;accepts that the HRB has, to date, cofunded two projects with MDI including a project on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and the HRB recently met with Duchenne Ireland in relation to the current call for applications;acknowledges this Government's commitment to people with a disability through the National Disability Strategy which was motivated by the needs of people such as those with muscular dystrophy; andwelcomes the additional funding which has been invested in support services for people with disabilities, including those with muscular dystrophy, which was provided to enhance the level and range of services available to adults and children with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and those with autism and for the recruitment of additional professional support staff.I would like to deal with the involvement of the Health Research Board, HRB and current and future research funding and to give clarity regarding the medical research charities group.  I do not want to give a cold response, as I am well aware of the huge concerns, fears and worries of parents, families and friends of children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  I hope to bring clarity and to confirm that the Government continues to believe in the need for further funding and research and to make it clear that we are always open to meet representatives of advocacy groups, as we have done in the past.I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the issues raised in the motion before the House.  I assure Deputies that the Government is aware of the situation of families with children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  While there are no guarantees with trialling new approaches to muscular dystrophy, I understand the hopes of families for a medical advancement in this field.  I hope later to bring clarity to the fact that funding is recognised for trials abroad.The HRB is the statutory agency with responsibility for funding health research in Ireland with a view to improving health and health outcomes.  Research funding is causing concern but it is allocated to projects, people, infrastructure and networks across the entire spectrum of health research from biomedical to clinical, including health services and health systems research.  I have been advised that, in line with international best practice, all HRB funding is awarded based on the principles of open competition and international peer review.Each proposal is assessed against specific explicit criteria.  In order to achieve this, the HRB issues calls for applications at various times of the year in certain areas.  The funding and the associated contract are normally awarded to a research institution in Ireland for a team of researchers to conduct the project.Since 2006, the Department of Health and Children has provided funding of €3 million to the HRB to allow it to fund research projects jointly with the medical research charities group, MRCG.  This was in recognition of the fact that some research charities, especially those investigating rare disorders, wish to fund projects that are led predominantly and perhaps even fully outside of Ireland.  The HRB developed the guidelines for this scheme with international efforts in mind.  Member charities can submit research projects to the HRB for joint funding where the research project is endorsed as a priority by the member charity and where there are justifiable reasons for the work being led outside this country.  In this jointly funded scheme, the HRB awards its funding to the member charity and the charity manages the research contract with the research team.The HRB has worked closely with the medical research charities group to achieve two things: first, to increase the amount of funding available to support research projects; and, second, to develop a research management capacity among the research charities.The HRB and board of the MRCG announce a call for applications and then invite charities to solicit research proposals.  The charities conduct an initial peer review and afterwards proposals are sent forward to the HRB for joint funding.  An expert panel is then convened, composed predominantly of international experts.  The expert panel makes recommendations and, if approved by the board of the HRB, co-funding is issued to the nominating charity.To date, three calls have been issued jointly between the HRB and the medical research charities group.  A total of 25 members of the latter group and 44 individual projects have secured joint funding under this scheme so far.  The HRB has co-funded two projects with Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.  One of the projects is based at NUI Maynooth and the other is a project in Imperial College, London.In 2008, another call for proposals was issued by the HRB and the MRCG.  I understand that charities are currently considering which applications and how many to forward for consideration.  They have until mid-June to do this.  The HRB and MRCG will convene an expert panel to review these projects towards the end of June and the recommendations from that panel will be put for approval to the board of the HRB shortly thereafter.  This new round of the scheme will provide funding for clearly defined research projects for up to 36 months.The HRB has been supportive of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.  Earlier this year, officials from the HRB met with Mr. Joe Mooney, the CEO of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, to talk about this current call for applications.  I understand Mr. Mooney was assured that there would be no maximum amount of HRB co-funding that could be allocated internationally.  The assessment criteria that will be used by the expert panel are as follows: excellent and high quality science; innovation; relevance and impact of the research on the disease; and expertise and research environment.I understand that both parties had a good discussion about developing and progressing a research strategy for the charity, with short and longer-term goals.  This included a discussion of additional funding schemes that the charity might think of targeting in future.The HRB has informed my Department of the up-to-date position on the project regarding the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The project was led by Professor Dominic Wells of Imperial College, London.  The total cost of the project was €100,000 and the co-funding from HRB was €50,000.  The research has been completed and a report has been requested by the HRB.As the Deputies will be aware, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a fatal muscle wasting disease of boys.  It is first noticed at three to five years.  The boys are in wheelchairs by ten and, unfortunately, without expert medical attention they will die in their late teens.  Recent developments in medical care have improved the quantity and quality of life with young men living into their mid-20s.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in the gene for a critical protein which is vital to muscle cells.  Without this protein the muscle is easily damaged and this results in muscle wasting.  A small genetic drug called a molecular patch has been developed that can convert some Duchenne muscular dystrophy genetic defects into a milder type of muscular dystrophy and this should prevent much of the muscle wasting.  In order to use this molecular patch it must first be proved to be safe.  This is checked by testing in animals to show the molecular patch is not damaging to breathing, the heart, the brain or the body generally.  The project at Imperial College London aims to perform these necessary tests so that, if it is safe, the molecular patch can be considered for use to treat boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The research at NUI Maynooth will give greater insight into the condition of muscular dystrophy.  Hopefully, one day, it could result in a new treatment that would make an enormous difference to the quality of life of those with muscular dystrophy.I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland.  I have had the pleasure of meeting the CEO and other representatives from the organisation and we have discussed a number of issues affecting their members.  The key aim of MDI is to provide support and information to people with muscular dystrophy and their families.  The organisation provides support services, such as family support, respite, youth activities and transport.  It also organises summer camps for members.  MDI also liaises with other service providers, when required, to access the best services for members.Muscular Dystrophy Ireland is also an active member of other groups, including the European Alliance of Neuromuscular Disorders Associations and the European Rare Disorders Organisation.  Similar to the Government's national disability strategy, MDI supports and promotes independent living for people with a disability.  MDI supports advocating services to enable people with neuromuscular conditions to participate fully in society and live a life of their own choosing.  As this debate shows, MDI also supports and funds research into neuromuscular conditions.As regards the issues of funding and services raised in the motion, the Government remains committed to the national disability strategy and doing all that we possibly can to give persons with disabilities the services and supports they need and deserve.  The needs of people with a disability, such as muscular dystrophy, was the motivation for the development of the national disability strategy.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	142	In the short time afforded to me, it will not be possible to touch on all the issues that arise concerning muscular dystrophy and, in particular, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Suffice it to say, as the Minister of State has pointed out, that these boys have a very short life span.  It is a matter of great trauma for their families and all those who are involved with them.  Ten boys are born every year with this condition.  It is very difficult once the boys are wheelchair bound for them to travel.  It is particularly onerous for them to have to travel abroad for research purposes.  We need an Irish arm of these trials so the Government should make the money available to do so.  We must get around whatever issues there are concerning the difficulties with funding trials that do not necessarily originate here.The most important message that needs to emanate from this debate is that people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have multiple needs.  From their point of view, the earlier intervention takes place the better.  It is really scandalous that we have so few neurologists in this country, generally, and that the two neurological service units available for people with muscular dystrophy are both in Dublin, at Beaumont and Temple Street.  Therefore, everybody concerned must travel to Dublin from Donegal, Cork and elsewhere to avail of these services.We do not have enough genetic testing facilities or sufficient respiratory cardiac care monitoring for the children, which could make a huge difference to their quality of life.  If they do not have a medical card, they must pay the first €90 per month towards the cost of breathing machines which aid ventilation.  That represents further hardship for them amounting to an annual sum of €1,080.Some 97 members of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland receive no physiotherapy nationwide and there are 40 who cannot access an occupational therapist.  That number has increased from 20 in 2008.  The last paragraph of the Minister of State's speech rings a little hollow when one considers the facts of the matter.  It states:This Government will continue to invest in and lead in the reform of a health service that works towards improving access to a high quality health and personal social service.  We will support the development and delivery of quality services right across the country.What Muscular Dystrophy Ireland would like to see is more funding for the multidisciplinary team at Beaumont Hospital to support the neurologist there; the paediatric neurology team to be made permanent and boosted; more consultant geneticists; funding for the respiratory team at the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street and funding for respiratory and cardiac services, as I mentioned.  Will the Minister of State support the recommendation of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland that the Government introduce a cost of disability payment of €40 per week for people with disabilities in receipt of means tested social welfare payments?It is recognised nationally and internationally that people with disabilities incur many extra but ordinary costs such as food, heating and clothing as a result of their disability.  This matter was identified by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the National Economic and Social Forum and they both recommended the payment.  This is something real and tangible that could arise from this debate.Research on exon skipping needs to be supported to ensure that it runs to its conclusion and, potentially, to the development of new therapy.  Above all, I implore the Minister of State to ensure we give hope to our citizens who suffer with this illness and their families that there could be light at the end of the tunnel and that we are prepared to invest in their future by investing in this research.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I reiterate what Deputy Reilly said on early intervention and multidisciplinary services at Beaumont Hospital for those suffering from muscular dystrophy.  It is important to put on the record what muscular dystrophy is because many people are unaware of this reasonably rare condition and the life expectancy of people who suffer with it.  Muscular dystrophy is the collective name for a range of neuromuscular conditions which are characterised by progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles.  It can affect adults and children; some forms arise at birth or in childhood and others may not manifest themselves until later in life.Each type of muscular dystrophy arises from a different genetic mutation or deletion which is inherited from one or both parents or is due to a spontaneous mutation.  This means that many families have more than one member with the condition.  There is no cure for it but there have been huge advances in increasing the quality of life for people with the condition and researchers are working hard to develop new treatments.  It is very important that the State, the Department and the HSE ensure the best quality of treatment and support and that the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other Departments support those who suffer from the condition and ensure their quality of life is as good as possible.The issues which affect those people with the condition are diverse and include access to medical services such as neurological assessment; genetic testing and counselling; respiratory and cardiac monitoring and treatment; community services including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, aids and appliances; accessible housing and transport; access to education, training and employment and research funding.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to ensure that these services are made available to all who suffer from this very serious and debilitating condition.

It causes the loss of muscle function and independence.  DMD has no cure and is 100% fatal at present.  However, this does not have to be the case.  Research is under way to find a therapy that will help to delay the progression of the disease and provide the potential to find a cure.  Research is striving to improve the treatment, quality of life and long-term outlook for all individuals affected by muscular dystrophy, specifically DMD.Time is not on the side of these boys.  The families are looking for support from the Government and through Duchenne Ireland they have created a fund of €300,000 to promote this research.  The families have put their money upfront and what they now seek from the Government is hope.  The severity of this disease means the boys and their families desperately seek even the smallest positive research result but the fact is that research is becoming more positive.  However, the research is the only hope these boys have for a future.To cure muscular dystrophy and DMD, the conditions have to be stopped or at least alleviated.  Research tries to focus on gene and drug therapy — gene therapy examines the repairing of the damaged gene or replacing it by other means and drug therapy examines blocking or slowing down the muscle degeneration without influencing the damaged gene itself.  Both approaches are vital and while important progress has been made during the past number of years, to date neither gene nor drug therapy has developed so far that it could provide a cure for the Duchenne boys.  Progress has been made with drug therapy, which can now slow down the degeneration of the muscles.  No one wants to raise false hopes but research is the only way forward and the very least that we can provide is hope and the potential for successful treatment and a future cure for this disease.It is an indication of the lack of support that 148 of the people with muscular dystrophy in this country are based in Dublin, with only eight in my county of Roscommon.  Many of them have moved to Dublin because they are not able to avail of basic services in their own homes and communities.  It is a damning indictment of the health system that people have to leave their families and homes and travel to Dublin to avail of a service.  However, this is not available to the Duchenne boys because many of them die before they reach their twenties.  It is important that we have better management of muscular dystrophy as this has been shown to increase the life expectancy of all those diagnosed with this debilitating disease.I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the policy decision taken on funding research outside the country.  We will never have the resources here to go it alone on research into some of these very rare diseases.  Surely we should be working with our colleagues in the UK and throughout Europe.  I commend the Fine Gael amendment to the House.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I am glad we had an opportunity to table the amendment and to make the points we wish to make.I welcome this debate because it is important we have an opportunity in the parliamentary Chamber to raise this important issue and tease out what are the obstacles for the families who have to cope with this devastating illness.  While we proposed an amendment to the Government's motion, it is welcome that certain progress has been made and I acknowledge that.  The purpose of this debate is to make progress and for this reason our amendment contains specific proposals and I want to use the time I have to address them.This is a very severe progressive muscle-wasting disease.  It is devastating news when it comes to the families concerned.  As has been stated, certain families have more than one boy affected and approximately one in 3,500 boys in the population is affected by this disease.  The only hope is that we can participate in international trials to make whatever progress can be made in co-operation with people in a variety of countries throughout the world.  That is why we made specific points in our amendment.The Minister said that funding is available through the Health Research Board in conjunction with the Medical Research Charities Group and that there is a system of tendering for this funding.  He mentioned a sum of €3 million.  That sum goes to the Health Research Board but a much smaller sum is available for tendering in the Medical Research Charities Group.  I understand that approximately 29 charities are involved in this process.  The actual amount of money available, therefore, for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is relatively small and is not the amount required to participate fully in the international trials, be it the exon skipping trial, the molecular patch research to which the Minister referred or other research.  The exon skipping trial has attracted the involvement of families in Ireland and it appears to be having considerable success.  It is the trial in which Irish families wish to be involved.  However, as the amount of money is so small it is not possible for Ireland to participate fully.  Duchenne Ireland has raised €300,000 through its efforts but it needs the Government to provide adequate funding for this international research.It is also necessary to have a clinical trial centre in Ireland.  If the funding is ring-fenced for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and if a clinical centre is established in Ireland — a large number of countries have already established these centres — this country can participate fully in the trials and the international effort in this area.  With such a rare disease we must co-operate internationally to make progress.  The Irish group is already in direct contact with international bodies that represent families with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The group is sending information on boys in Ireland to the UK charity and to the National Centre for Medical Genetics at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, so there is a data gathering process taking place to feed into this research.I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, listens to the comments from the Opposition.  While there is a certain amount of effort on the part of the Government and a certain amount of money is being provided, it is not enough for Ireland to participate fully in the international studies and for Irish boys to have the opportunity to take part in those studies.  We must go the extra distance in terms of both funding and establishing a centre in this country.The other point made by the Labour Party is that Ireland should adopt international standards of care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in conjunction with other countries and the National Centre for Medical Genetics.  The US Centre for Disease Control is drafting those standards in conjunction with other countries at present.  We must participate in this process so Ireland will be an equal participant in the international effort being made.These are the three elements that are required in addition to what is being done already in this country.  I hope this debate, with participation from all sides of the House, will enable us to make the required progress for the families concerned.  All parties have noted that the Joint Committee on Health and Children voted unanimously in 2008 in favour of supporting funding of research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy, so there is already all-party agreement that this should be done.The main points I intended to make relate specifically to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the actions that must be taken in that regard.  However, the motion also deals with muscular dystrophy in general.  Some points should be made about what is generally required in that area.  I attended the briefings held by Muscular Dystrophy Ireland for Members of the Oireachtas both this year and last year in Buswells Hotel.  A number of points were made by the organisation, most of which have been outlined by Deputy Reilly.  A few of these points should be emphasised.  One is the need for an adequate neurology service in Ireland, not just for muscular dystrophy but to deal with a variety of neurological conditions.  However, people with muscular dystrophy have a particular need for a proper national neurological service.  There is also a need for physiotherapy services and other therapies.  Many sufferers are confined to wheelchairs and have significant needs across the spectrum of health professionals which must be met.Muscular Dystrophy Ireland also pointed to the need for an adequate personal assistant service for those who can stay in their homes.  They can live a full live if there is an adequate personal assistant service.  I spoke to some of the people concerned and their families and they said there is a shortage of some of the supports they require which makes it difficult for them to live at home.  With any of these illnesses it is better if the person with the illness can live at home, but it also saves money for the taxpayer in terms of not having to keep people in much more expensive institutions.Families of sufferers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy also made the point that if they can participate in research and improve the life of the individual boy, it is also cost effective.  Recent statements from both the Government and Opposition parties have pointed to the importance of research and Ireland being a strong centre for research across the spectrum, which is a wider issue.  However, with regard to research into genetic disorders, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy, if we can move the process forward today, we will contribute to the broader policy of Ireland taking a leading role in research, on which all parties are agreed, and being fully integrated into international research across the board.  If we can take this step for the boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families, we can make a real difference to their lives.  I hope progress will be made following this debate.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I welcome this debate and the opportunity to highlight the condition of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD, and the needs of people with this condition and their families.  It is unfortunate that the Dáil cannot speak with one voice on this issue.  While the motion put down by the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, sets out some of the key facts, it is narrow in scope, self-congratulatory in tone and fails to identify outstanding needs of muscular dystrophy sufferers and the obligations on Government to meet those needs.  For that reason Sinn Féin Deputies support the amendments put down by the Labour Party and Fine Gael Members.There are two broad areas of need identified — enhanced Government support for DMD research and the development of services to people with muscular dystrophy in general.  I have previously raised in the House the shortage of neurologists in our health system and the acute need for enhanced support for neurology in the national centre, which is Beaumont Hospital.  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland points out that there are currently two muscular dystrophy clinics for people with the condition, a clinic for adults in Beaumont Hospital Dublin and one for children in the Central Remedial Clinic, Dublin.  This means people must travel from all over the country to Dublin to access services.  Adults come to Beaumont Hospital to meet the neurologist but there is no multidisciplinary team to co-ordinate all aspects of care, including respiratory, cardiac, dietary, occupational therapy and so forth.  Travelling to and from  Dublin causes additional physical, emotional and financial stress for the person with muscular dystrophy and their families.People affected by muscular dystrophy receive genetic testing and counselling from the National Centre for Medical Genetics, NCMG.  However, the NCMG is still not funded to provide a nationwide genetic testing service.  The NCMG has four consultants for the State's population of more than 4.2 million whereas in Belfast, there are six consultants for the Six Counties' population of 1.7 million.  Monitoring the breathing and heart function of people with muscular dystrophy is essential in maintaining quality and, in some cases, length of life.  However, there is no co-ordinated approach to care and those requiring access to the service usually have to travel to Dublin.People with muscular dystrophy who have breathing difficulties must hire ventilators to assist them.  Those without a medical card are obliged to pay the first €100 per month of the cost of this facility under the drugs payment scheme in order to stay alive.  This equates to an annual cost of €1,200 which, in many cases, must be paid from a relatively low net income.  Breathing machines improve not only the quality of life of muscular dystrophy patients, but also their life expectancy.  The cost of using such a device should not be a prohibitive burden.  Therefore, medical cards should be available to all persons with muscular dystrophy.These people are undoubtedly suffering as a consequence of Government health cuts.  There are currently 97 members of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland who are receiving no physiotherapy.  Forty cannot access an occupational therapist, an increase from 20 last year.  There is also a major problem in terms of access to community services including physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  In addition, waiting times for essential aids and appliances are too long, up to a year in some case.  There are 61 Muscular Dystrophy Ireland members waiting for the equipment they require, an increase from 42 in 2008.Respite is essential for people with muscular dystrophy and for their carers.  People with muscular dystrophy generally require in-home as opposed to residential respite care.  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland provides short-term respite but its limited funding means it cannot provide support to all who need it.  Additional funding is necessary for the provision of longer-term respite care through other agencies.  People with muscular dystrophy have a great need for personal assistance in order to access education and employment and to engage in day-to-day living, but many cannot access such services.  Currently, 50 members of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland who require a personal assistant have no hours.  A further 53 members have been allocated a personal assistant but clearly require more hours, an increase from 50 in 2008.  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland indicates that 88 of its members will require a personal assistant in the next five years.  Children and young people with muscular dystrophy attending school will require a special needs assistant, SNA, as their condition progresses.  There are currently 67 children with muscular dystrophy using SNAs in school, an increase from 50 in 2008.  Over the next five years, 39 more children will require the service.Muscular Dystrophy Ireland identifies various provisions which are urgently required.  Funding must be provided to set up a multidisciplinary team for the adults' muscle clinic in Beaumont Hospital to support the consultant neurologist there.  The consultant paediatric neurologist needs permanent and adequate funding in order to recruit a research clinician to assist with medical audits and management of the clinics, as well as support with research.  We are now entering a time when clinical trials are developing.  This position has been advertised but is not fully funded.  More consultant geneticists are required.  There are currently fewer in this State than in the Six Counties.  This leads to longer waiting lists to access genetic testing and counselling services.Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has also indicated that the respiratory team at the Children's University Hospital,Temple Street, requires funding to ensure all children with muscular dystrophy are monitored and treated for respiratory problems as soon as it is required.  Funding for respiratory and cardiac services is essential as these are making a great difference to the quality of life of persons with muscular dystrophy.  The cost of breathing machines should be covered for those who require them.  More physiotherapists and occupational therapists must be recruited to ensure people with muscular dystrophy can access them as they need them on an ongoing basis.The personal assistant service is vastly underfunded.  Some 91,000 personal assistant hours per year are required immediately for people with muscular dystrophy who are currently receiving no service.  Moreover, provision must be made for the 160,160 hours per year that will be required in the next five years.  The long-standing demand for the introduction of a cost of disability payment — for which I and others in this House have argued repeatedly, particularly in our pre-budget submissions over the last decade — is of particular relevance to people with muscular dystrophy given the many additional costs they face.  It is our collective responsibility as elected representatives to ensure this funding is allocated in order to provide the essential back-up and support that is so urgently required.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue.  Last month, I met with representatives of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland who held an information session in Buswells Hotel.  Although I had some awareness of the issues as a member of my family suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, I was shocked and saddened by what I learned.  We must ensure there is greater awareness of this debilitating illness.Muscular dystrophy is the collective name for a range of neuromuscular conditions which sees those affected suffer from progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles.  It can affect both adults and children, with some forms of the condition arising  at birth or in childhood and others not manifesting themselves until later in life.  Muscular dystrophy arises from a genetic mutation and people can carry the defective gene without realising it.  This gene is inherited from one or both parents in most instances, which means there may be more than one member with the condition in a particular family.There is no cure for muscular dystrophy.  However, I am informed by Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, which does great work in this area, that there have been major advances in increasing the quality of life for people with the condition.  Furthermore, scientists throughout the world are working hard to develop new treatments.  Treatments that can improve the quality of life for sufferers include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and surgical intervention.  Along with ensuring greater awareness and understanding of the condition, we must support those suffering from it as best we can.There has been some progress in this area.  Therapy services for adults with muscular dystrophy are generally delivered through primary care teams or community therapy services.  The numbers of therapy staff employed in primary and continuing community care settings has increased significantly.  In December 2007, there were 638 physiotherapy staff and 789 occupational therapy staff.  By the end of 2008, those staff numbers had increased to 670 and 796, respectively.Therapy services for children with muscular dystrophy can be delivered through specialist disability providers or through primary and community care services.  The Government is committed to delivering primary care in a local setting and it is my hope that those with muscular dystrophy will benefit from this investment.  Furthermore, resources have been allocated to increase the level of multidisciplinary supports available to children with disabilities in the context of the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually affects children between the ages of two and six and has a major impact on their life expectancy.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy eventually affects all voluntary muscles as well as the heart and breathing muscles.  Survival is rare beyond the early 30s.  It is a worst nightmare for any parent to learn that his or her child is suffering from a debilitating and incurable illness.  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has indicated that 88 of its members are suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  In the past ten years, 59 boys and young men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have died as a result of their condition.  It is important that Deputies have been given an opportunity to discuss what is a nightmare scenario for many parents.  For this reason, I commend Deputies McHugh and Doyle on tabling the motion.According to its mission statement, the objectives of Duchenne Ireland are to raise awareness of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at local, national and government level and to raise funds to go directly to researchers and clinicians who offer the best chance of developing improved therapies that will benefit this generation of sufferers.  The organisation also works towards achieving an infrastructure which is on a par with best international practice and aims to fund translational research for Duchenne muscular dystrophy which will move towards the clinic within a defined timeline.  It encourages applicants to have in place a clear path to the clinic if work is successful, in other words, to have a plan for success.Duchenne Ireland has set the following immediate goals: to raise funds aimed at translational research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy and associated grant calls to ensure the money is best used in a timely manner; to lobby the Government to play its part in driving research forward for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; to inform parents about the therapies and standards of care available for those with the condition; to raise awareness of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at local, national and Government level; and to increase Ireland's ability to play a key part in Duchenne research through industry, patient and Government co-operation.Muscular Dystrophy Ireland also does terrific work in this area, providing information and support to people with neuromuscular conditions and their families through a range of support services.  It offers a lifeline for sufferers and their families and helps empower sufferers and supports them to lead independent lives.  Last year, the organisation received €3 million in Government funding.  Funding should be made available to both Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and Duchenne Ireland to ensure young people with these conditions have a chance in life.  Given the significant benefits research funding could deliver, I implore the Minister to ensure funds are made available for clinical trials in the area of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  While I am aware that resources are scarce, those suffering from this disease should be supported in all possible ways.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I propose to share time with Deputies O'Donnell and Perry.Duchenne muscular dystrophy is registered as a rare disease and, as such, does not affect many individuals and families.  Nonetheless, those who are affected by this condition find that it consumes their lives.  When couples marry and have children, they expect their children will survive them but parents of children diagnosed with this condition at the age of four or five years must face the prospect that they will survive their children.I note from the tone of contributions by Government Deputies, particularly Deputy Scanlon, and I accept that they feel as passionately about this issue as Deputies on this side.  The sole motivation of my party, in tabling an amendment, is to offer hope and do everything in our power to assist those suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families.  All we ask is that Members throw a lifeline to sufferers and their families.We have heard about clinical trials in this field.  The prognosis for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is that they will not, in the main, reach their 21st birthday.  I am reluctant to be so blunt but this is the fact faced by the parents of children with this condition.  Clinical drug trials offer the only hope of enabling these children and their parents to enjoy family life in the manner the rest of us do.  We must allow these children and families to embrace hope by supporting clinical drug trials.  Lists of treatments are available setting out progress being made in this area, including in this country.The amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party calls on the Government to "ensure there is a care and clinical trial site in Ireland that is registered with the Treat-NMD clinical trials co-ordination centre and also to ensure that the new DMD standards of care are fully implemented in this country."  This is all we ask.  By taking these steps, we will allow money to flow.  In January 2008, I wrote to the then Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, who I am pleased to note is present, calling for these steps to be taken.  He responded that this could be done only through the Health Research Board.  Dealing with the HRB, however, is similar to seeking a local improvement scheme grant from a council in the sense that one joins the back of the queue.  The board does not appear to engage in any form of prioritisation of need.  While no one argues against the provision of funding for other research trials taking place in many other areas, as with everything else, time is not on the side of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.The Fine Gael Party does not seek political kudos but asks Government Deputies to follow their hearts and to support the amendment.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I thank Deputies McHugh and Doyle for drafting this important motion.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a degenerative muscular disease which causes progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles.  It can affect adults and children.  Some forms of the condition arise at birth or in childhood, while others may not manifest until later in life.  The disease results in reduced life expectancy.A number of Irish families are directly affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  A boy in my constituency, whose father and grandmother are in the Visitors Gallery, has recently been diagnosed with the disease.  Having a child diagnosed with such a serious illness is one of the most difficult and sad experiences any family can endure.  Like any parent, I ask myself how and why this can happen to any child but specifically the child in question.  I also ask myself what can be done to fix the problem and whether the child can be cured by medical science.  Beyond this, there is faith and the hope of a miracle cure.Regrettably, there is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy at present.  The parents of children with the condition look to current research in the hope that an interim therapy will be found to help delay the progression of the disease, while science searches for an understanding of and cure for the condition.  I strongly urge the Minister to make the maximum possible financial provision for services to Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and their families.  Community services, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, aids and appliances, such as wheelchairs and orthopaedic footwear, accessible housing and transport, and access to education, training and employment are critical to the quality of life of patients and their families.  In addition, easy access to medical services, such as neurological assessment, respiratory and cardiac monitoring, and treatment are also critical.  These services form the basis for a worthwhile quality of life for patients at home and in the local community.  They are also an important support for the parents and family members of patients with the disease.Better management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been shown to increase average life expectancy.  While these developments greatly add to quality of life, they cannot prevent or stop the progression of the condition.  For this reason, there is a real need for ongoing research.  Promising research projects are in place in other countries.  It is important in this area of research, as in other areas, that we invest in more co-operative research with other countries.  Such co-operation will ensure Irish patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy will be an integral part of current clinical trials of new drugs and Irish medical personnel are at the leading edge of new treatments and therapies.I ask the Minister to ensure there are no obstacles to funding from Ireland being used in projects that are led predominantly or perhaps fully outside Ireland.  We need to be fully plugged in to the leading research projects investigating rare disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  As we cannot fund this research alone, let us set the standard in enthusiastic co-operation with other leading research teams.As a long-time advocate of better co-operation with the United States, I strongly suggest that we should have at least one co-operative research project with the leading researchers there.While the removal of obstacles to funds from Ireland being used in projects outside Ireland is important, the real challenge is to increase the funding into DMD research.  In this connection, I would ask the Minister to support this project.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	152	In Clare there are 21 children registered with muscular dystrophy.  In the few minutes available to me let me tell the story of my cousin and her four children.  Their two boys had muscular dystrophy and the two girls have it as well.The two boys are now dead, but let me tell of their lifestyle.  They died at the age of 20.  Between the ages of four and five they were diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.  They were diagnosed when they started walking on their toes because they could not put their heels on the ground.  They never learned to ride a tricycle like other children or have a normal life, and they fell very easily.I knew the two children well.  At the age of eight, they became wheelchair-bound.   The family had to provide electric wheelchairs because this gave them mobility and, most important, independence.  At the age of 14, both children had operations for curvature of the spine.  This operation lifts the spine off the lungs and gives the children more breathing capacity.  They were under constant care.Parents have a tough job with children with muscular dystrophy.  They act as carers, nurses and physiotherapists because physiotherapy must be provided on a daily basis.  They become dietitians because the children's diets must be watched carefully.  They also act as teachers.Both of these boys coped well at school and were treated very inclusively.  Both had got to university before they died.  As they got older, their mother told me, they learned more about their disorder from the Internet.  Of course, it gets harder because such children know they do not have long to live.  At night time they need constant monitoring because they cannot move in bed and the parents must be awake at night to move them at regular times, otherwise they get bed sores.  They are also prone to chest infections, and to heart difficulties and pneumonia.  This is a very serious problem affecting families and my heart goes out to the families with children affected with muscular dystrophy.As I stated, in the case of my cousin's family, the two boys died.  The two girls are carriers but they lead healthy lives.  Once when on holiday abroad with his parents one of the boys got mucous in his throat and almost choked.  There was an advanced paramedic in place and the lad recovered.  He was just 19 or 20 years old.  However, one of things he said to his mother was that if that happened again, he did not want to go on.This is just one story but it is the story of many other parents, some of whom are in the Gallery.  I urge the Government to adopt international standards in this area.  We must be part of international research as we do not have independent capacity in this matter.

It is only right to acknowledge the Government giving the time to discuss the motion here today.  It shows the seriousness with which it takes this issue.At the outset, I acknowledge the work of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and that of its CEO, Mr. Joe Mooney.  It is also only right to acknowledge that much work is done behind the scenes by a guy named Mr. Jimmy Mooney and the Lafferty family, who live close to him, on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  They have been fighting a long battle trying to get funding for this worthy cause.This issue, no different from any other disability issue, is close to the Tánaiste's heart.  She has been working on it for quite some time.  Even this morning she had meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney and the Minister, Deputy Harney, and work is ongoing on the matter.  In Donegal, Mr. Charlie McConlogue is very much keeping the Tánaiste's and my attention on the matter on a regular basis.  They are working on protocols and trying to alleviate difficulties that existed in getting funding to this worthy cause.  I am aware that the Tánaiste attended meetings with those involved in the Imperial College, London and look forward to a positive outcome.As has been outlined by Deputies here this morning, decisions will be made on funding in June.  I take comfort from the fact that guarantees have been given to MDI that there is no upper limit to the co-funding that could be allocated internationally. The assessment criteria that will be used by the panel were outlined to MDI as well: it must be excellent high-quality science; it must be innovative; it must have a relevance and impact on the disease; and the expertise must be from a research environment.  There was a fairly thorough meeting between the HRB and Mr. Mooney.  I am confident that the Ministers involved, and the Tánaiste, are doing all in their power to ensure that adequate funding is provided for this worthy cause and work will continue in that regard.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I thank Deputy Blaney for sharing his time with me.  At the outset, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who is doing a wonderful job in a challenging and difficult brief.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important motion.Muscular dystrophy is a very disabling condition.  Unlike many conditions in medicine, unfortunately, it does not have a cure.  In that regard we know the fate that stares in the face of those who are unfortunate enough to have this condition.It is difficult to estimate the number of patients who are affected by muscular dystrophy.  Muscular Dystrophy Ireland informs me that it has 509 members but is aware that there are persons with the condition who are not members of the organisation.Within that group there are 88 who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy which, as the House will be aware, is a much more virulent or aggressive disease for which there is no cure to date.  In that regard, the research being carried out in Ireland, the UK and across the world, is of vital importance.Sadly, many of those with muscular dystrophy, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy, have a life expectancy up to the early 20s at most.  This is definitely an improvement on what happened in the past but it is still a frightening thought that, unfortunately, somebody who has such a condition will be dead by their early 20s.  I would urge the Health Research Board and the Department to find some mechanism whereby the research being carried out, particularly the exon skipping research in the United Kingdom, can be funded to some extent from this country.  I am aware there are difficulties in getting the funding to the UK.  There is a considerable amount of goodwill for the Department on this issue and I urge everyone involved to try to resolve it.We must be cognisant of our economic situation.  In this regard, the suggestions that I shall make in the few minutes remaining are designed to try to improve the lot of people with muscular dystrophy.  Since the pool of people with muscular dystrophy is so small, I appeal for each to be given a medical card.  If my estimates are right, we are discussing a maximum of 600 or 650 people.  Many already have medical cards.  From my discussions with some of the people with this condition, their families and those involved, however, I understand that the provision of a medical card to those who have none would be of great psychological and medical benefit.  I request that all sufferers be granted a medical card.Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government consider a mechanism whereby housing modification grants could be prioritised for people to muscular dystrophy?  They need their housing adapted, as most, if not all, will be wheelchair-bound by a certain point.  While there are pressing financial constraints on all grants, I appeal to the Minister to consider as a matter of urgency the provision of a housing grant to the group in question.  Normally, there is a time lag between when people first apply for housing grants and when they are granted.  The unfortunate people under discussion do not have that time at their disposal.We need more neurologists.  I am delighted that the Minister for Health and Children has obtained the agreement of the medical consultants group in that respect.  I appeal to her to make the provision of neurologists and their backup teams at various locations a priority.  The people involved in the treatment of muscular dystrophy are essentially based in Dublin, but sufferers are scattered throughout the State.  I make these requests in recognition of the country's financial situation.

I have been briefed by a number of families and there is no doubt that the disease is a heartbreaking one.  I am told that it affects approximately 150 boys and is seemingly on the increase.  As this particular strain of muscular dystrophy is not well known among the public, a reason for today's debate is to raise awareness.  The disease's debilitating characteristics claim young lives, usually before they reach 20 years of age.Thankfully, there is a little bit of good news for the boys who suffer this disease.  Parents and families hope for good news when they get up every morning.  If Deputy McHugh's suggestions become a reality, the beam of light at the end of the tunnel will grow a little.  I must put on record the great efforts of Duchenne Ireland, the organisation in question, for raising more than €300,000, a large amount of money for the small number of people involved.As has been pointed out, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD, is one of the world's lethal childhood genetic diseases.  The research being carried out in NUI Maynooth seems to provide a promising new approach to the disease's treatment.  Coupled with the work under way in the UK, there is reason for hope.  If either side of the House can do nothing else except push the idea that there will be a major breakthrough for the families and sufferers some day, today will have been worthwhile.In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, would be the person on the Government side most likely to push this issue.  However, I hope that the Minister for Health and Children is listening to the debate.  To put it bluntly, I had expected her to be sitting across from me.  That is her role and it is important that she and the HSE hear everything that we have mentioned.  I believe the Minister of State has compassion for this issue, as much is necessary.Many of the families in the Visitors Gallery are visiting Dáil Éireann for the first time and cannot understand why the motion will be voted on.  Given the fact that Deputy McHugh has striven to address this issue for a long time, I expected the Government's acceptance of his Bill without significant reservations and the Deputies of this assembly to act in unison to help the people affected.  They have a long road ahead of them.  It is a pity that there must be a vote.  Even so, I hope that we have raised the profiles of the disease and those involved.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I thank my colleagues for speaking on this motion and for their insights.  Over recent days, I have learned of a few personal stories and connections of some Deputies on this side of the House.  I also thank my colleagues in the Labour Party and Sinn Féin for trying to bring magnanimity to the debate.  I acknowledge the role of the Government, which has given time to its motion.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, for doing this and the backbenchers' participation.We must move forward through constructive negotiation via the Health Research Board, HRB, the Department and the Government.  For the affected persons in the Visitors Gallery and those who are listening, the greatest injustice that we as parliamentarians could do them would be to leave the issue alone after today, to make points and to give false hopes and expectations.  We should have a deep cognisance of whether we go down that dangerous road after this motion.The issue comprises three elements, which have been addressed.  We are considering the possibility of introducing EU and international standards.  Deputy Connaughton, a representative from the west and a farmer, knows all about my next point.  Why is it that every time an EU directive on best practice in animal husbandry or fisheries sustainability lands on the desk of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or, as Deputy Perry is aware from his time as a committee vice chairman, the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, our nation jumps to implement it?  In this case, if we introduced a single element of international standards and care, everything else would fall into place.There is not even an official register.  The number of 88 boys has been mentioned, but anecdotal evidence and information from Duchenne Ireland refers to 150 boys.  We need to get them on the register.  When we cross the Border into Northern Ireland there is a register but there is none here.  Why is that the case?  The Minister of State should forget about the funding issue and looking for extra money in these recessionary times.  That is not the issue.  The issue is about introducing international care standards.I would like to leave the Minister of State with one example, that of Darren McDonagh, whose anniversary occurs this year.  Darren was from Buncrana in County Donegal and 13 months ago he travelled to Buswells Hotel to campaign for DMD research and a clinical trial site in this country, when he was 16 or 17 years old.  He knew his time was coming near an end, but in his name, with the support and consent of his parents, he still wanted to campaign for the boys that still have a chance and some hope.  Regarding the best care and standards, is it right that while Darren was going through his last number of years, during which time his health was declining, that he had to leave Donegal at 4 a.m. for an appointment in Dublin at 9 a.m.?  When he arrived for his appointment at 9 a.m., he still was not given priority because DMD is not prioritised under our national rules for the prioritisation of medical support.  He would have arrived back in Buncrana at midnight.Should we allow our boys to sit in a wheelchair for 20 hours?  That is what he had to go through. To honour his memory his parents wished for the campaign to be continued and this is where we should keep the focus.  I am seeking solidarity on this issue and a magnanimous nature to the debate.  I appreciate the input from Members on both sides of the House, but we have to keep this issue moving forward.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I thank Deputy McHugh for giving us all in the House the opportunity to deal with a very real issue.  In his closing comments, the Deputy asked for solidarity.  There is no doubt in my mind, having spoken to my colleagues, that solidarity is forthcoming from this side of the House.  I respect the point made byDeputy Connaughton that the House will have to divide when this debate concludes.  That is procedural and will not, in any way, stop us from continuing to give support to Deputy McHugh, to parents and others who are dealing with a very difficult situation in looking after their boys.This debate is creating awareness.  It is an issue that concerns constituents of ours all around the country.  Like other speakers, I only became aware of this condition when parents visited me and asked for help and support.  One area in which we can help is to deal with the inconsistency in the HSE in different parts of the country.  Invariably, if we hear debates on radio, we hear parents making the point that in some old health board areas support is forthcoming, but in others that is not always the case.Deputy Devins called for the automatic entitlement to a medical card for such people, and I fully support that.  When young boys are diagnosed with this condition, they should at the very least have an automatic entitlement to a medical card and their parents who, God knows, have a difficult enough cross to carry, should not have to present accounts and payslips and undergo the rigours of a means test.  That is one measure which could be put in place very quickly.  The numbers, thankfully, are small, but one is one too many, and this is one measure we could introduce to assist these parents.In many instances parents will be forced to adapt their homes for their boys.  I again ask the State to give support and make it easier for parents to avail of grant aid to have such work carried out.  I respect the fact that we are living in a very difficult economic climate and I understand there are limits to our resources.  We spend €16 billion annually on health services and, within that, we must have priorities.  There is no better case for priority than those suffering from muscular dystrophy.Another area where I have tried to assist parents is that of E112 forms for foreign travel.  In many instances, we do not have the expertise here to treat these boys and they have to travel to England for treatment.  The support should be automatic for these children to travel for diagnosis and for treatment.  This is another way in which we could help.I am concentrating on three or four practical issues that affect parents on a daily basis.  I compliment Muscular Dystrophy Ireland on the tremendous work it does.  It gives support to these parents when perhaps it is not always forthcoming from the State.I also want to mention the Health Research Board, which could also offer support.  It works with Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and many other groups and  I welcome the funding for the continued research that is required to help extend the lives of sufferers.  I hope we will soon see this disability being dealt with in a way in which lives can be saved.I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  He is the line Minister for people with disabilities and is doing an excellent job because he is hands-on meeting different groups.  I again appeal to him to give the required support to these sufferers.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I do not want to just go through the motion of thanking Deputies because I recognise the concerns of Deputies on both sides of the House.  I thank those who tabled the motion.To pick up on Deputy Jan O’Sullivan’s point, I recognise the involvement of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in this area.  Seldom have I seen motions come before the House from a committee, but this one originated in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.I have one small issue.  I feel the demeanour, concerns and sincerity of the House and I could not destroy that.  However, I cannot accept Deputy Ó Caoláin's observation that my counter-motion is self-congratulatory.  It is far from it.  I do not take solace from the fact we had to deal with this issue here today.  The counter-motion is a response or clarification of where the Government stands, and is no more than that.I want to deal with the heart of the issue, rather than waffling on.  There is no contest regarding the issue of supporting research in this area.  Research has been and will continue to be carried out.  It is a pity we should divide, but I understand Members need to bring some clarity to this issue.  I am not just responding to this motion.  This issue, like all demands for disability and financial support, is ongoing.Last November the issue became clear to me and the Tánaiste asked me to talk about meeting the group and I intend, further to this debate, to meet members of that group.  I accept that request.  I am not meeting them for the sake of it.  That is not the position.  It is a meeting to bring clarity.Deputy McHugh talked about international care standards.  I am somewhat confused.  Are we also talking about international research standards?  I believed we bought into and accepted the fact that we must have international research standards.  Forgive me if it appears I am trying to distance the Department's position from this.  Far from it.  Unless we buy into, support and grant aid international research standards, clearly we could not carry out research in this country alone given the number of people affected, as it would not bring about the productive results we require.  We must take that approach in the Department.  We have done it and we will continue to do so.I wish to bring some clarity to the issue.  Reference was made to the register and I would prefer to develop that issue.  I am not asking the Opposition to pull back from putting the motion to a vote, far from it, but after today the matter will still be ongoing.  The specific point I was asked about was further funding for research.  I will continue to fund research.  I made the point in my opening statement that the call goes out on a regular basis from the research board.  I understand the next date when independent experts will decide on what research projects to support is in June.  I hope the specific research project we are discussing will be prioritised.In order to be helpful but without interfering in that independent process, I am prepared to meet the representatives of Duchenne Ireland as soon as possible in the coming days.  I wish to clarify whether the group's concern is international care or international research.  I reaffirm the Government's commitment to supporting research.  I could not have said in my prepared script and opening remarks that we are all about research if we are confining the research to this country alone.  We have to go the necessary distance to support this cause.I accept the points made by Deputy Breen in particular.  I have no direct family member who is affected but, like other Members of the House I am aware of families that are affected.  There are many demands for further funding in the disability area but I see the necessity of funding for this disease from the points made by Members, including Deputy Blaney and the Tánaiste, whom I met some months ago.  Research has indicated that the disease can be ameliorated through further research and clinical trials.  Reference was made to the register.  Are we talking about people registering to go forward for clinical trials?  If that is the case, it must be done on a voluntary basis and safeguards and protocols must be built into such a system.I accept the point that there is little time for those who suffer, but it is essential that we bring clarity to the issues raised, namely the types of research, the involvement of clinical trials, and what we are being asked to do.  I do not say that in an effort to prevent Members dividing the House but I cannot give a commitment until I work out what clinical trials are involved.  The fact that we did not support clinical trials funding last year may have given rise to the notion that we are ceasing to fund research.  I assure everybody of our continued commitment in that regard.Many other points were raised and I would like to have had the time to address them.  It is important to talk about the cost of disability payments.  Perhaps we can discuss the issue further on another day but I am not sure when that would take place.  It is important to bring clarity on the cost of disability payments.I was taken by Deputy McHugh's reference to the case of Darren McDonagh.  Although it is not much help, my sympathies go out to him.  I accept it is poor practice for a child to have to travel from Donegal.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has been stressing for some time the importance of standards of hospital care.  I would not even pretend to offer an excuse for anybody having to withstand what Darren did, especially in the year of disability.I will try to bring some clarity to my summary remarks.  First, I recognise the huge contribution of Duchenne Ireland, which to date has raised €300,000.  I accept that the group is not prepared to stand aside and ask someone else to do the business.  In response to all the Members who have spoken today, it is clear that we must all be compassionate but demonstrate that by committing to and confirming our involvement in funding research.  That is why I have a difficulty with dividing the House in the context of our previous funding and our commitment to further funding.I might need time to clarify the ongoing proposals for funding, whether it is for clinical research or in terms of people volunteering for research.  I reaffirm my commitment to research.  The Government's motion points to the mechanisms that are in place to support research here and abroad and the supports it provides to provide health and personal services, in particular to people with a disability.  It is important to stress that.  The Government shares the concerns of Members.I wish to put on record a point on research.  I accept Deputy McHugh is concerned about research into the disease.  Systems are in place to support charities to develop research programmes relating in particular to rare diseases.  Deputy Connaughton made the point that this disease falls into that category.  Those mechanisms are operated through the Health Research Board, HRB, which is the statutory body for health research.  The scheme to support medical charities recognises and accommodates the fact that these research projects can be led predominantly outside of Ireland.  I cannot stress that point enough.  We should not be confining our research to this country.  International best practice must become part of the strategy.  We cannot do that unless we are part of international research in the first instance.To date, the Health Research Board, has supported Muscular Dystrophy Ireland through co-funding two research projects which advance the case for a reversal of the devastating effects of muscular dystrophy.  A new round of proposals for research is under way.  The HRB has supported Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and recently met and advised it on the development of its research proposals.  I wish to further elaborate on what are the specific research proposals.  The process of developing, considering, recommending, approving and funding new proposals for research should be completed within a couple of months.  With all sincerity, this information is not merely a response to the motion, the historical facts are available from the HRB and the Department of Health and Children that demonstrate their ongoing commitment.I will come to a conclusion as I am running out of time.  I hope that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland's proposals will receive a favourable assessment and every assistance will be given to it.  I will do all that I can, in conjunction with my officials, to support, promote and, I hope, get the go-ahead from the independent research board.I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  More important, I thank all those who travelled long distances to be present.  I hope they recognise that it is not just a political response that we are giving, it is a compassionate response based on the need to continue our research.

I am, however, no advocate of private health insurance.There is clearly a need to protect our health system from a predatory approach by health insurers which would see older people and people with illnesses being forced to pay higher health insurance premiums.  The most recent estimate has it that more than 50% of the population in this State subscribe to one of the private health insurance providers.  That is an estimate published in 2008, presumably based on 2007-08 figures.  I have no doubt that the figure for 2008-09 will show a  significant fall in the number of people covered by private health insurance as a result of the recession.  We are seeing an ebb and flow, with profound consequences for our health services.During the Celtic tiger years, increasing numbers of people took out private health insurance, as reflected in the figure I have quoted.  I believe this happened for two reasons.  First, incomes increased and as a result many more people could afford, albeit with great difficulty in many cases, to pay for private health insurance.  Second, and most important, the Government had allowed our public health services to deteriorate so much that many people believed they needed the added cover provided by private health insurance, despite its burdensome financial cost.  I believe we are now seeing a turning of the tide.The astronomical rise in unemployment is resulting in more people applying for medical cards, the cancellation of private health insurance and ever greater demands on the public health services.  These services, because of the fundamentally flawed policies and disastrous mismanagement of our health service by successive Governments, are almost at breaking point.  The cuts imposed since autumn 2007, and greatly increased cuts this year, are creating a crisis situation.  While I accept the word "crisis" is often over-used, I challenge anyone to deny the crisis in respect of our health services.Coupled with the cuts across all the health services, there is a concerted attack on the delivery of hospital services at local level.  This week, the people of Cork and Kerry were shocked to hear what the HSE has in store for their local hospitals with Tralee, Mallow, Bantry, the South Infirmary and the Mercy Hospitals to be downgraded.  The people of Monaghan warned people across the State what was coming down the tracks.  We face the removal from 31 May, ten days from now, of all acute inpatient services from our hospital, Monaghan General Hospital.  I take this opportunity to make a last minute appeal through the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, and her officials to the Minister for Health and Children to intervene to prevent this disastrous move which will have calamitous consequences for my community and the people of County Monaghan.The great tragedy is that the period of the Celtic tiger presented successive Government with an unprecedented, and probably never to be repeated, opportunity to transform our health system.  That transformation is still necessary and will have to be achieved but it will be done in much more difficult financial circumstances.  Pending such transformation, this Bill is yet another measure to patch up the inequitable, ramshackle and inefficient health service in this State. Many years ago former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, boasted that the system "with its integrated mix of public and private care, has served the nation well".  He clearly admitted that it was a two-tier system.  We do not get such frank admissions from Government these days.  However, the two-tier system is more entrenched than it ever was.  It is also more complex, more inequitable and infinitely more costly.It is interesting to read the response of the Minister for Health and Children when concerns were raised in the Seanad last year about the prospect of VHI privatisation.  She made the following statement: "If one has private health insurance, one has preferential access to diagnostics and facilities paid for by the taxpayer and for which a group of employees in this State gets a fee."  The Minister appeared to speak disapprovingly of this preferential access, yet she has done everything to maintain it.  This is the two-tier system.  In 2005, the Minister said the fact that "more and more people are getting private health care is a good thing.  It is a sign of increasing disposable income".  The Minister did not say that the increasing number of people taking out private health insurance was also, as I have pointed out, a sign that people were moving away from the public health system because of long waiting lists and loss of confidence.  A vicious circle was created.  The public health system was allowed to deteriorate, which prompted more people to choose private care.  The for-profit health sector grew richer as the Minister intended and the Government has fattened that for-profit health care business as never before.Many uninsured people also abandoned the public system and went into debt to pay for private care in order to avoid long waiting lists.  Credit unions reported growing numbers of people taking out loans to fund health care.  For example €30 million was lent in this way in 2004.  However, as I have said, the tide has turned.  Now the price is being paid in a sub-standard public health service on which growing numbers of people are becoming totally dependent.The reality is that we do not know the total amount of money we spend as a society on health services.  The Minister and her Department seem to be as ignorant about this fact as everyone else.  We know that the best use is not being made of this money because it is being applied inequitably and inefficiently in a two-tier system.  Approximately 70% of the population have long been paying for their health care twice — once through taxes and again through personal health insurance or direct user fees for GP services, medicines and hospital care.  This complex and inefficient funding system has been used by successive Governments to underpin the grossly inequitable two-tier public-private system.We in Sinn Féin have called for the establishment of a health funding commission which would assess all the money being spent on health services both by Government and by citizens in the form of health insurance premiums and user fees.  This commission would not be engaged in a statistical exercise.  Its purpose would be to plan the transition to a truly fair and efficient system.  Surely that must be the shared objective of all who believe in health care justice on this island.  In our strong view the way forward is a universal, single-tier system of health care accessible to all based on need alone and regardless of income or where we live.  Such a system would be funded from general taxation based on the principle of ability to pay.  It would protect the most vulnerable and ensure that there was no fast-track to better care for some while others languished on waiting lists.  The best care should be available to all on the basis of need.There are very few winners in our current inequitable health care system.  The exceptions are those who profit from the increasingly lucrative private health business.  Overall, our population suffers an inequitable and inefficient system.  Its fundamental structure is flawed and it is plagued with bad political and bureaucratic management.  A new beginning is needed and health funding is central to that.  We need a much wider debate than can be facilitated by this Bill.  The Celtic tiger is dead and we are now facing a devastating recession with health services that are still organised on the basis of an inequitable and inefficient, two-tier, public-private system.  If this does not change then recession will greatly increase that inequity and inefficiency.  Those with wealth will be looked after by the private system which the Government has built up, while the majority dependent on the public health system will face longer waiting times, fewer hospital beds, staff cuts, closure of local hospitals and reduction of services in the community.  We are seeing that happen every week.Sinn Féin has a different vision.  We believe that health care is a fundamental human right.  We need to ensure that everyone has equal access to health services that are both equitable and efficient.  We also need to ensure that factors which lead to poor health for many people, including social and economic inequality, are tackled effectively.  Studies in Ireland and worldwide have shown that those with less wealth are far more likely to suffer illness and premature death than more privileged sections of society.  Therefore, Sinn Féin views health not just as an absence of illness but, in line with the World Health Organisation, as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being" and the enjoyment of health "is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction".We translate our vision for the health services into three key proposals: a new universal public health system for Ireland that provides care to all free at the point of delivery, on the basis of need alone, and funded from general fair and progressive taxation; fundamental re-orientation of the health system to adopt a central focus on prevention, health promotion and primary care, including mental health care, and on ultimately eliminating the underlying social and structural causes of ill-health and premature death, such as poverty and inequality; and immediate establishment of a health funding commission to report within a reasonable timeframe on the projected costs of the transition to an all-island system of universal provision, taking into account all spending on health services under the current systems, including direct Government spending and spending on health insurance.Clearly, our key funding proposal requires a fair and progressive taxation system based on ability to pay.  We seek a single-tier system and this would mean that State funding for the private for-profit health sector would be ended.  I commend these proposals to the Minister and I recognise that the path to achieving each of these goals, which will be clearly in the interest of all citizens throughout the island of Ireland, will take time.  In the interim I use the opportunity today on behalf of everyone in communities throughout the State who are afraid, deeply concerned and worried facing the loss of critical services from our network of local hospitals to appeal the Minister to take the appropriate action to ensure that these services will continue.On behalf of my community in Monaghan, which was selected many years ago as the first test case for the reduction of services in hospitals throughout the State and is now facing the loss of the last acute facility in Monaghan General Hospital by the end of the month, I appeal to the Government once again to pull back, to have sense and to recognise that the people of the county, small in number though they may be, are entitled to equitable access to the critical services on which I, as but one citizen among their number, have depended for my life and to be able to participate today.  In God's name, do not proceed with the closure of acute medical services at Monaghan General Hospital.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I would like to take this opportunity to respond to issues raised by Deputies on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.Deputy Reilly spoke about the strong regulation that exists in the Netherlands.  The reality is that the strongest part of the regulatory framework in the Netherlands is its risk equalisation scheme, which aims at removing perverse incentives for insurers to pursue strategies that would make them less attractive to the elderly and the ill.  The Deputy is aware that the health insurance market in the Netherlands operates with a risk equalisation scheme and a minimum level of cover.  As he pointed out, the authorities in that country have managed to make the elderly, chronically ill and diabetics more attractive to insurers who have gone after that market.  This was achieved through risk equalisation because other elements of the regulatory framework cannot give this result.Deputies raised the question of the relationship between current employment trends and private health insurance costs to employers.  The number of people with health insurance has increased in line with employment growth but, given the current economic climate, a fall in numbers taking out cover is likely and there is some evidence of a small decline in the insured population during the first quarter of 2009.  Factors contributing to this decline include the closure or downsizing of companies which paid private health insurance on behalf of their employees or made contributions thereto and individuals who had been paying for their insurance and find themselves out of work.  However, the cost of health insurance for employers has to be considered in the context of the overall aim of the scheme and maintaining intergenerational solidarity in particular.  The overall effect of the levy and credit is neutral.  Where premia have been increased by insurers, this simply reflects the age profiles of the insurers concerned and the fact that in the absence of a risk equalisation mechanism they have not been contributing to intergenerational solidarity across the insured population.  The reality is that all persons in a community rated market should be paying a premium that supports the application of community rated health insurance across the entire market.  As stated on Tuesday, amendments to address technical issues relating to the operation of the scheme and other issues raised by the industry will be brought forward on Committee and Report Stages.With regard to the Deputies' inquiries on premium price increases following the announcement of the levy and credit, the Minister has no role to play in the setting of prices by any health insurance provider.   This is a commercial decision for the insurer concerned.  The level of increase at the start of this year was influenced primarily by the additional cost pressures insurers faced due to medical inflation, the increase in capacity in the private sector and the move towards economic pricing of public pay beds.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I cannot agree.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The scheme will counter perverse incentives for insurers to focus on younger age groups, with insured persons less likely to face higher increases or product segmentation related to their age.Deputies also raised the issue of possible overcompensation for the VHI.  The purpose of the scheme is not to compensate the VHI but to continue making health insurance affordable for older people and those with poorer health. Under the scheme individuals aged 50 years and older receive the tax relief irrespective of their insurers.  The VHI has a significantly older age profile than the other two insurers.  Furthermore, having regard to proportionality, the scheme has been designed so that it only partially compensates VHI.  The Minister will on Committee Stage be bringing forward amendments to section 9(3) to give the Health Insurance Authority greater direction on the evaluation and analysis of the data it will be getting from the insurers and which will form the basis for the levy and credit in subsequent years.With regard to the profits announced by VHI, the figures quoted refer to the annual returns for the year ending February 2008.  The more recent returns covering the ten months to the end of December 2008 show that VHI was loss making, hence the level of premium increase it had to put in place at the start of this year.Deputies raised the issue of the cost of health insurance for families, the cost of the levy for children and the position on waiting periods where higher levels of cover are taken out.  Setting the levy at one third of the adult rate, or €53, recognises that the premium charged for children is significantly less than the adult price and that under the Health Insurance Acts the maximum amount that can be charged is 50% of the adult premium.  The open enrolment regulations allow insurers to apply waiting periods when an insured person avails of higher levels of cover.  This is a necessary protection for the insurers.  Currently the waiting periods, which only apply to the additional elements of cover, are two years for a person under the age of 65 when first named under the higher contract or five years for a person of or over the age of 65 years.  These waiting periods are being reviewed in the context of the preparation of the lifetime community rating regulations which will be put before the Houses for approval in the autumn.Deputies also raised the issue of the possible size of the premium increases for over 60s in the absence of the scheme.  It was incorrectly asserted this could not have taken place in a community rated system.  Specifically targeted multiple products that provide different levels of cover above the minimum benefit for different types of conditions or higher priced products for older people and cheaper products targeting younger people lead to a fragmented market.  These plans could still have been community rated in that they could have been made available in principle to all persons at the same price while in practice not being appropriate to all age groups or types of health status.  This interim scheme and the longer term robust risk equalisation scheme will remove this incentive for fragmentation and support intergenerational solidarity, making the elderly, chronically ill and diabetics more attractive to the insurers who have gone after that market.Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked why we are not bringing in the long-term scheme at this juncture.  Having regard to the Deputy's point in regard to bringing forward a revised risk equalisation scheme at this time, the Bill before us is a specific response aimed at supporting the key principles of the market.  Work on a long-term risk equalisation scheme will intensify following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  It was not feasible to amend the previous scheme in the short term as, in addition to the specific issue on which the Supreme Court ruled, a range of other issues had also been put before the courts which would have to have been considered in bringing forward any amendments to the previous scheme.I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  While the Bill contains two provisions which have attracted public attention, namely, the levy and credit, it is also important to bear in mind that the other key provisions in the Bill which reinforce the concept of intergenerational solidarity, community rated health insurance and the protection of older people are at the core of the health insurance system and strengthen the regulatory functions of the Health Insurance Authority on consumer protection.It is intended that Committee Stage of the Bill shall be taken on Tuesday, 9 June 2009.

The hospital is committed to providing the full level of services that it promised in its 2009 service plan.  The top priority will be to protect patient care.So far this year, Crumlin hospital has delivered more treatments to patients than in the same period last year.  In the first three months of 2009, there were 2,745 treatments for children as inpatients and 3,841 as day cases, an increase of 244 over 2008.  Crumlin also had 21,252 attendances at the outpatient department, an increase of 1,041 from the first quarter of last year.The 2009 allocation to Crumlin is €139.6 million, an increase of some 39% over the past five years.  This includes a reduction of 3% this year over 2008 in line with the budgetary constraints facing the entire public sector and the wider economy.  A particular challenge for the hospital is that it is operating at some 100 posts above its employment ceiling.  It employed 1,650 people at the end of March compared with an approved 1,550.  This contributes to its current financial difficulties.The HSE is working closely with Crumlin hospital to achieve an agreed programme of savings totalling €6.5 million this year.  The focus of these savings will be on non-pay areas of expenditure and on protecting front-line services.  On this basis, the HSE believes the hospital will achieve a break-even position this year.We need to consider more strategically the way in which we provide paediatric services in Dublin.  In 2009, the Government will provide more than €250 million for the running of three paediatric hospitals in the Dublin area.  We can achieve significant cost savings if services and practices are more closely integrated across the three hospital sites, even before the new national paediatric hospital has been completed.  With this in mind, the HSE is pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put into patient care.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The Minister has had a long time to consider how to make the hospitals more efficient.  The issue before the House is of serious concern to people across the country, no more so than the Deputy on my right, Catherine Byrne, whose constituency contains the hospital in question.Crumlin hospital looks after 80% of children's tertiary needs.  The Minister was right to point out that it has increased its activity and efficiency, but this was necessary in light of the increasing population.  The Minister acknowledged this fact by increasing the allocation to the maternity hospitals.The Minister does not seem to have taken into account some of the newer technologies that are available, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which has reduced the cardiac surgery death rate by nearly half.  The hospital was given no extra money in this regard.  There is a growing number of cardiac conditions that, unlike previously, are now treatable, such as hyperplastic left heart syndrome.  The incidence of sickle cell disease has increased significantly, resulting in Crumlin hospital having the largest outpatient clinics for that illness in Europe.Why is the Government spending €5 million per year on a virtual new hospital, which no one believes will proceed in the current economic climate, when it is enforcing cutbacks at the very hospital delivering care today?  Since all Cork orthopaedic operations are to be brought to Crumlin, any delay in scoliosis operations will result in children having two operations, leading to tremendous suffering.  How much——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Regarding the last point, we need a new hospital badly.  If there is no single new hospital, major work will need to be done at the Temple Street Children's Hospital, which is not fit for purpose, and at Crumlin hospital.  The decision was made two years ago, the project is proceeding, money will be provided and there is a great deal of interest in making provision for the hospital.As I recently stated in the House, the HSE has shown that a minimum of €25 million per year can be saved in duplication costs by combining the three hospitals.  Much work has been undertaken to bring them closer together.  There will be a joint department of surgery and seven surgeons.  There are five currently, one of whom is retiring, so the increase will be two.  The surgeons will work in at least two of the hospitals.  There will be a single paediatric critical care service between Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals, the implementation of which will be overseen by Dr. Des Bohn of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  Much work is under way.As I have stated in the House previously, three accident and emergency departments will be open in this city between midnight and 8 a.m. tonight, with theatres and staff on call.  On average, they see approximately 29 patients between them.  I had a good meeting recently with Professor Brendan Drumm and some of Crumlin hospital's medical team, led by Dr. Pat Doherty, the chairman of the hospital's medical board, Dr. Michael McDermott and others to discuss how to better integrate services and paediatric services generally in the Dublin area.Next week, a new clinical affairs director, a doctor, will start at the HSE.  Bringing clinicians further into the management of services such as paediatrics will greatly help to get better value for money and more services for patients.

However, they fail to answer the questions of why we are cutting front-line services to children, why the money cannot be found elsewhere and why we are spending money on a virtual hospital when the existing hospital is being put under such strain.  New PR people are to be appointed to the virtual hospital's team.  Yet again, the Government seems to be more interested in spending money on spin than on service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Since 2005, we have increased the budget to Crumlin hospital by39%, which is considerable. We are not engaged in spin. A significant amount of work is under way by the development board to put in place the new children's hospital.I compliment the chairman of Crumlin hospital, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, on his tremendous work in trying to advance the project.  It does not meet with universal approval, but everyone knows that, were we to establish a paediatric service for the city and country, we would not start from our current position.  We must improve on the situation with a modern, state-of-the-art facility co-located with an adult teaching hospital.  This aim is being pursued and will be achieved.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	188	According to a 2008 HSE survey, 6,473 cases were unallocated at the end of 2008.  However, all such cases are managed by a social work team leader or principal social worker.  The majority of unallocated cases are also receiving input from other members of the staff in that department, such as family support workers.  All child abuse reports are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment by a social worker under the supervision of a team leader and I am informed by the HSE that all cases where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child are provided with services.Regarding staffing levels, social workers are exempted from the Government's moratorium on recruitment.  Proposals for an ICT system to support social work services for children has received HSE approval and is with the Department of Finance for review.  If approved, the objective is to have this system operating as quickly as possible to enable better exchange of information and improved communication between relevant staff throughout the HSE.As regards out of hours services, the HSE is putting in place a nationwide system, whereby gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children at risk out of hours.  This service aims to ensure that such children are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety, thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting.In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated multidisciplinary approach, which builds on the HSE's existing out of hours services, including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services, with access to specialist staff working in areas such as mental health and suicide prevention.

We do not have that kind of abuse any more in schools or institutions because, thankfully, we have learned lessons and moved on.However, with more than 6,400 children at risk without an allocated social worker, I must put to the Minister of State there is a danger that in future we will find the scandal of child abuse will be in family homes and other places where children live because there are not adequate resources for social workers.  Does the Minister of State agree?  The Sophia McColgan case is an example of where, if the powers that be do not intervene in families, we could have similar situations going on.Will the Minister of State and the Government reconsider not having a proper out of hours social work service in place?  The proposal under the Childcare Act that gardaí would move children into foster homes is not adequate.  How can it be adequate?  One listens to foster parents saying they do not have access to social workers whom they need.  Putting children into foster homes who do not have access to social workers simply will not work.  Will the Minister of State reconsider that decision?In his reply, he referred to the fact that if children are at immediate or serious risk, there will be intervention.  How does one know children are at immediate or serious risk if they do not have a social worker working with them?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I share with Deputy O'Sullivan the horror everybody who has read parts of the report to which she referred feels.  It makes for extremely harrowing reading.On her question on an out of hours service, 12 months ago a case came to light regarding a child who was in a Garda station overnight in Cork.  At that time, many people asked why there was no service where a phone could be picked up and a child placed appropriately until social work services were available.  That will be in place from next month.It does not mean a child will be placed in ordinary foster care families, rather, he or she will be placed in specially trained foster facilities until social work services are available.  They will be very short placements and it is not intended that such placements, made under section 12 of the 1991 Act, would last for more than two or three days before normal working hoursresume.The Deputy also asked if we could be satisfied that these events will never happen again.  Anybody will agree that the circumstances which pertained in the 20th century are left behind us.  We have a vastly improved system of child care compared to what happened before.  There are extremely dedicated staff and much better facilities.  The vast majority of children in care are in foster families.The details and recommendations of the report to which the Deputy referred underline the fact we have no cause for complacency.  It is an issue and area of great sensitivity.  It is emotive and we have to apply every resource, to the best of our ability, to this area.

Will the Government reconsider the decision it made in that regard?  It seems to be about money.  It is a relatively small amount of money.  I understand it is €15 million.  The HSE spent €17 million on consultants in the last year.

If there were 50 or 60 social workers employed, as would be required under the proposal made regarding an out of hours service, I would love to put them into the families most at risk and try to avoid a situation that leads to children coming into care.  There is not enough throughput to justify employing 50 or 60 social workers who would receive very irregular phone calls about children at risk.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Last year, hospital emergency departments treated 1.15 million people, of whom 368,000 were admitted to hospital.  In 2005 the average number of patients on trolleys awaiting admission each day was 259.  The average to date in 2009 is down to 141, and figures to date in May show a further reduction to 116.  Data collected by the HSE over recent months indicate that the vast majority of those patients requiring admission are transferred to the ward areas without undue delay.We need to continue to reduce waiting times for all patients presenting as emergencies to our hospitals.  With this in mind, the HSE has set a lower waiting time target of six hours for all patients in its 2009 service plan.  The aim is that all patients, irrespective of whether they are admitted or not, will be assessed, treated and discharged or admitted within six hours of arrival.The HSE is working to measure and report on the time it takes to manage each patient's care from the point of arrival in the emergency department until they are discharged or admitted.  As an interim measure, a sampling approach is being adopted at a selected time period each day, which involves collecting registration, admission and discharge data from emergency departments at all hospitals, either electronically or manually.Preliminary results from the HSE's performance monitoring reports for March 2009 for a sample of 19 hospitals indicate that of all patients who did not require admission, 92% were seen and discharged within six hours.  Approximately one third of patients who attend emergency departments are admitted to hospital.  Currently, almost half of these patients are admitted to the ward within the new maximum target time of six hours.  The challenge for hospitals is to ensure this new target is reached for all patients.I am confident the introduction of the fair deal in September this year will have a positive impact on the number of patients in hospital whose discharge has been delayed.  As a result of the introduction of the new scheme, nursing home care will be more affordable and acute beds will be freed up for acute patients.There have been significant improvements and we will continue to work for more progress by reducing inappropriate admissions, reducing average length of stay and moving activity from inpatient to day case procedures.  These measures will be essential in further improving the experience for patients attending emergency departments.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	196	It is now three years since the Minister, Deputy Harney, declared the problems in accident and emergency departments should be treated as a national emergency.  She set up an accident and emergency task force and its report was published in June 2007, notwithstanding the fact it was completed in 2006.  It set a date of 1 February 2007 to have determined a timeframe from which a maximum wait of six hours from arrival at accident and emergency department to admission or discharge will apply.What the Minister has just told us beggars belief.  She is trying to tell us the situation has improved.  The INO figures show it has not improved, but has disimproved.  At one stage last month there were 398 people on trolleys.  In the last week a very ill patient of mine sat on a chair for 18 hours awaiting admission and was then put onto a trolley.  I do not know how many more hours she spent on a trolley because I have not checked.We get answers saying everything is fine and hunky dorey, and things are moving apace, but the reality for people on the ground is different.  At one stage some weeks ago, 50 people were on trolleys in the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital.  Let us deal with reality.Instead of talking about what she might do in the future, why does the Minister not use the existing beds available in the greater Dublin area for long-term care and alleviate the congestion?  I have a newspaper article from last which refers to an approximately 50% increase in "bed-blockers", as it pejoratively refers to them.  They are people who are inappropriately trapped in wards.  Up to 757 patients a week cannot get discharged because there is nowhere for them to go.  That is what is causing the backlog in accident and emergency departments.  That matter is not being addressed.  I wish to ask the Minister a simple, straightforward question.  Why are we not using the existing long-term care beds that are available in the greater Dublin area to alleviate the problems of accident and emergency departments in Dublin?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I wish to offer a number of responses to what the Deputy said.  Everybody in the country acknowledges there have been significant improvements, including the INO, which has said so to me.  That is not to say challenges and difficulties do not remain, because they do.  One of the challenges is long-term care.  As Deputy Reilly is aware, a significant number of people in this city, in particular but not exclusively in Dublin, have finished their acute phase and have not yet moved to more appropriate settings.  The fair deal will bring equality of treatment between those in public nursing homes and private nursing homes.  I have no doubt it will greatly alleviate those pressure points.  Many of the people in acute hospitals are waiting for the introduction of the fair deal.  I understand Deputy Reilly's party opposed the introduction of the fair deal but nobody has put forward an alternative to it.  That will help in particular in the autumn of this year.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Our party has not opposed the fair deal yet.  The Minister should correct the record.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I got some literature from a Fine Gael candidate in the constituency in which I live saying that the party will not proceed with the fair deal.  I am not trying to make a political point.  I was surprised to see that because, in fairness, I think Deputy Reilly is supporting it and it has great support from older people and their relatives.  The introduction of the fair deal will greatly alleviate the pressure on acute hospitals.  We do not have the money to procure more beds in the private nursing home sector for the kind of numbers that require them.  It is not fair that 90% of the cost of care is paid for by the State if one is in a public bed or in a public facility but if one is in a private nursing home, on average, one has to pay 60% of the costs oneself.We have a question later about primary care.  There are a number of good pilot projects currently under way.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	200	We must move on but I wish to allow Deputy Reilly to ask a brief supplementary question.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I do not accept that we do not have the money.  We are spending approximately €5,000 a head in this country on health care while the spend in Holland is €4,000.  That country seems to be able to do it but we are not doing it.  I can only attribute that to the Minister.To what does the Minister refer in the context of the six-hour target?  Does she mean six hours from the time of arrival in an accident and emergency department?  That could not be true.  Does she mean six hours from the time the accident and emergency doctor decides a person needs admission, or is it six hours from the time the admitting doctor comes from elsewhere in the hospital, which could be 12 hours from a patient's original arrival in the accident and emergency department?  To which of the three does the Minister allude when she refers to patients being treated within six hours?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	202	In Holland, a visit to a GP is €24.80.  If we could have a similar cost in Ireland we would be able to do far more.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	203	What is the cost?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	204	GPs receive €24.80 for a visit to their practice and the cost of a telephone consultation is €12.40.  In comparing Holland to Ireland we need to compare like with like.I was talking about six hours from the time of arrival, not six hours from the time a patient is seen.  That is the new measurement tool.  A total of 92% of patients who attend accident and emergency departments in the 19 hospitals who do not require admission are seen within that six-hour timeframe.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	205	What about the ones who require admission?  They are the ones who are waiting on trolleys.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I do not believe that there will, in fact, be a loss of €50 million to public hospitals arising from the new consultants' contract, and I will set out the reasons.  A central objective of the new consultants' contract is to improve access for public patients to public hospital services.  It ensures, for example, for the first time in public hospitals, that patients needing outpatient or ambulatory diagnostic care will be seen on the basis of medical need, with no distinction between public and private status.Consultants holding the public-only, type A contract do not undertake any private work and no patient admitted under the care of such a consultant can be accorded private status.  Public hospitals may not, therefore, impose a private accommodation charge where a patient is admitted under the care of a type A consultant, nor may another consultant involved in the treatment of such a patient charge a fee.  Approximately 560 of 1,550 consultants who have accepted the new contract have this type A contract.Public hospitals earn income from health insurance companies for private patients admitted only to designated private beds.  The only way that the HSE could be at a loss of €50 million, as a result of the new consultants' contract, would be if designated private beds in public hospitals went unoccupied by private patients for a significant part of the year.  I do not expect that to happen, because approximately 1,400 consultants will still be in a position to treat private patients in public hospitals.  It can be expected that the 980 consultants on the new contract who are allowed private practice, plus the approximately 400 consultants remaining on the old contract, will continue to admit and treat sufficient numbers of patients, so that there will be little, if any, loss of private bed income to the hospitals concerned.  Thus, in practical terms, I do not expect a €50 million loss, or any material loss, to public hospitals as a result of the new contract.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Then the Minister disagrees with her Government colleagues who raised the matter at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not accept what she said, in the sense that if a person is admitted under a particular consultant who is on-call on the night, who is a type A consultant, that patient will be a public patient and that income will be lost to the hospital.  Time will tell which of us is right.Let us consider what has happened in the past, especially in regard to other undertakings that have been given, for example, the plan in 2008 to reduce the reliance on outside consultants.  In 2007, a total of €16.45 million was spent in that area and the princely sum of €100,000 was saved in 2008.  Can the Minister explain why additional funding for outside consultants is required when she has more than 113,000 people working in the HSE?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	208	There is a misunderstanding.  The hospital does not get a fee for every private patient who goes into a public hospital.  A hospital only gets a fee for a patient if he or she is in a designated bed and only approximately 20% of beds are private beds.  Sometimes half the numbers of patients in a hospital can be private patients but the hospital does not get any fee for them.  It can only charge the insurer for the people in the designated private beds.  That is a fact.  The doctor on the other hand can get a fee regardless of where a patient is located.  We sought to eliminate some of the perverse incentives that existed.  I make no apology for saying that if taxpayers fund a public hospital in the State, pay for the capital infrastructure, pay for all the staff and the diagnostics then there should not be preferential treatment for one class of citizen over another.The reliance on consultants is being reduced all the time.  Out of a €16 billion budget, by any standards the amount spent on outside consultants is relatively small.  We do not have all the expertise in the public sector.  It is not uncommon across the public sector in Ireland, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, and across Europe, including the Netherlands, for outside expertise to be recruited from time to time to advise and help.  It would not be cost effective to have that expertise within the public system.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I find it interesting that the Minister compares us to the North of Ireland, the United Kingdom and other countries.  It might be interesting to do a comparative study to find out what they spend on outside consultants in health, and also to compare the number of people they have working within their health service who are engaged in PR and other advisory roles.  Will the Minister carry out such a study?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The administrative costs of the Health Service Executive and the National Health Service, NHS, are approximately the same at 16% of the budget.  As Deputy Reilly is aware, the NHS is outsourcing a significant amount of activity to the private sector.  My point is that we should become less obsessed with whom pays whom to do what.  We should be more concerned with patients and getting access for patients to good quality treatment, which is what we are seeking to do.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I am not in a position to comment on any of the content of the report that has been redacted following legal advice, and that includes recommendations so affected.  I indicated at the outset that I was determined to publish as much of the report as was possible following legal advice and in the public interest, and that is the context in which the redacted report was published on 12 May 2009.  The report is very strong in its criticisms, and the Government is determined to meet its commitment to address issues around service provision for children and families most in need of assistance.The CEO of the HSE and the Garda Commissioner received the full report in their capacities as heads of the statutory bodies with responsibilities in regard to matters which were the subject of the inquiry.  It is intended that this will enable all the recommendations, including those redacted, to be addressed in so far as they apply to their respective organisations.  At the time of seeking legal advice I also asked for a determination in regard to the publication of the submissions appended to the report.  The legal advice I received was that the content of the submissions should not be published.  All the redactions in this report have been done solely on legal advice.  I am considering the option of apprising the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children of the substance of the redacted recommendations in a manner and context that ensures the rights of those involved are protected and no reputational damage is suffered.  That process is ongoing and I am seeking legal advice in that regard.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Can I put it to the Minister of State that the culture of secrecy and cover-up is alive and well in his Department?  Can I put it to him that it is the type of culture that led to the tragedies depicted in the report published by the commission yesterday?  Can I put to him that his response to this issue is an entirely institutional response and not a common sense human response on how matters should be dealt with?  This tragic case resulted in the lives of two children being taken.  The report that was published on it has disclosed serious systemic problems within our child care services of a nature that we have seen in other reports.In the report published yesterday, the Department of Education and Science was criticised for giving undue deference to the church and church bodies, and not giving priority to the welfare of children.  The congregations were criticised for giving priority to avoiding scandal and publicity as a consequence of the perpetration of abuse on children, rather than giving priority to the safety of children.  It seems that the priority of the Minister of State and the Government is to protect reputations of State agencies and State employees, and that is the reason given for not publishing this report and its recommendations in full.The priority that needs to be given is a priority to the welfare of children.  Will the Minister of State accept that he is not giving that priority?  There is no possibility of transparency or accountability in circumstances in which seven specific recommendations are blacked out of this report, which is the first time in the history of the State that this has happened.  An inquiry has been conducted and recommendations made to improve services or change laws — I do not know what is in them — have been censored and concealed from the public and from Members of this House.  The Minister of State's alternative suggestion of briefing a committee of the House is grossly inadequate.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I have said it before and I will repeat that I had no obligation to publish anything in this report.  I was anxious to publish as much of it as I could, subject to the legal advice that I received.  If we were in the business of cover up, none of the report would have been published.  The most hard hitting recommendations would not have been published.  Those parts that were not published were not published for specific, legal reasons and not for any other reason.  The suggestions by Deputy Shatter that we are in the business of protecting reputations at the expense of the welfare of children is a false dichotomy.  We must respect the fact that this was a non-statutory inquiry with which people co-operated on the understanding that no adverse findings would be made against individuals.I wanted to publish as much of the report as possible for both the public and health professionals to understand the circumstances that led to this terrible tragedy so that, in so far as possible, this would not happen again in the future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	214	One of the central recommendations of the report published yesterday by the commission of inquiry into child abuse was that "management at all levels should be accountable for the quality of services and care".  While the conclusions of this report were that even if the services had operated properly, the lives of the people concerned may not have been saved, nobody knows this for certain.  There were major failings within the services, such as a lack of communication, a lack of availability of professionals, and wrong judgments made.  The very out-of-hours service on which the Minister of State now wants to rely, whereby gardaí are to make judgments as to whether children should be taken temporarily into care on an emergency basis is contradicted by the report, which states that the gardaí did not regard themselves as qualified to make that assessment.  That was the reason given for the drive-by of the house of this tragic family by the gardaí who visited the house.For the Minister of State to suggest that he had no obligation to publish this report is to deny the fact that he is accountable to this House for children's services and social services that are applied to protect the welfare of children.  Is the Minister of State telling this House that no matter what happens with regard to the areas that fall within his remit, he is not accountable?  Will he accept that it was his predecessor and this Government who chose to make this a non-statutory inquiry?  A statutory inquiry could have been held within the framework of the new legislation enacted during Michael McDowell's time as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It would have created no difficulty.  In so far as there are legal difficulties, the redacted portion of the report, furnished by individuals in respect of whom some findings were made and allowing them to comment on it, addressed any such legal difficulties.The Minister of State's response is an institutional response obsessed with protecting reputations, with no concept that any State employee, any State agency or even the Minister of State himself are accountable to this House for the manner in which our social services and child care services are run.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I reject all of that.  I consider myself fully accountable to this House and to its committees.  I discharge my responsibility with a great seriousness.  I do not discharge it on an institutional basis, but to the best of my ability.  Deputy Shatter referred to section 12 of the Child Care Act and the obligation of the Garda Síochána.  That obligation exists and should be discharged.  The HSE needs to co-operate with the Garda Síochána, which was one of the issues that came up regarding Children First.  It is something on which we need to work all the time, to make sure that the relationship between the Garda and the HSE——
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Gardaí are getting no special training on how to operate on that.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	217	——and their obligations are understood among each other.The Ryan commission report is an absolute catalogue of failure and neglect by the State and religious congregations.  The Cabinet has undertaken to consider it next week, and a debate will take place in this House on 9 June.  We will be able to go into it in more detail then.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 74 together.The aim of the HSE's transformation programme is to have 530 primary care teams developed by 2011.  A total of 110 teams are in place at the moment.  The health professionals in these teams are holding clinical team meetings and delivering integrated comprehensive care to patients.  The HSE aims to have a further 100 teams in place by the end of 2009.  A number of these teams are at varying stages of development.  Many have initial team members identified, while some have staff assigned and are holding team development meetings.  The remaining 320 teams will be developed over the period up to 2011.The continued roll out of primary care teams will be achieved primarily by assigning existing professional and other staff working in primary, community and continuing care services to the teams.  Each local health office is developing plans to reconfigure existing community clinical and other staff in this way.  Over 850 health professionals have already been assigned to primary care teams and a further 2,700 staff have been identified who will work in primary care teams as the extra teams are rolled out.The moratorium on recruitment and promotion does not apply to allied health professionals such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers.  In fact, these will be increased in order to support the delivery of integrated services to groups like the elderly, children at risk and people with a disability.  The HSE also intends, as part of its overall transformation programme, to redeploy into community services a significant number of staff from acute hospitals and corporate functions.  The steps necessary to give effect to this are currently being finalised.A programme to lease 200 new primary care centres from the private sector was announced in the budget.  Primary care teams are using, and will continue to use, existing HSE buildings and some of the new centres will accommodate more than one primary care team.   The HSE board has already approved the commencement of negotiations in 150 locations and contracts are being finalised for 70 of these.  The first group of 80 is due to open next year and the full complement is due to open in 2011.

Listening to the answers given so far today one would think all is well with our health service when clearly it is a shambles, as evidenced by this attempt to put in place a virtual service in respect of primary care.  The reality is there are very few primary care teams delivering new services to patients.  The Minister referred to physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.  Practically all of those who qualified as physiotherapists last year are either unemployed, working in McDonalds and in petrol stations or gone abroad.We are only moving around the cushions on the deckchairs on the Titanic .  No new staff are being recruited.  No doubt the Minister will be able to point to one or two areas to which new staff have been recruited.  How many contracts have been signed this year in respect of the new centres?  It is no wonder the Minister can come up with hilarious language, such as “commencement of negotiations” given the number of PR gurus working for the HSE and in the Department of Health and Children.  We started this process in 2001 and in the middle of 2009 only ten primary care centres have been built.  At this rate, it will be the end of the 21st century before all are in place.  How many contracts have been signed this year with general practitioners?  Does the Minister accept at this rate of progress it will take decades to put in place all the centres, without which we cannot fix the health service?  What plans does she have to expedite this process?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I am the first to admit that all is not well in the health service.  That is the reason we are involved in a massive programme of transformation in terms of how we do things and the way people work.  Primary care is about bringing together under a new working arrangement existing health professionals who very often treat the same service users.  I recently visited Ballymun health centre, with which I believe the Deputy is familiar, where I heard firsthand from a public health nurse that, as a result of the bringing together of all services in a physical building, she had been able to cut down by about half of one day a week the length of time she spent on the telephone speaking to colleagues, social workers and other professionals.  This is about people working differently and together.The Deputy will be aware — I believe he supported the proposal — that the infrastructure will in the main be provided by the private sector.  There have been huge expressions of interest in the investment, which is worth approximately €1.5 billion.  The HSE board has approved 150 different locations and contractual arrangements have been put in place in respect of 70 locations.  Given this was only announced in the budget last year, it has been incredibly successful.  This is not alone about buildings but about existing health professionals working together.As I stated, we are moving to a situation whereby there will be recruitment this year of key therapists, who are not covered by the moratorium or the voluntary early retirement scheme.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	221	We all agree that primary care teams are good.  What is at issue is how to achieve them.  Perhaps the Minister would drop her ideology for a minute in dealing with this matter.  The Minister said it was stated in the budget that the private sector would provide premises and so on.  That is not working.  I know it is not working.  I know of general practitioners who are receiving letters from auctioneers asking if they would like to locate in particular primary care centres.Last week, the Joint Committee on Health and Children visited an excellent primary care centre in Mitchelstown, County Cork led by general practitioners from Mitchelstown.  It provides a number of services and works in co-operation with hospitals in the north Cork area and in Cork city.  It is really good.  A point made to me during that visit is that this service should be professional rather than developer led and it should be a not for profit service.I am asking the Minister to ensure a model is set up that works, involves the professionals who deliver health care and works for patients.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Deputy is wrong; the service is not developer-led.  Primary care centres cannot go ahead without general practitioner involvement.  That is a fact.  The Deputy will be aware that many of the successful projects have been promoted by general practitioners.  I note a facility involving practically all general practitioners in the Killarney area has just been refused planning permission, which is unfortunate.Who owns the building is not of concern to me nor, I believe, to patients.  The State does not have €1.5 billion to invest over the next couple of years in buildings for primary care teams.  I have no problem with general practitioners or general practitioners in conjunction with others, raising money to provide them, as has been done in some cases.  The key requirement is to have these teams in place as quickly as possible.  As I stated, currently 110 are in place and it is hoped that will increase to 200 by the end of the year.  Also, 2,700 people are currently in discussions in relation to working on those teams.  These are people currently employed by the public health service.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Enhanced primary care teams have been presented as a way of addressing overcrowding in hospitals and, unbelievably, as a substitute for acute hospital care in the context of the downgrading of local hospitals in areas such as Monaghan, Dundalk, Nenagh, Ennis, Cork and Kerry.  How is this enhanced care in the community to be delivered under the embargo on recruitment?  From where will these additional frontline health care workers come?Everyone in the State is entitled to free inpatient hospital care but there is no universal entitlement to primary care services such as public health nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and so on.  How is the Minister going to square that circle?  Why is there no provision of psychiatric nursing services on primary care teams?  Mental health nurses working in the community provide a different service in that they deal in the main with cases already diagnosed.  To give an example, currently in the Monaghan area, owing to the non-replacement of nurses on the community mental health teams, there is a reduced ability to conduct assessments.  All health care providers in the community need to be able to refer people about whom they have concerns to a qualified psychiatric nurse who is part of a primary care team.  Will the Minister provide psychiatric nurses as an integral part of primary care teams?  Currently, no such provision is made.  What are the Minister's real plans?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	224	We have, in the past few years, employed an additional 12,000 nurses in the public health system.  Deputies will be aware from the OECD report which examined regulation and public sector services in Ireland that we have the highest ratio in the entire OECD.  In fact ours is double the ratio in France and is substantially higher than the ratio in Northern Ireland and the UK.My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is rolling out A Vision for Change in respect of which I accept there have been some delays.  A number of additional mental health teams, in particular in respect of children and adolescents, will be put in place this year.  There is a robust debate about who should comprise membership of the primary care team.  Pharmacists have made a case for their involvement.  Deputies will be aware pharmacies are a commercial enterprise.  There are many issues arising in regard to the precise make up of the team.  It is important that, within the new primary care centres, the services being provided in a region are provided in one location and that staff treating the same clients or patients do so as part of a team.

How will the Minister square that circle in relation to universal entitlement?  These are not alternatives to existing acute hospital services.

That process is ongoing and I am seeking legal advice in that regard.  Some seven of the recommendations of the report were redacted following legal determination.  I cannot comment on aspects of the report that have been redacted or the basis for the redactions, nor am I in a position to publish the full report.I take this opportunity to restate my assertion that there is much to be learned from the report despite the legal necessity to redact certain aspects.  Recent initiatives aimed at improving services to children and families include the establishment of an emergency place of safety service for children; the putting into place by the HSE of a more integrated multidisciplinary approach to out-of-hours services; the commencement of a comprehensive review of nursing services in the community, which will cover public health nursing services; the preparation of a framework for the delivery of early intervention services, covering both statutory and non-statutory providers to ensure a standard and consistent approach to service delivery; and the establishment by the HSE of a task force to standardise policies and procedures for child protection and welfare services across the country.The Garda Síochána has committed to incorporating the findings of the Monageer report into Garda practices and procedures, which I welcome.

As Deputy Shatter has said, never before have we had recommendations blacked out of a report.  The Minister of State's assertion that it is only the most hard-hitting recommendations that are left in beggars belief.  Does he think the public will buy that?  The public only has his word for that.  That will not do.  At a time when we need to protect our children we need transparency.  That is the first step towards accountability which needs to occur before we get fairness.  We have not had fairness for our children.  This has been the case in the past and it continued until the not distant past.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Has the Minister of State accepted recommendations 8.1 to 8.14 and 8.22 to 8.26?  A simple "Yes" or "No" will do in response.  Will he supply the details of the implementation plan, which has been put in place for each recommendation?  Will he identify who has ministerial responsibility for ensuring each of the recommendations is implemented?  How can we be sure they will be carried out when we do not know what they are?  Will the Minister of State issue them to an Oireachtas committee for its perusal?  That is the only way we can get some transparency.  After 50 years of people being kept in the dark, this is no way to treat this report.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The recommendations will need to be taken on board by the relevant statutory authorities and the Ministers responsible.  Regarding their implementation, I am seeking advice on how I can circulate to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children the substance of the recommendations and also ensure that the committee would be satisfied that those recommendations would have been followed through.  I cannot say what the outcome of that process will be.  It is very serious to have recommendations in this fashion.  I am constrained by legal advice, there is no other constraint.  I have not directed any redaction.  I am doing what I can within the confines of the law, and within the rights of people to their privacy and good name.  I am motivated by trying to improve circumstances in social work services for adults and children, and to publish as much of it as possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I come back to a question I asked the Minister of State previously and he might do us the courtesy of responding to it fully.  Why should the reputation of individuals get priority over the welfare of children?  I have previously drawn this matter to the attention of the Minister of State.  In order to overcome any legal difficulties with regard to privilege, in 1996 the report into the tragic case of Kelly Fitzgerald was referred to an Oireachtas committee, which then published it.  Why can that not be done in this case?  To what extent has that option been considered?  Does the Minister of State seriously want to stand over the reason for not so proceeding that he gave in a recent Irish Independent article?  He said that in the case of the Kelly Fitzgerald report the parents implicated in the report had already pleaded guilty to charges of neglect and the same legal constraint did not apply.  Is the Minister of State telling the House that because the parents in that case were convicted of neglect the report could be referred to an Oireachtas committee for publication but because the parents in this case died the report could not be furnished to an Oireachtas committee?  Is the Minister of State seriously putting that to us?I draw to the attention of the Minister of State that the principal recommendation is the provision of the out-of-hours service that the Minister of State has said he would not implement for financial reasons.  To what extent can we take seriously any pledge he gives of an intention to implement redacted censored recommendations of which no one in this House has any knowledge?

I recall that the morning after the Monageer report was published, Deputy Shatter admonished the Taoiseach on his lack of historical memory of the Kelly Fitzgerald case.  To refresh the Deputy's own memory, the Minister of the time, who was a Fine Gael Member, was heavily criticised for not publishing that report for five months.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I did not intend to suggest that the tragic deaths of the parents of the Dunne family were distinguishable from the Kelly Fitzgerald case.  I was trying to underline that, as Mr. Justice Seán Ryan alludes to in his report, where a conviction has already been achieved there are fewer constraints on the publication of matters causing reputational damage.  The publication of the Kelly Fitzgerald report was facilitated for that reason.  My legal advice is that the publication of the Monageer report in full would result in reputational damage.  I believe the extent of its publication ensures that we have as much information as possible about how this tragedy came about.  We lose sight of that in concentrating on matters which are of importance to Members of this House rather than on what we need to learn from the report in regard to our responsibilities as members of the public and health professionals.

I put it to him that he will build greater public confidence in the Government's good intentions if he finds a way to publish the recommendations rather than apprise the committee of them.  Does he agree that the writers of this report must have intended that the recommendations be studied because they would not have made them otherwise?  There is little point in making recommendations if it is not intended for them to be implemented.  Is there a way for the Minister of State to publish the recommendations in full, if need be after removing personal references, rather than apprising us of the seven blanked out recommendations?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I would like to publish as much of this report as possible because I agree that public confidence could be restored by publication.  The extent to which it remains redacted will be based on legal advice and I will push as far as I can to ensure the maximum amount is published through whatever device is available to me.  I am open to suggestions in this regard from Deputies.

Apart from the crutch of legal advice, he has not explained why he will not do this.  If he rigidly insists on refusing to allow publication of the full report in any form, will he at least publish the uncensored recommendations?  How does he expect the HSE to act on the recommendations contained in the Monageer report if only its CEO is able to read them?The report states that the public health nursing service offered to children under the age of five is critical to the identification of children in need of intervention but that it is unclear whether the systems in place at present are sufficient to this task.  Does the Minister of State agree this is a serious admission and will he immediately undertake a review of this service, as recommended, with a view to its development?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I reiterate that I am seeking legal advice on the extent to which I can apprise the Committee on Health and Children or a sub-committee thereof on the recommendations and whether the committee can prepare a report based on that.In regard to the specific recommendations to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred, gaps certainly exist in our child welfare and protection service.  That is why I have set this as a priority.  We have made significant progress over the past 12 months and for the first time a specific person in the health service will have sole responsibility for the implementation of policy on children and families.  A taskforce which is due to report in the coming weeks will standardise the way referrals and assessments of children at risk are conducted.  The legacy inherited from the health boards has to be overcome, however.  The HSE has announced a review of community nursing and further significant improvements will be made to our child welfare and protection services.  Next Tuesday I intend to put before the House a report for 2007 arising from section 8 of the Child Care Act.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Can the Minister of State tell us the number and identity of the people working in the area of children and social services for the HSE who have access to the full and uncensored report and the seven recommendations?Can he confirm to the House that the terms of reference given to the Monageer inquiry, which was essentially private, are of the same nature as those applied in respect of the Roscommon inquiry into the neglect and abuse of six children over a period of years?  Will the latter report be similar censored and redacted and, if so, will he change the format of that inquiry to ensure its reports and recommendations are fully published?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The latter questions asked by the Deputy are beyond the scope of this question and are a matter for another day.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 94 together.The working group on arthritis and related conditions was established by the HSE in 2006.  The group's report is expected to be completed shortly and will be then considered by the HSE senior management team.  It is intended that the work of the group will inform the future planning and delivery of services for people suffering from arthritis and related conditions.There have been significant developments in this area as a result of the 2005 report of Comhairle na nOspidéal, which recommended the recruitment of a number of additional consultant rheumatologists.  The number of consultant posts overall increased from 16 in 2002 to 25.7 currently, including a post for children and young people at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The recruitment of a second consultant rheumatologist in the north west is underway.  In addition, in the period 2005 to 2008, more than 2,700 people were facilitated with rheumatology appointments by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Arthritis is the greatest cause of disability in Ireland today, affecting one in every six people or 714,000 people, yet the Minister referred to the NTPF facilitating more than 2,500 patients, which puts this issue in perspective.  The World Health Organisation recommends that Ireland should have one rheumatologist per 80,000 people but the reality is we have one per 400,000 people, which means patients must wait up to five years to see a rheumatologist.In May 2006 the Minister established a working group on rheumatology.  It was announced that the group would conduct a review of the provision of services for people with arthritis and publish a report outlining a comprehensive framework for the development of rheumatology services in Ireland.  It was completed in 2008 but the report remains unpublished.  When will it be published?  What plans has the Minister to address this major shortfall in rheumatology services?  How many new posts are planned?  When will they be advertised?  When will they be filled?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I agree there is a major deficit in rheumatology services.  Among the reasons for that is that while we have a large number of doctors, there is an overemphasis on junior doctors with too few consultant posts.  If we could get the ratio right, the amount we are spending would cover the cost of consultant appointments.  As a result of the new consultants' contract, we are in the process of recruiting more consultants across a range of specialist areas, including rheumatology, and this will be financed by shrinking junior doctor posts on a two for one basis.  This has been recommended for many years and it is acceptable to the clinical community and to the HSE.  Since 2005 I have increased the number of rheumatologists from 16 to 25.7 and we are currently recruiting for a post in the north west.The publication of the report is a matter for Professor Drumm and the HSE management team.  I understand among the issues they are considering is the designation of up to ten specialist centres around the country for rheumatology and linking rheumatology and orthopaedics and so on in a number of centres.  Implementation work is delaying the publication of the report.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Will the Minister take cognisance of geographical areas if ten centres are designated?  If she repeats what she did under the cancer strategy and leaves a vast swathe of the country without a service, that would not be acceptable, particularly in regard to rheumatology services, which many people need.We have a lost a great deal of time in the appointment of consultants because of the time it took to renegotiate the consultants' contract.  Will that be taken into account in the context of the number of consultants appointed this year and next year?  If the negotiations had not taken so long, presumably many of the additional consultants would have been in place at this stage.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The Minister stated she will shrink the number of junior hospital doctors and the 2:1 ratio will result in more doctors at consultant level.  The average working week of a consultant is between 33 and 38 hours while the average working week of a junior hospital doctor is almost 100 hours.  If she takes them out of the system, how will she replace the hours?  That does not stack up.It is three years since the working group began its work but its report has not been published.  When will it be published?  She is the Minister and she must take responsibility.  She cannot continually point to the HSE.  How many posts will be filled?  When will they be advertised?  When will they be filled?  Her non-answer that the recruitment process is ongoing is the same as saying Christmas is coming but which year?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I take responsibility for reports I commission but not for those commissioned by others.  Under the Deputy's grand plan, responsibility will be handed over to insurance companies and taken out of ministerial control and, therefore, I will not take a lecture on that.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Deputy referred to the average working time of consultants.  The majority of consultants in the public hospital system work considerably longer hours that he says.  They work way beyond their contractual commitment, which is 37 hours.  The new team approach with a clinical director will ensure hospitals are appropriately covered.  Safe care cannot be delivered through the manner in which we organise doctor services in our hospitals and that is one of the issues driving the reconfiguration.  What has happened in the mid-west with the 12 surgeons in the region working as a team will deliver much safer, better and more care for patients there.A large number of consultants have been recruited in recent years.  We have almost doubled the number of consultants in the system over the past 15 years and we need to go further.  Between 3,000 and 4,000 are probably needed.  I encourage all Members to read the new HealthStat information and perhaps the Joint Committee on Health and Children can examine it.  It highlights a significant variation in activity across, and within, different specialties.  That information could, hopefully, alleviate many of the pressure points relating to access to consultants.  One neurologist in Dublin can see 95 new patients a month while another can see between 12 and 20 a month.  In addition to increasing the number of consultants, it needs to be ensured that activity levels are appropriate when we make these key appointments.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The removal of 24-hour emergency care from Ennis General Hospital has left people living in remote and peripheral areas of County Clare isolated.   We were assured by the Government and the HSE in County Clare that the reconfiguration of accident and emergency services in the mid-west region was being implemented for patient safety reasons and to provide us with a better service.  The people are not convinced and the reality is that many of them are worse off, as acute emergency care at Limerick regional hospital is further away from them.When the issue of advanced paramedics replacing 24-hour emergency care was first mooted I warned that they should not be centrally located and, instead, they should be available 24-7 in each local ambulance station.  With the best will in the world, the advanced paramedics and the ambulance service, who are doing their very best, cannot replace acute hospital treatment within the "Golden Hour".  In the absence of 24-hour emergency care and, bearing in mind the isolated and remote areas where people live, the provision of an air ambulance service in the mid-west region must be fully examined and investigated.  The one trolley, one patient rule causes particular problems, especially if there is a major road accident where two, three or four people who have sustained injuries require hospitalisation.  Recently, there was a road accident near Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, and two people had to wait two hours for an ambulance.  Thankfully, their injuries were not life-threatening.  The ambulance crews did great work but they cannot be in two places at the one time.When the HSE made the decision earlier this year to bypass Ennis General Hospital and transfer all future trauma cases from Clare to Limerick, I highlighted the need for the introduction of an air ambulance service.  Thankfully, a helicopter pad is in operation at the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick.  I had campaigned for this since 2005 because, prior to this, patients had to be transferred by road.  During a recent briefing of Oireachtas Members by Professor Drumm and his team from the HSE, I pressed them on the need to base an advanced paramedic team in Kilrush.  They highlighted the huge expense of training paramedics and claim this expense could not be justified because of the low turnover of patients and it would not be viable.  However, during the briefing, Dr Drumm urged Members to campaign for an air ambulance service to be based at Shannon Airport, which could service isolated areas in Clare and the entire region.  It could be crewed by a medical team from the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick and the HSE told us that it would cost approximately €5 million a year to run.This is not a large amount of money if it saved one life.  The emergency coastal air service is already working exceptionally well in Shannon.  The Air Corps has new helicopters and has the necessary experience.  Similarly, the Garda helicopter is working successfully in its work, also.As an island nation the provision of an air ambulance service is necessary.  The ball is now firmly in the Government's court and the Minister must take the lead.  Negotiations with the HSE must be initiated with the Department of Transport and the Department of Defence with a view to providing an air ambulance service in the mid-west region.  It should not be left to charities to fund this essential service.I welcome the efforts being made by the All-Ireland air ambulance to launch an air service, but it is a charity-funded service and will require over €85,000 per month for it to happen.  It is hoped that future funding will be raised through fund-raising events and donations.  However, Ireland is the only country within the EU that does not have a dedicated air ambulance service.  No such essential service should have to depend solely on fund-raising to survive.  We know how difficult fund-raising is at the moment.It is already well proven that air ambulances save lives and that the mortality rate for patients who are transported to hospital increases the further one is away from a hospital.  Over 44,000 people living in Clare are outside what is termed the "golden hour".  The geography of the area creates huge difficulties, whether a person is in Loop Head, Kilbaha, Carrigaholt, Fanore or Ballyvaughan.  If the Minister is serious about patient care then the highest standard of clinical care should be available to everybody irrespective of where they live.  It is about time that serious consideration is given to the provision of an air ambulance service.  All avenues should be explored to encourage and support the provision of such a service for the people of the mid-west region.  This should be done in conjunction with the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I thank Deputy Breen for raising this Adjournment matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.As the Deputy is aware, the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the HSE mid-west area involves the reorganisation of the regional accident and emergency structure.  As part of this reconfiguration, HSE ambulance services in the mid-west have been significantly enhanced and an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is now in operation.  Protocols are in place to ensure that all trauma, paediatric and obstetric emergency cases will be brought directly to the major tertiary centre at Limerick Regional Hospital.Advanced paramedics are trained to a high standard which equips them to provide more complex pre-hospital care than their colleagues in other ambulance service grades.  Advanced paramedics can administer a wider range of drugs and carry out urgent assessment and treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions prior to arrival at the hospital, including immediate resuscitation as necessary.  These skills constitute an invaluable contribution to maximizing outcomes for patients who become seriously ill or injured.As the Deputy may be aware, an air ambulance service is currently provided by the Air Corps on behalf of the HSE.  The service operates on the basis of a service level agreement prepared by the Department of Defence and the Department of Health and Children, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, all of which are signatories to it.The air ambulance service is provided for the following categories: inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness, neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland, patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK, organ retrieval teams within Ireland, and paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.  In addition, the Irish Coast Guard provides air ambulance inter-hospital transfers as part of its work and also provides for emergency medical evacuation from the islands around Ireland.  In situations where the coast guard service is not available, the Air Corps may transport patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals.The focus of ambulance service policy for the medium term is on the consolidation and development of land ambulance services.  This includes ensuring that ambulance personnel have the requisite skills and training to enable them to provide more complex pre-hospital care.  The continuing development of control and deployment arrangements will also enable the most effective and efficient use of available resources.There are no plans at present for the HSE to become involved in the development or use of private air ambulance services, as any funding that might be diverted to another air ambulance initiative would be at the expense of the ground fleet.  However, the Minister will bear the question of air ambulances in mind as a possible option in the longer term.

I wanted to have an air ambulance service to bring patients in as quickly as possible from around the region.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment concerning the Monageer tragedy in County Wexford.  I want to raise in particular the fact that the psychiatric services were not involved in drawing up of the report. The key to the tragedy was the suicidal ideation and intention of Adrian Dunne and that of his wife.  One can deduce from the report that she was heavily influenced by Mr. Dunne.The report of the inquiry concluded that if the services had intervened with the family on the weekend of their deaths it is unlikely the tragedy would have been averted.  I profoundly disagree with this assumption, however.  Intervention should have taken place and the failure to complete a suicide risk assessment with Adrian Dunne had the most serious of consequences.  The failure of the Government to invest in suicide prevention programmes again highlights its serious neglect in this area, which has tragic consequences for so many victims and their families through the country.The decision of a person to take their life is complex and multifaceted.  It is wrong and dangerous to attribute this terrible decision to one simple factor.  A superficial suicidal risk assessment in relation to Mr. Dunne suggests a high possibility of serious suicide ideation and intention.  The following issues, when combined, would lead one to such a conclusion.  I wish to outline these ten issues as follows.  First, he was a young father who was making detailed plans for his funeral and that of his family.  This alarmed the funeral undertaker who was so concerned that the gardaí were notified. Second, Mr. Dunne was in mourning for his brother who took his life the previous month.  Third, Mr. Dunne was mourning his father who died the previous year.  Fourth, he had recently finalised his will.  Fifth, he and his family were socially isolated.  Sixth, he had intellectual and physical disabilities. Seventh, the family had a high level of engagement with health and social services.  Eighth, he had unmanageable debts.  Ninth, there has been an incidence of suicide-related tragedies in the Wexford area, which introduces a copy-cat dimension.  Finally, another brother of Mr. Dunne's died in a car accident.  He made reference to this in his conversation with the funeral director.  He also spoke of eight different people who had been in accidents.  It is accepted that some deaths on our roads are suicides.This superficial assessment should alert the services that there was a high level of suicide ideation and that the victim was suffering deep psychological, emotional and-or psychiatric trauma.  All the services available to save his life, including the psychiatric services, should have been engaged immediately.  If this had happened, he and his family could have been saved.  The fact that this did not happen, demonstrates again the serious neglect of funding services for people in crisis and allocating resources to develop suicide prevention proposals.The Minister for State says that funding of €15 million to introduce the main recommendation of the report "is an issue at the moment" demonstrates the value placed on the lives of those who are suicidal.  I repeat that the decision to take one's life is highly complex and there is no easy answer.  Those who die by suicide do not intend to take their lives, but know of no other way to remove the deep psychological and sometimes physical pain which they are suffering.  I am concerned that Mr. Dunne's psychiatric condition, including a suicidal tendency and psychological mindset, was not considered deeply by the inquiry into the tragedy.  A psychiatric consultant should have been on the board of the investigation because this issue was such a key one in the tragedy.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I thank Deputy Neville for raising this Adjournment matter and I welcome the opportunity to respond to it.  In April 2007, the Government took the decision to convene an independent inquiry to examine the full circumstances of the tragic case of the Dunne family, whose bodies were discovered at their residence in Monageer, County Wexford.  The three-member inquiry team commenced its work in January 2008.  Under its terms of reference, the inquiry was to deliver a report to the Minster for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by 7 April 2008.  The timeframe of the inquiry was extended on three occasions, and the report was finally submitted to both Ministers on 6 October 2008.In establishing the inquiry, officials from the Office of the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs, OMCYA, were at all times cognisant of the need to provide the inquiry with all necessary assistance while at the same time recognising the need for the inquiry team to maintain its fundamental independence.  Indeed, the independence of the inquiry team was seen as crucial in enabling it to fully carry out its task.  The conduct of the inquiry was a matter for the inquiry team and the Department respected its independence in that regard.A number of communications took place during the setting up phase of the inquiry between the chair and officials from the OMCYA to determine the requirements of the team and to ensure that these requirements were met to the fullest possible extent.  A conscious decision was made at this time to allow the inquiry team to determine and specify its own requirements.  No attempt was made to second guess the team's requirements as this could have been construed as an attempt to direct or otherwise influence the direction or outcome of the report.It was open to the inquiry team, in determining its own programme of work, at any stage of its work to seek access to assistance in any field.  On every occasion when the inquiry team sought such expertise it was made available to them.  The inquiry team had in its membership legal, social work and policing expertise and this was considered entirely appropriate for the work of the inquiry when the three-person team was nominated.  It is worth noting that the final version of the inquiry team's report presented to the Ministers for Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform contained no reference to any perceived lack of availability of expertise in any particular area, including mental health.My office, in all of its dealings with the Monageer inquiry team, worked to support the inquiry through the provision of every possible assistance, while at the same time being cognisant of the team's independence in setting its own agenda in terms of completing its task.  I note that the inquiry team made reference in its report to the increased incidence and need for review of familicide nationally and internationally.  I understand that the HSE in late 2008 established a group headed by Mr. Geoff Day, director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention to examine this area.

This issue has been ongoing for the past 13 years and we are entering the 14th year in which this particular Irish school will be located in totally unsatisfactory prefabs.  I will not rehearse the description of the circumstances but suffice it to say that in the elections of 1997, 2002 and 2007 the school was made promises which were never delivered and a member of the Government in a position of importance has been based in the constituency for all of this time.  Thirteen years down the road, after the school has been shown to be viable, it is based in smelly outdated prefabs in weather like today's, with the toilets backing up and young children in damp smelly conditions.The second full generation of children is going through the school.  As far back as 2000, the Department of Education and Science commented on the prefabs, which had been in existence for only four years at that time.  It stated that the deplorable state of the temporary accommodation made it imperative that the planning process be initiated as soon as possible.  That was nine years ago and the planning process has not been initiated to date.The problem, which has still not been overcome, is the provision of a suitable site.  The Department went to the byways and highways — at least in theory — seeking a suitable site but did not find one.  At present, the option of a suitable site on the site occupied by the prefab temporary school is being explored.  These negotiations are taking place between the Department of Education and Science, the local GAA club — Naomh Fionnbarra — the school itself and Dublin City Council which has the lease on the area.I understand that the proposal up for agreement is the site itself plus a portion of the roadside which has a green area public space.  A technical assessment is being done, which as far as I can gather has been ongoing for the past three or four months with no solution or resolution appearing.  There has been toing and froing with the Department of Education and Science, the local authority, the GAA and the board of management but the log-jam is still there and we do not have a site.  The site has not been acquired and no agreement has been entered into, unless it has happened in the past couple of days.We are facing into another election in 2009 with the school authorities pressing as much as they can to get the public representatives to resolve the matter, particularly the party in power.  Regular meetings are being held, including one tonight.  The Department of Education and Science has been invited to the meeting, as have the local authority and all public representatives.  We hope to have some good news to announce to the weary parents and long-suffering children and staff of the school.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I thank Deputy Costello and the Ceann Comhairle.I will reply to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank Deputy Joe Costello for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on the future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra.Modernising facilities in the existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge and one which the Minister for Education and Science intends will be one of his priorities.  The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.Turning to the specific matter in hand, as the Deputy will be aware the Office of Public Works which acts on behalf of the Department in site acquisitions generally had been requested to source a greenfield site for this gaelscoil.  On foot of advertising, no proposals were received for a greenfield site in the Cabra area.  As a result, the issue of providing a permanent school on the existing temporary site then came into focus.  To pursue this further, meetings have taken place between the Department and Dublin City Council regarding the potential availability of this site and the Department wrote to the council with a proposal suggesting that a lease arrangement be put in place.Officials from the Department have met with the city council and representatives of the GAA club to discuss the issue of entering into a lease arrangement with the city council which in time will require the GAA club to surrender its interest on some of the lands required for a building project.  In February 2009, Department officials met separately with representatives of Naomh Fionnbarra GAA Club to discuss three potential design options available to allow for the provision of an eight classroom school on the site.  The club responded by way of letter in March 2009 indicating its preferred design option based on the options presented by the Department and highlighting their concerns that car parking for their members as well as the teaching staff be addressed.On foot of this, the Department wrote to Dublin City Council advising it of the design option favoured by the GAA club and requested the local authority to consider a technical assessment of the site incorporating the views of the GAA.  This response is awaited.  The further progression of the acquisition of this site and the accompanying building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  I thank the Deputy once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 105 together.Emergency ambulance services in Dublin have been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade for many years on behalf of the Health Service Executive. Ambulance services in the rest of the country are provided by the HSE.The HSE reimburses Dublin City Council for the cost of providing ambulance services, based on a formula covering pay costs, superannuation and certain non-pay elements.  The cost of providing an ambulance centre in Swords is not included in the formula, and the service was put in place by Dublin Fire Brigade without prior agreement as to funding with the HSE.The HSE and Dublin City Council are in discussion regarding a number of practical issues, including the nature and terms on which Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin.  The most appropriate approach to the service in Swords can be considered in this context.More generally, I believe it is important to ensure that all of our pre-hospital emergency services, including the service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade, function as a high quality, integrated health service.  The advice of the Health Information and Quality Authority on pre-hospital care issues will be a significant factor in determining how services should be organised so that clinical governance, patient safety and quality standards are met.The HSE's discussion with Dublin City Council will, in addition to the immediate practical issues relating to Swords, cover how best emergency ambulance services for Dublin can be organised in the future.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 44 and 132 together.The aim of the co-location initiative is to make available additional beds for public patients in public acute hospitals through the transfer of private activity to co-located private hospitals. While the co-location initiative is an efficient means of delivering extra bed capacity, it is a complex process. The funding environment has changed significantly in the last number of months and this has affected both the public and private sectors.  The successful bidders are working on the details of contractual terms with banks and other arrangers of finance. The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.Significant progress has been made in advancing the individual projects.  The Board of the HSE  has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick, St. James's, Waterford Regional and Sligo General Hospitals. Project Agreements for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James's projects have been signed.Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála for the Beaumont project late last year. Planning permission for the Cork and Limerick projects has been granted by the local authorities concerned and appealed in each case to An Bord Pleanála.  A planning application for the St James's project has recently been submitted.The necessary preparatory work for the Project Agreements in respect of Waterford Regional Hospital and Sligo General Hospital is proceeding.Two further projects are at an earlier stage of the procurement process. A tender in respect of Connolly Hospital has been received by the HSE and is under consideration.  Work is being undertaken on the drafting of the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital.The Minister for Finance announced in the Budget on 7 April that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities were being terminated subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development. The relevant provisions are set out in the Finance Bill 2009 which is currently before the House. The termination date is 31 December 2009 but under the transitional arrangements, if certain qualifying criteria are met, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is extended.Provided that co-located private hospitals conform to the requirements of these provisions the tax relief will apply.  The qualifying conditions depend on the type of work to be carried out and whether or not the work requires planning permission. Where planning permission is required, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority. In such cases, the termination date in the case of qualifying hospitals is 31 December 2013.  Under the capital allowances scheme applying to private hospitals, allowances are available to investors only from the year in which services at the relevant hospital have commenced.  No tax expenditure has been incurred so far and none will be incurred until construction is completed and services are opened.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I assume the Deputy is referring to the provision of personal social support services, rather than mainstream health services, to persons with a disability.  These are designed to allow people with a disability to live a life of their choice to the greatest extent possible.  As such, the nature, content and extent of such supports should depend upon the degree to which the individual needs them to participate as fully as possible in the social and economic life of their community.  Currently, these supports are provided by the Health Service Executive and, more commonly, by voluntary agencies funded by the HSE.  They would include, for example, day, respite and residential services.Persons with a disability who require personal social supports, should have choice and control over the supports provided to them.  This is being increasingly addressed through individual funding and individual budgets.  Individual funding can ensure that the funding given to an agency for the provision of services to an individual, must be used to provide services for that individual.  Individual budgets may involve a dedicated budget which is managed by the individual or by advocates on behalf of that individual.This year, the Department of Health and Children will be reviewing disability service expenditure within the health sector as part of the Government's programme of Value for Money and Policy Reviews.  The review will consider models of funding and budgets for those services which are intended to enable people with a disability to participate in the social and economic life of their community.In addition, the Minister for Health and Children has established an Expert Group on Resource Allocation in the Health Sector in April 2009.  The Group will examine how the existing system of resource allocation within the Irish public health service can be improved to support better the aims of the health reform programme.  As part of the terms of reference, the Minister has asked the Expert Group, in the light of its work, to take a view on the most appropriate financing mechanism for the Irish health service.  The Group has been asked to report to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance by April 2010.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas. However, under the Health Service Executive's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.Local Health Offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications. Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours. People whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will continue to have their application considered by the PCRS.Since medical card applications will all be processed centrally, this will result in a more consistent and transparent approach being applied.This is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November. It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Government policy in relation to Palliative Care is contained in the Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (2001).  In 2008 the HSE was asked to prioritise palliative care service developments in the medium term.  As a result "The Palliative Care Services Five Year Development Framework 2009-201” has recently been submitted to my Department by the HSE and is currently under consideration. Patients who are diagnosed with a terminal illness or who are in the last stages of their treatment are initially dealt with by the relevant consultant and/or medical social worker and then referred for appropriate palliative services if required.  To date the HSE has not collected national data on waiting times for hospice services but I am aware of a recent newspaper article which suggested that 133 terminally ill patients are waiting to access hospice care. Patients awaiting admission to an in-patient unit are generally either in an acute hospital where there is specialist palliative care input available, or in the community being attended to by a community based team.  The HSE allocated €78m for Palliative Care services in 2008 and 2,655 people were treated in specialist in-patient units with 7,575 receiving home based specialist care.  A further 729 people received intermediate palliative care and 1,865 received day care services.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Children First — the National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children 1999 are the national over-arching guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies that are dealing with children.  They are intended to support and guide health professionals, teachers, and members of the Garda Síochána and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children.  The key message of the Children First  Guidelines is that responsibility for protecting children must be shared by all adults.  Anyone who works with, has responsibility for, or comes into contact with, children should be aware of the signs of abuse, be alert to the possibility of abuse, and be familiar with the basic procedures to report their concerns.As the Deputy will be aware, in July of last year I launched the National Review of Compliance with Children First.  The key finding of that review conducted by my office is that the Guidelines themselves are fundamentally sound and a renewed focus on implementation is required.In order to ensure consistent national application of the Guidelines the HSE is currently standardising its child welfare and protection business processes.  This is expected to be completed in 2009.  The HSE is also working to achieve a refocusing of social work services through the ongoing Social Work Reform programme.Among the significant successes achieved since the publication of the Children First guidelines has been the work carried out by the HSE Children First Information and Advice Officers in facilitating inter-agency work and supporting voluntary and community agencies to develop child protection policies and practices. Over the past twelve months the HSE has launched several child protection initiatives including the public awareness campaign- Parents Who Listen Protect -with a second phase of this initiative to be rolled out shortly.I am working closely with the HSE in relation to the developments outlined above. I chair regular meetings with senior management of the HSE which enables me to raise specific child welfare and protection issues and to monitor the ongoing developments and progress in this area.  The provision of appropriate robust and responsive child welfare and protection services is a key priority for both myself, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Government.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The incidence of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in the State is unknown. Pre-natal exposure to alcohol can produce a range of effects known as Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).  Depending on factors such as the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy, the stage of pregnancy at exposure and the duration of alcohol exposure, FASD can range from mild attention deficit problems to full Foetal Alcohol Syndrome with its life long problems such as neurological, cognitive and  behavioural problems, growth retardation and developmental delay.  FASD is often difficult to diagnose and can be diagnosed as another disorder with clinically similar features.The promotion of healthy behaviour in relation to alcohol intake is a national priority not least among young woman who are planning or embarking upon pregnancy.In order to create greater awareness in relation to the risks associated with alcohol consumption the Health Service Executive has published a booklet entitled "Women and Alcohol". This booklet includes advice for women to avoid alcohol in pregnancy.  The Department is also devising legislation to provide for mandatory labelling of alcohol containers advising of the risk of consuming alcohol during pregnancy.  The legislation is part of a Public Health (Miscellaneous) Bill being prepared at present.The diagnosis and management of FASD is a clinical issue requiring contact with General Practitioners and Specialists as appropriate.The Health Service Executive is developing proposals for a research project in a large maternity hospital which aims to evaluate the prevalence of alcohol exposure in pregnancy, the patterns of behaviour (social drinking, binge drinking, sustained heavy drinking) and the factors that influence whether or not a woman drinks alcohol before conception and during each trimester of pregnancy. The research project aims to follow a cohort of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy to evaluate the impact on the infant's condition at birth and subsequent development.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 98 together.In April 2007, the National Cancer Screening Service Board (NCSS) established an Expert Advisory Group to study the medical and scientific evidence concerning Screening for Colorectal Cancer and to make recommendations to the Board about the desirability of introducing a population-based screening programme. The Board of the NCSS approved the Second (Final) Report of the Expert Group at its meeting on 20 November and it was submitted to me on 3 December 2008.The Report of the Expert Group could not be comprehensively considered until the completion of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA), carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The Board of HIQA approved the HTA report on 25 March and it was submitted to me on 17 April 2009.Both reports will be published when I have completed detailed consideration of the recommendations, the funding required and the method of putting that in place.Colorectal cancer is the cause of death of approximately 950 people each year in Ireland. This compares to 666 deaths from breast cancer, for example. Because of our ageing population and the long time in people's lives over which risk factors are built up, we can expect an increase in the numbers of colorectal cancer cases in the coming years.  The National Cancer Registry, in its report on Cancer Projections 2005 to 2035, projects that there will be approximately 3,402 cases of colorectal cancer in 2020.As with many cancers, early detection and treatment is one of the most effective measures to avoid premature death. Thorough population-based screening programmes are critically important, with proven effectiveness in breast cancer and cervical cancer, where we now have screening programmes being actively rolled out.For these reasons, colorectal screening is my top priority for the next preventive and early detection services in our National Cancer Control Programme.  I am pleased to note that the Irish Cancer Society shares this priority and at a recent meeting said that it would actively support a colorectal screening programme.I intend that it will have the first call on new resources, which will be found principally by cost-saving measures elsewhere. Other priorities for new developments in cancer prevention and early detection will be capable of being implemented to the extent that sufficient cost-saving measures are found.With the benefit of the report of the Expert Group and the Health Technology Assessment, I am now considering the design and implementation of a colorectal cancer screening programme in the most cost-effective way.

All placements are for a maximum period of one month with the primary objective to return the young people to their homes or local area as quickly as possible.The HSE has stated that all issues in relation to Grove Lodge, and indeed any other children's residential centre, which are brought to the attention of HSE management are dealt with promptly. All criminal matters are referred to the Garda Síochána for investigation and appropriate action.  The Centre in question is staffed by professionally qualified and trained social care staff on a twenty four hour basis and is managed by a Deputy Social Care Manager and Social Care Manager.  The staffing ratio in Grove Lodge is higher than in other mainstream residential centres. The staff team deploy behaviour management techniques in the Centre such as therapeutic crisis intervention which aims to de-escalate situations. In addition the high staff ratio supports the development of positive relationships. The staff team offer all of the young people practical support with the development of life skills, as well as encouraging and facilitating their attendance at education and off-site activities.The HSE has stated that the Centre has security cameras with fencing around the perimeter and an intercom system at the entrance gate to allow access. However, the HSE also state that it is important to bear in mind that the Centre is an open unit as distinct from a detention centre.  Most of the young people are in voluntary care and are free to go in and out of the Centre within the agreed parameters. Due to the fact that it is an open Centre and despite the best efforts of staff to engage them in constructive activities, the young people will sometimes choose to go off with their own friends.  The HSE acknowledges that unfortunately this provides potential for the young people to become involved in anti-social behaviour. If this occurs, this behaviour is challenged by management and staff and leads to sanctions being imposed on the young people. These sanctions may include the withdrawal of privileges, pocket money or participation in activities and may lead to the ultimate sanction of the young person losing their placement depending on the extent and context of their misdemeanours.I am advised that in general the HSE has a close relationship with residents' associations/local groups in the areas where their children's residential centres are located. The HSE has had a number of constructive meetings with representatives from the Donabate/Portrane area with a view to facilitating good communications between the HSE and the local community.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Current policy regarding homeless children is contained in the Youth Homelessness Strategy.  The Strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis.  The goal of the Strategy is "to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he/she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him/her into his/her community as quickly as possible."In 2008, a HSE Working Group completed an examination of progress regarding the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy.  The group concluded that generally the recommendations were implemented throughout the HSE.  The HSE has advised that a range of alternative care options are available in each LHO area to meet the needs of young people who are out of home or who are homeless.  These services include emergency residential beds, short to medium term residential beds, foster care and supported lodgings.The HSE has advised that they are currently undertaking an audit of Aftercare services and that a multi agency group is examining ways to improve services so that young people leaving the care system do not become homeless as adults.  In June 2009 the HSE is introducing a new Emergency Place of Safety Service to be accessed by Gardaí when removing a child to safety under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  This service will allow Gardaí to access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk outside of normal working hours.The HSE has further advised that work is being undertaken arising from the report of the Working Group in 2008 regarding the provision of services for homeless children.  This Report did not recommend the opening of new units for homeless children and the HSE has no plans to do so at this time.

My Department has since provided additional information sought by the Commission.  I expect that the formal decision of the Commission will be notified in early June. If the Commission's decision requires any changes to be made to the scheme I will be proposing appropriate amendments at Committee or Report Stage.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 50, 100 and 101 together.The Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) is being introduced from January 2010 to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children to avail of a free play-school place in their pre-school year, which will be provided for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow eligible children in their pre-school year who are attending full or part-time day-care services to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.Participating children must normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year.  Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  The PPS number of children wishing to avail of the scheme will be provided to my Office for the purpose of verifying the age eligibility of each applicant.  Participating services will receive a capitation payment of €64.50 a week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full or part-time day-care, the service will be required to reduce the childcare fees by the amount of the capitation payment.While the provider will normally be required to provide services on a five day a week basis, transitional arrangements will apply during the initial period of January to August 2010, to allow services to adjust to the requirements of the new scheme.  During this period, services which are already accommodating children on a pro rata basis may continue to do so and the capitation grant will be set by reference to the number of children attending each day rather than the total number of children in a week.Up to 5,000 pre-school services, which will include more that 4,000 commercial childcare providers, will be invited shortly to participate in the new scheme. These services include full and part-time day-care services as well as sessional play-school services. These services must be notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board. Officials in my Office will be writing to these providers very shortly providing them with further details and advising them of the application process.Many of the 5,000 existing private and voluntary pre-school services will have already received capital grant aid under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and or the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  More than 65,000 additional childcare places will have been created by the end of 2010 as a result of this investment.  I am aware from representations received from pre-school services in recent months that many services are currently reporting vacancy rates of up to 25% in their facilities.  I am also aware that a number of people are now considering investing in a childcare business, and also that many existing services, which to date have only been open in the morning, citing lack of demand for an afternoon session, are now considering offering an additional session to meet an increase in local demand.  As I said at the time of the announcement, some instances of under-supply may arise in the initial period of implementation of the scheme, however my Office and the City and County Childcare Committees will monitor the situation carefully, to maximise the beneficial impact of the scheme for parents and children.

On the basis of the legal advice I have already referred to I cannot comment on those aspects of the report that have been redacted or the reasons for the redactions. All the redactions in this report have been done solely on legal advice.I am considering the option of appraising the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children of the substance of the redacted recommendations in a manner and context which ensures the rights of those involved are protected and no reputational damage is suffered. That process is ongoing and I am seeking legal advice in that regard. I want to take this opportunity to re-state my assertion that there is much learning to be gained from the report despite the legal necessity to redact certain aspects.The CEO of the HSE and the Garda Commissioner have received the full report in their capacities as heads of the statutory bodies with responsibilities in relation to matters which were the subject of the inquiry. It is intended that this will enable all the recommendations, including those redacted, to be addressed insofar as they apply to their respective organisations.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 133 together.The most recent medical card and GP visit card figures provided to my Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE) reflect the position on 31st March 2009. The total number of medical card holders on 31st March 2009 was 1,370,764 and the total number of GP visit card holders on that date was 87,277. Accordingly, 32.97% of the national population (4,422,100) have either a medical card (31%) or a GP visit card (1.97%), based on the most recent population estimates available from the Central Statistics Office.In its Service Plan for 2009, the HSE has provided for a net increase of 81,000 medical cards in 2009 i.e. a total of 1,423,830 medical cards by year end. The average monthly increase in the first quarter of 2009 was 6,214 medical cards, which if continued until the end of 2009 would result in a net increase of some 75,000 medical cards. The average monthly increase for GP visit cards in the first quarter of 2009 was 577, which if continued until the end of 2009 would result in a net increase of some 7,000 GP visit cards in 2009. Based on these estimates, the net number of medical card holders would increase by 5.5% and the net number of GP visit card holders would increase by 8.2% in 2009. It should be noted however that these are projections based on the figures for the first three months and the position may change as the year unfolds.My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible. As part of this exercise, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of financial, medical and social need is being undertaken. A Steering Group has been established which is expected to complete this work and report to me within the next few months.  I will then consider the course of action to take as regards income thresholds for medical cards.The current income guidelines that apply to applicants for a medical card in respect of persons aged 70 years and over and persons aged under 70 are set out in the following tables.Gross Weekly Rate€Single — Aged 70 and over700Married Couple — Aged 70 and over1,400Medical Card  Weekly Net RateGP Visit Card Rate€€

The Group comprised officials of HIQA, my Department, the HSE, service providers, organisations representing people with disabilities and service users, and met on a number of occasions during 2008. Following a public consultation process initiated by HIQA, the proposed standards were formulated and have now been published.  These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for people with disabilities in a residential setting and relate only to adult services at present.Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.  However, notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, my Department, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive implementation of the Standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds. Further discussions will take place regarding the introduction of an appropriate level of external validation for relevant settings.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	363	In 2008, the HSE undertook a data and information collection exercise in respect of child welfare and protection social work across its 32 Local Health Office areas.  The purpose of this exercise, the first of its kind, was to provide a better understanding of the activity in each child welfare and protection social work department and, as far as possible, to correlate the various social, economic and environmental factors that have a negative impact on the welfare and protection of children.The output from this work is contained in a comprehensive report titled Social Work and Family Support Survey 2008, which was completed in April 2009.  The report correlates demographic and deprivation data, indicators of children at risk, human resources available to HSE child welfare and protection social work departments, and activity levels in these departments. The preparation of this report will enable improved management of child welfare and protection services by allowing my Office to engage in a more informed dialogue with the HSE so that policy in this area can be improved and services better targeted and delivered. It is, however, also worth noting that as this is the first time this level of data has been compiled it is inevitable that discrepancies will show up in the data. It is only by interrogating these data that my Office and the HSE can improve its quality with a view to integrating these new level of detail into  service and policy evaluation in a truly effective manner.While the report details cases not allocated to a named social worker, it also states that the management of unallocated cases is undertaken by a social work Team Leader and/or Principal Social Worker. For children in care, unallocated cases are managed by a Team Leader and most areas have a system where families can contact the named Team Leader when difficulties arise. In the majority of social work departments, cases without an allocated social worker are also receiving input from other members of the staff in that department e.g. family support worker, child care worker or project worker. No decision has, as yet, been made regarding the publication of the report. All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment by a social worker under the supervision of a social work Team Leader. This process will enable some cases to be dealt with appropriately and closed, some cases to be referred to other services or agencies for appropriate interventions, some cases to be provided with further assessment and intervention and some cases to be prioritised for intervention at a later date on the basis of risk assessment. All cases in which there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child are provided with services.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The use of private ambulance services has traditionally been a component of how public ambulance services are provided, by augmenting the service mainly at patient transport level. This arrangement ensures that the resources of the Health Service Executive can be applied more appropriately to respond to emergency and urgent calls.The HSE has put in place a national contract to replace the arrangements that existed in the regions prior to the establishment of the HSE.  The contract is in line with the requirements of the EU procurement Directives.  The use of private ambulance services constitutes a very small part of the total workload of the HSE ambulance service.  The HSE, in sourcing private ambulance providers, requires compliance with the clinical and technical standards set by the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council, the statutory body having responsibility for registration, education and training and standards within the field of pre-hospital emergency care — public, private and voluntary.  There is no licensing system for private ambulance services under the Health Acts.

An additional 18 beds will be provided for the Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service in 2009, bringing the total capacity to 30 beds.  Ten of these beds have already opened, four in St Anne's, Galway and six in St Vincent's, Fairview.  A further eight beds will be opened shortly in St Stephen's, Cork.Construction has now commenced on two 20 bed units in Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway.  It is anticipated that construction will be completed on both developments in late 2009 and the beds commissioned in 2010.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	367	Last year, hospital Emergency Departments treated 1.15 million people, of which 368,000 were admitted to hospital. In 2005 the average number of patients on trolleys awaiting admission each day was 259. The average to date in 2009 is down to 141, and figures to date in May show a further reduction to 116. Data collected by the HSE over recent months indicate that the vast majority of those patients requiring admission are transferred to the ward areas without any undue delay.We need to continue to reduce waiting times for all patients presenting as emergencies to our hospitals.  With this in mind, the HSE has set a lower waiting time target of 6 hours for all patients in its 2009 Service Plan. The aim is that all patients, irrespective of whether they are admitted or not, will be assessed, treated and discharged or admitted within 6 hours of arrival.  The HSE is working to measure and report on the time taken to manage each patient's care from the point of arrival in the Emergency Department until they are discharged or admitted.  As an interim measure, a sampling approach is being adopted at a selected time period each day, which involves collecting registration, admission and discharge data from Emergency Departments at all hospitals, either electronically or manually.Preliminary results from the HSE's Performance Monitoring Reports for March 2009 for a sample of 19 hospitals indicate that of all patients who did not require admission, 92% were seen and discharged within 6 hours. Approximately one third of patients who attend Emergency Departments are admitted to hospital. At the moment, almost half of these are admitted to the ward within the new maximum target time of 6 hours. The challenge for hospitals is to ensure that this new target is reached for all patients.I am confident that the introduction of the Fair Deal in September this year will have a positive impact on the number of patients in hospital whose discharge has been delayed. As a result of the introduction of the new scheme, nursing home care will be more affordable and acute beds will be freed up for acute patients.  There have been very significant improvements and we will continue to work on further improvements by reducing inappropriate admissions, reducing average length of stay and shifting activity from in-patient to day case procedures.  The delivery of these measures will be essential in further improving the experience for patients attending Emergency Departments.  While it has been necessary to achieve savings across the acute hospital system, the HSE and individual hospitals will work to ensure that front-line services, including Accident and Emergency services, are protected.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 52 together.Seasonal bed closures are a normal feature of the hospital system, as a means of maximising efficiency when demand is lower — for example, during holiday periods — and to facilitate periodic refurbishment or decorating work.  Beds may also be closed from time to time in order to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allotted budget for the year.  Notwithstanding any bed closures which may occur, the HSE is committed to achieving the volume and quality of throughput in hospitals provided for in its 2009 National Service Plan, which I approved in December 2008.  The National Service Plan commits to an increase in the proportion of patients treated on a day basis and this is one of a number of measures which will enable more efficient use to be made of the available bed stock.The HSE has not yet determined the exact arrangements for bed closures during the months of July and August.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Home Help Service is a well established and successful component of the overall strategy to enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Significant additional funding has been provided to the Health Service Executive in recent years for the expansion of this service. The HSE Service Plan 2009 envisages that the level of service provided nationally in 2008 will be maintained this year, thus equating to:funding of around €211m to support this particular servicea projected overall provision of 11.98 million Home Help hours.around 54,500 persons expected to be in receipt of home help service nationally at any one time.It is the responsibility of the HSE to operate the Home Help service at local level, in the context of the service nationally, and taking account of overall priorities and resources. This particular service, in addition to the range of other home care support initiatives undertaken by the Executive such as Home Care Packages, can play an important role in relieving pressures on the acute hospitals and long-term residential systems.  The Executive regularly reviews the provision of Home-Help in individual cases, having reference to various factors such as changing needs of the person and ensuring that resources are allocated as fairly as possible between existing clients and new applicants.  In the circumstances, the question relating to the specific issues raised by the Deputy has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Government and the HSE remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk. Since taking up office as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have convened and chair regular meetings between officials from my Office and senior child welfare and protection managers in the HSE aimed at improving the provision of services to children at risk.  A key component of these discussions has been the provision of out of hours care.In this context, the HSE is now putting in place a standardised national system whereby Gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This service will conform with Child Care Regulations and with the National Foster Care Standards. The provision of this service aims to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting. Foster families are currently being recruited with a view to commencing the service in June 2009.In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated multidisciplinary approach which builds on the HSE's existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  This should provide a more effective and integrated service by using existing resources and strengthening the links between services such as mental health and social work to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours. The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) has not funded youth cafés. The OMCYA has been allocated €750,000 from Dormant Accounts for the development of a structured programme of youth cafes in 2009.  Final decisions on the operation of this programme are still under consideration.  The focus of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) which is now under the remit of the OMCYA is not on the provision of youth cafés.  However a number of the facilities built under the YPFSF include a youth café area incorporated within the facility.  The objective of the Fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.The Youth Affairs Section that transferred from the Department of Education & Science to the OMCYA as of 1 January, 2009 has also provided funding in recent years to a small number of youth work projects that provide youth cafe facilities for young people.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Food labelling is governed by Council Directive 2000/13/EC which was transposed into Irish law in 2002.  The principle underlying this Directive is that the purchaser must not be misled to a material degree, particularly with reference to the nature, composition and origin of the foodstuff. In addition, there are national regulations for beef and veal, making mandatory the display of the country of origin on the label.In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation. The draft EU Commission proposal makes allowance for voluntary Country of Origin Labelling for food products. The Commission has proposed that "where the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food is not the same as the one of its primary ingredient(s), the country of origin or place of provenance of those ingredient(s) shall also be given".  Furthermore, it proposes that "for meat, other than beef and veal, the indication on the country of origin or place of provenance may be given as a single place only where animals have been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.  In other cases information on each of the different places of birth, rearing and slaughter shall be given".  The proposal is still under discussion at EU working group level.In November 2008, Ireland submitted its position paper on the proposal which supports mandatory Country of Origin Labelling. This paper was informed by submissions made to the FSAI by many of the key stakeholders. Ireland's position will be further informed by the outcome of an FSAI Consumer Survey, to be completed in June 2009.Since January 2008 a number of meetings have taken place at European Union Working Group level, attended by officials from Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The next meeting is due to take place on 28 May 2009. On 16th March 2009, the European Parliament examined the proposal. Parliament has indicated, however, that it will not be in a position to conduct the first reading of the document until after the  European Parliament elections.  At this stage, it is likely that the proposal will not be finalised until end of 2009 at the earliest.  Meanwhile, Ireland will continue to build alliances among member states, in addition to Italy, who to date have strongly advocated country of origin labelling.

In line with the new contractual arrangements agreed with Medical Consultants and to provide for a consultant delivered service, the number of hospital consultants will be increased but there will need to be compensatory savings by suppressing Non-Consultant Hospital Doctor posts.  My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on the specific issues she has raised.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The Government and the HSE remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk. Since taking up office as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have convened and chair regular meetings between officials from my Office and senior child welfare and protection managers in the HSE aimed at improving the provision of services to children at risk.  A key component of these discussions has been the provision of out of hours care.In this context, the HSE is now putting in place a standardised national system whereby Gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This service will conform with Child Care Regulations and with the National Foster Care Standards. The provision of this service aims to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting. Foster families are currently being recruited with a view to commencing the service in June 2009.In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated multidisciplinary approach which builds on the HSE's existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  This should provide a more effective and integrated service by using existing resources and strengthening the links between services such as mental health and social work to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours. The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 47 together.I have emphasised to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) the need for maximum cost-effectiveness in the discharge of its remit, consistent with providing safe and effective care, and I am satisfied that the Fund is aware of its responsibilities in this regard.  I have also asked the NTPF, in its dealings with private hospitals, to seek even better value in the current year and the Fund indicates that it has already succeeded in negotiating reductions in the prices paid for certain high-volume procedures.   The Fund has also stated that where acceptable prices cannot be agreed, it will not purchase the required service from the provider concerned.The NTPF uses a number of benchmarks in determining whether the prices offered by private providers represent value for money.  These include public hospital average casemix costs and, where known, the prices paid by private health insurers.  The NTPF has undertaken a comparison of the average price it has paid for certain high-volume procedures with the public hospital average casemix cost for similar treatments.  While it is not appropriate to draw a direct comparison between the price charged by a private hospital for a procedure and the average public hospital casemix cost, the NTPF indicates that for the treatments in question there is a reasonable correlation in average costs. In some cases the price paid by the NTPF was appreciably lower than the average casemix cost in the public hospital system.The Comptroller and Auditor General operates independently of the Government and I have no function in relation to any examination which the C & AG may decide to undertake.

Recommendations include the establishment of a Steering Group to oversee its implementation and to ensure coherence with the development of other relevant services.The Steering Group has been established and will oversee the roll out of the screening programme. The HSE has set aside the necessary finances to allow for the commencement of the Programme later this year, subject to the preparatory arrangements being completed.  My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputies on the operational issue raised by them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	379	While the co-location initiative is a complex process, it is an efficient means of delivering extra bed capacity for the public hospital system. Significant progress has been made in advancing the individual projects involved. The Board of the HSE  has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University, the Mid-Western Regional Limerick, St. James's, Waterford Regional and Sligo General Hospitals. Project Agreements for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James's projects have been signed.I assume that the Deputy's questions regarding expenditure refer to the spending incurred by the HSE on its legal and other expenses in respect of the co-location initiative. Each of the preferred bidders under the co-location initiative is required to pay a deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement and this is non refundable  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.The Deputy's question also refers to patient safety issues in the private sector. The fundamental objective of Government health policy is to maximise the health status of the population.  The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.   Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.The private healthcare sector plays a significant role in the provision of health and personal social services in Ireland. Such private healthcare provision spans from general practitioner services through private beds in public hospitals and private hospitals to private nursing homes.  In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund purchases treatment primarily from private hospitals and has been very successful in reducing the length of time public patients have to wait for hospital treatment.In January 2007, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and it reported to me in July 2008. The Government recently accepted the Commission's report and approved the commencement of work on the drawing up of legislation to give effect to its central recommendation on the licensing of both public and private healthcare providers.  Co-located hospitals would be subject to licensing and any other standards that are introduced.  Other recommendations to be implemented include the introduction of a programme of clinical audit across all health services, adverse event reporting, learning dissemination and a system of credentialing for healthcare professionals right across the public healthcare system.

The Report was published by the Mental Health Commission on Thursday, 14th May 2009.I welcome the publication of the Report, the purpose of which is not just about detecting abuses and unsafe practices but also to provide constructive feedback to those delivering services and act as an educational resource to encourage the development of progressive and innovative ideas and practices.  The Report highlights the fact that reforming our mental health services is not just about increased financial investment; it is about staff being receptive to change.  Essentially it involves putting the service user at the centre and embedding the ‘recovery' approach in the service.  With regard to the Inspector's view that the absence of a separate Mental Health Directorate is a serious drawback to the implementation of ‘ A Vision for Change’, I welcome the recent decision  by the HSE to appoint a national lead dedicated to mental health.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Refurbishment work took place last year in St Vincent's University Hospital to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.  The next stage in the development of St. Vincent's Hospital will involve the building of a new ward block to replace existing accommodation.  The new ward block will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients. I am anxious to ensure that the project is delivered without delay.  The HSE, in partnership with St. Vincent's Hospital, have structured the tender for this development in such a way that payments for the works can be deferred towards the end of the construction period.  The design team have been instructed to proceed on this basis.  They have now signed off on the design and will shortly be going to tender for the construction of the new building.   It is intended that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will be completed as early as possible in 2011.

This agreement did not initially cover colonscopies, but this was subsequently agreed at my request. The HSE is now working to give effect to this agreement in relation to colonoscopies.I have instructed the HSE to ensure that urgent colonoscopies are provided within four weeks. The HSE has established a special review group to identify and report on the number of patients who require urgent colonoscopies.  The review group has begun work on establishing a process that will enable the information on urgent colonoscopies to be accurately recorded and reported.  A system whereby any patient who requires an urgent colonoscopy will receive it within four weeks of referral is to be in place by the end of the year.It is important to note that not all colonoscopies are urgent. All hospitals prioritise individuals with significant symptoms according to clinical need. Only a small proportion of patients are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.  In an average year, for example, there are some 2,000 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed in Ireland, while there are over 55,000 colonoscopies performed.In the case of non-urgent colonoscopies, the HSE has instructed all hospitals to refer patients waiting for longer than three months to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The National Hospitals Office is actively encouraging all hospitals to continue to work with the NTPF to monitor waiting times and to refer those waiting over 3 months to the NTPF.  The HSE's special review group will also examine the nature of the conditions for which patients are placed on the single waiting list for a colonoscopy.  These include symptomatic patients, those recalled periodically and those for surveillance.  The group will identify the specific actions required by the HSE to provide patients with a colonoscopy as soon as possible.Finally, the HSE has also begun work on developing and implementing national guidelines for quality assurance of colonoscopy services.  The HSE intends to make best use of the considerable existing knowledge and expertise as to how the management and quality of colonoscopy services can be optimised. To this end it has had preliminary engagement with some of the professional medical colleges.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I do not believe that there will, in fact, be a loss of €50m to public hospitals arising from the new consultants' contract, and I will set out the reasons why.  A central objective of the new consultants' contract is to improve access for public patients to public hospital services.  It ensures, for example, for the first time in public hospitals, that patients needing outpatient or ambulatory diagnostic care will be seen on the basis of medical need, with no distinction between public and private.  Consultants holding the ‘public-only' Type A contract do not undertake any private work and no patient admitted under the care of such a consultant can be accorded ‘private' status.Public hospitals may not therefore raise a private accommodation charge where a patient is admitted under the care of a Type A Consultant, nor may another consultant involved in the treatment of such a patient charge a fee.  Approximately 560 of 1,550 consultants who have accepted the new contract have this Type A contract.  Public hospitals earn income from health insurance companies for private patients admitted only to designated private beds.The only way that the HSE could be at a loss of €50m, as a result of the new consultants' contract, would be if designated private beds in public hospitals went unoccupied by private patients for a significant part of the year.  I do not expect this to happen, because there will be approximately 1,400 consultants still in a position to treat private patients in public hospitals.  It can be expected that the 980 consultants on the new contract who are allowed private practice, plus the 400 approximately remaining on the old contract, will continue to admit and treat sufficient numbers of patients, so that there will be little, if any, loss of private bed income to the hospitals concerned.  Thus, in practical terms, I do not expect a €50m loss, or any material loss at all, to public hospitals as a result of the new contract.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The estimated additional cost of the implementation of ’A Vision for Change’ the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy is €150m over 7 — 10 years. Substantial resources are invested in mental health services; overall spending on these services amounts to an estimated €1 billion.  Development funding totalling €51.2m was allocated to the HSE in 2006 and 2007, some of which was diverted because of core budgetary pressures; however, I am advised by the HSE that 94% of the €51.2m will be in place before the end of 2009.  Implementing ‘A Vision for Change’ is essentially about the reallocation and remodelling of these resources.  Additional funding has been provided in 2009 for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service.  In addition, once-off funding of €1.75m has been provided for suicide prevention initiatives and for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	386	In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.I wish to advise that as part of the Employment Control Framework for the health sector, the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE meets regularly to monitor the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.

A series of focused and necessary service changes are being implemented across the region.The transfer of acute medical care from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan is subject to a number of dependencies first being in place, including the development of an enhanced ambulance and pre-hospital thrombolysis service.  The recently opened Medical Assessment Unit at Cavan will also support the transfer of services from Monaghan.  The timeframe for this transfer is currently under review by the HSE.  The changes proposed by the HSE, which I support, are for reasons of patient safety.  The HSE will continue to work with all stakeholders to bring about the improvements in a carefully planned way that puts patients first.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 72, 123 and 135 together.The provision of high quality hospital services for children will continue to be a priority for the Government.  The Children's Health First Report commissioned by the Health Service Executive indicated that the population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital.  It recommended that the hospital should be in Dublin and should, ideally, be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Following detailed consideration, it was decided that the most appropriate location for the new National Paediatric Hospital is at the Mater Hospital. The hospital will also include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght  which is to open in  advance of the main hospital.The Government is committed to the development of the National Paediatric Hospital as a priority.  The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which was established in May, 2007.   The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion in 2014.  Services will continue to be supported and developed at Our Lady's Children's Hospital until such time as the new National Paediatric Hospital is opened.In common with all hospitals, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin is facing considerable challenges in delivering a high quality service to its patients, while remaining within budget.  The Hospital is committed to providing the full level of services that it promised in its service plan for 2009.  The top priority will be to protect patient care.  So far this year, Crumlin Hospital has delivered more treatments to patients than for the same period last year. In the first three months of 2009 there were 2,745 treatments for children as in-patients and 3,841 as day cases– up by 244 over 2008. Crumlin also had 21,252 attendances at the out-patient department — up by 1,041 from the first quarter of last year.The allocation to Crumlin for 2009 is €139.6m, an increase of some 39% over the last five years. There was a reduction of 3% this year, in line with the budgetary constraints we face across the system.  A particular challenge for the Hospital is that it is operating at some 100 posts above its employment ceiling — it employed 1,650 people (wholetime equivalents) at the end of March compared with its ceiling of 1,550.  This is contributing to its current financial difficulties.The HSE is working closely with Crumlin Hospital to achieve an agreed programme of savings, totalling €6.5m this year.  The focus of these savings will be on non-pay areas of expenditure and on protecting front-line services.  On this basis, the HSE believes that the Hospital will achieve a break-even position this year.I believe that we need to look now in a more strategic way at the way in which we provide paediatric services in Dublin.  In 2009 the Government will provide over €250m for the running of three paediatric hospitals in Dublin — Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght. I believe that we can achieve significant cost savings if services and practices are more closely integrated across the three hospital sites, even before the new National Paediatric Hospital has been completed.  With this in mind, the HSE is pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The HSE National Service Plan 2009 approved by me in December 2008 included €250m in economy and cost avoidance measures for 2009 (in addition to a continuation of €280m value for money measures from 2008).  In broad terms, the planned level of activity outlined in the HSE Service Plan  for 2009 is in line with that targeted in 2008.  Since then, a number of potential exposures (some of which were identified in the National Service Plan) materialised. Based on the best information available, a figure of €540m was arrived at through detailed examination undertaken by the HSE and my Department.The HSE submitted an amendment to the National Service Plan on 2 April under Section 32(4) of the Health Act 2004 with proposals to achieve savings of €72m through service reductions. As part of the Supplementary Budget on 7 April, additional funding of €160m was made available to offset the projected reduction in the yield from the health levy. It was also agreed that, in acknowledgement of the difficulty in accurately forecasting the impact of unemployment levels on medical card numbers, the funding provision in respect of medical cards would be kept under review.  The approach agreed as part of the Supplementary Budget when combined with €133m in measures already identified by the HSE and not affecting the Service Plan, left a residual problem of €147m (compared to the previous figure identified of €540m).As outlined in my press release of 24 April, I wrote to the Chairman of the HSE on 23 April outlining a series of measures totalling €147 aimed at avoiding service level reductions and which obviate the need for the proposed amendment to the existing National Service plan.  This approach means that the post National Service Plan pressures of €540m have been addressed without recourse to service reductions.  I have asked the HSE to continue to focus on delivering the level of services as originally planned. Notwithstanding the progress made, it is clear that the financial challenges underpinning the HSE's delivery of the Service Plan continue to be very substantial.  The achievement of the service targets set out in the HSE Service Plan will require continued monitoring and the emphasis on budgetary management will need to be sustained at all levels.

It is important to note that, as announced in Budget 2009, there will be a 3% reduction in management and administrative grades in sections of the health sector in 2009. This equates to 500 wholetime equivalents and the reduction will streamline management structures in the health service and will further reduce health employment in 2009.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not possible, the health service supports access as appropriate to quality long-term residential care.  Additional funding of just over €200 million was provided to develop various community services and supports for older people over the period 2006-8. This additional funding related, for example, to Home Care Packages, Home-Help, Meals-on-Wheels, and Day/Respite care.Home Care Packages are a relatively new initiative, introduced in 2006, and developed in the meantime across the country through phased investment of €120 million. A package comprises a number of community-based services and supports, provided in a way to best meet the needs of an older person. The person will have significant medical, nursing and/or therapy requirements and may be recently discharged from hospital, or at-risk of admission to hospital, if such needs are not met in a planned way.  The HSE Service Plan 2009 envisages around 8,700 people benefitting from packages at any one time, or over 11,000 people benefitting over the course of the year. It is a matter for the HSE to provide Home Care Packages at local level, including as appropriate, delivery on a partnership basis with the voluntary sector or through private providers.It is clear that the Government has made considerable improvements in recent years to enhance Home Care provision generally across the country. There is no doubt that demand can at times exceed resources. However, the HSE has responsibility to deliver services both nationally and locally, in the context of Government priorities and its overall resources, while at the same time taking account of the need to maximise services to the most vulnerable in our society. The HSE undertakes reviews of its wide range of services, to ensure that such services are provided in the best possible manner.  In the circumstances, the question relating to the particular case has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Requests for compensation arising from medical accidents or clinical error are dealt with by the Accident Compensation Corporation as one element of a general no fault system covering all accidents including motor, industrial/occupational and domestic accidents.The focus of the scheme is on rectifying any damage caused by an accident and returning the affected person to full health and to work if appropriate. Compensation is made up of health and rehabilitation services and a weekly cash payment to compensate for any loss of earnings. Because of the level of support provided under the scheme the right to sue for personal injury arising from an accident has been abolished in New Zealand except in exceptional cases where there is a claim for exemplary damages. Therefore, in general, victims of accidents receive no compensation for "pain and suffering". The New Zealand scheme is funded from a combination of taxation and an employment levy.In regard to a possible introduction of such a scheme into the health services in this country, a Group, chaired by Professor Peter McKenna of the Rotunda Hospital and which will be reporting to me later this year, has been examining the feasibility of introducing a limited no fault scheme for infants who suffer from Cerebral Palsy. I will await their report before giving further consideration to a wider no fault compensation scheme for the health services.  As I have said before, I would be sympathetic to the introduction of a no fault compensation scheme with clearly defined parameters with regard to costs and types of claims.

This arrangement has operated successfully for a number of years.The air ambulance service is provided by the Air Corps for the following categories:- Inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness, Neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland, Patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK, Organ retrieval teams within Ireland, and Paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.  In addition, the Irish Coast Guard provides Air Ambulance inter-hospital transfers as part of its work and also provides for emergency medical evacuation from the islands around Ireland.  In situations where the Coast Guard service is not available, the Air Corps will transport patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals.The focus of ambulance service policy for the medium-term is on the consolidation and development of land ambulance services. This includes ensuring that ambulance personnel have the requisite skills and training to enable them to provide more complex pre-hospital care.  The continuing development of control and deployment arrangements will also enable the most effective and efficient use of available resources.  There are no plans at present for the HSE to become involved in the development or use of private air ambulance services.

This means that the possession and sale of BZP are now illegal. A press release issued from my Department on 31 March and there was considerable media coverage of the ban on BZP.  Head shops possessing supplies of BZP must dispose of those stocks or risk prosecution under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Enforcement of this measure is a matter for the Gardaí who have powers under the Misuse of Drugs Acts to search premises and to seize supplies of BZP which have not been disposed of.

The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which was established in May, 2007.  The Board has appointed a Chief Officer, a Medical Director and a Finance Officer.  The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion in 2014.  The new hospital will be based at the Mater Hospital and will  include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght which is to open in advance of the main hospital.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 134 and 138 together.The fundamental objective of Government health policy continues to be to maximise the health status of the population.  The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ensuring patient safety is paramount so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.It is widely recognised that treating a low volume of cases in higher-volume specialties is not conducive to optimal patient care.  In order to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, clinicians must be able to maintain their specialist skills by treating a sufficient number of cases.  It is more difficult for specialists to maintain their skills in smaller hospitals when treating a low volume of patients.  This has implications for how we organise acute services generally.The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised in particular regions. These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services in the regions concerned, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, acute surgery and medicine. Importantly, the programme also involves developing smaller hospitals to provide a much greater proportion of less complex care, especially in day surgery, medicine and diagnostics. This underlines the fact that smaller hospitals can be reconfigured to provide important services for their local community.A recent example of reconfiguration in relation to the delivery of specialist services is the development of designated centres for cancer care.  A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland 2006 identified an evidence-based requirement for specialist cancer centres each serving a population of 500,000 — meaning that eight would be required — and recommended, inter alia, that all cancer care should be provided through a system of four Managed Cancer Control Networks. The restructured National Cancer Control Programme will deliver real improvements in cancer care based on best international practice.In 2007, I established the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) as part of the Health Reform Programme. A core function of HIQA is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  HIQA has already developed national quality standards in areas such as Symptomatic Breast Disease Standards, National Hygiene Standards and National Standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  Work has also commenced on the development of National Quality Standards for acute hospitals in the public sector.  HIQA standards will apply to all public health services wherever appropriate.There has also been considerable progress made in recent years in reforming the regulation of health professionals in Ireland.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007 provide for new, modern systems of regulation for Medical Practitioners and Pharmacists.  New legislation is in preparation for the reform of the regulation of Nurses and Midwives. Part 11 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, once commenced, will place duties and responsibilities on individual medical practitioners, their employers and the Medical Council regarding the maintenance of professional competence.  Preparations are ongoing for the implementation of these provisions, which will be commenced in due course.In January 2007, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and it reported to me in July 2008.  The Government recently accepted the Commission's report and approved the commencement of work on the drawing up of legislation to give effect to its central recommendation on the licensing of both public and private healthcare providers. Other recommendations to be implemented include the introduction of a programme of clinical audit across all health services, adverse event reporting, learning dissemination and a system of credentialing for healthcare professionals.   Both the Government and the HSE are committed to a process of change which is incremental and which involves appropriate consultation and discussion with those affected.I believe that all of these measures are contributing to an improvement in the quality and standard of our health service.

The Group will examine how the existing system of resource allocation within the Irish public health service can be improved to support better the aims of the health reform programme.  As part of the terms of reference, I have asked the Expert Group, in the light of its work, to take a view on the most appropriate financing mechanism for the Irish health service.  The Group has been asked to report to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance by April 2010.

Donors are referred from their consultant for initial screening for suitability for blood donation. The donors are reviewed once per year by the referring consultant, but are otherwise cared for by the IBTS clinical staff.  The service was initially set up as a pilot in 2007, but has become an established service following the success of the pilot scheme. The clinic has the capacity at the present time to provide a service for up to 600 blood donors with haemochromatosis. Blood collected at this clinic is treated in the same way as all other blood collected by the IBTS. The IBTS does not offer the service to people who would otherwise have to pay for phlebotomy, on the basis that it could be seen as offering a degree of financial incentive to donate blood. This would be contrary to good practice and to the requirements of European law on promoting unremunerated donations.The IBTS is considering the options and opportunities for an expansion of its service for haemochromatosis patients throughout the country, and is exploring this position with stakeholders at present.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Some 522.41 wholetime equivalents were employed in my Department at the 30th April 2009 of  which 467.06 work in the core Department.An Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement for civil and public servants was introduced by the Department of Finance on 30th April 2009.  The details of the scheme are outlined in Department of Finance Circular 12/2009 — Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement and this Circular is available on the Department of Finance website at www.finance.gov.ie.   The purpose of the scheme is to facilitate the permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the civil service, local authorities, health sector and non-commercial state bodies, with associated restructuring of organisation and operations in as timely a manner as possible.  The scheme is open to applications from 1st May 2009 until 1 September 2009.  In accordance with the terms of the Government moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service, vacancies arising from the operation of the scheme may not be filled unless specific sanction is given by the Department of Finance.  The implementation of the scheme in my Department will need to be managed carefully and a plan to cope with the reduction in numbers will be developed.  This will include a review of work activities and processes and consequent changes in the organisation of work and staffing resources.Further details are awaited from the Department of Finance in relation to plans for the redeployment of staff in the civil and public service.  A number of staff have applied to be considered for redeployment on a voluntary basis to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and my Department is also in contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to possible redeployment to that Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.Unemployment is increasing across the country due to the downturn in the economy and this has impacted on the Tallaght area also.  This situation is unwelcome and I share the Deputy's concern in the matter.  The increases are, however, an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.   This current economic uncertainty and consequent rise in unemployment requires a national response as the current challenges we are facing are not confined to one specific region.Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the CSO. It does not provide data on particular counties but only on Regions.  Employment in the Dublin Region, which includes Tallaght, has dropped by 19,800 and unemployment has increased by 15,000 in the year to Quarter 4 (September — November 2008), the latest period for which data is available.  The number of persons signing on to the live register in the Tallaght region as at end April, 2009 stands at 8,787, an increase of 97% over the last twelve months.  The Live Register, however, is not a measure of unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who might be signing on from time to time.In response to the challenge of increasing unemployment my Department through FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, is prioritising on a national basis, the need to assist and up-skill those who have become unemployed as a result of the present downturn in the economy.  In addition to the 51,000 FÁS training places announced on the 5th February, 2009 a further 18,725 training places for the unemployed were provided in the Supplementary Budget to bring the total number of training and work experience activation places funded by my Department in 2009 to approximately 128,000. This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland's (EI) activity in Tallaght is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up companies.  The agency works closely with the Tallaght Institute of Technology in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has approved financial support of over €2.6m to the Institute for the development and management of a Campus based Incubation Centre. This centre provides entrepreneurs with affordable space in an environment, which provides support to them to research their new ideas, and to afford them the opportunity to bring about new indigenous businesses. The agency has also approved support of €1.225m for a Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Technology Tallaght, the focus of which is Microsensors for Clinical Analysis.South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) continues to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout South Dublin, which is inclusive of the Tallaght area. Business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in the activities of the CEB.  The CEB delivers a series of programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  During 2009 South Dublin CEB will continue to support enterprise development in the area through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.The Government remains intent on meeting the on-going challenges in the labour market, including the on-going needs of the unemployed in the Tallaght region.  We will, through FÁS, continue to focus on providing training opportunities to those who are unemployed to improve their skills, increase their employability, thereby enabling them to get back into employment as soon as possible.

These applications will be examined by the Redundancy Payments Section to see if they meet the eligibility criteria set down in the Redundancy Payment Acts.Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not there is in fact a redundancy situation.  Disputes in this regard can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.Considerable information is available on my Department's website (www.entemp.ie) in relation to redundancies, including an on-line redundancy payments calculator. Further information is obtained by telephoning 1890 80 80 90
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Based on a review of payments made over the period 27th to 30th April, the average time taken for payments to be issued by my Department to outside businesses in respect of goods and services received was 11 days where a valid invoice was received and all necessary tax requirements were in order.  The processing of payments by my Department's agencies is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies concerned and I do not have details of the average time taken by them to make payments.The Government has, this week, approved formal arrangements to reduce the period within which payments are made by Government Departments to their business suppliers.  At present, the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 provide for late payment interest to be paid to suppliers where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date.  In the absence of any agreed payment date, late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed from the date of receipt of a valid invoice.  The Government's objective is to reduce the payment period for Government Departments to 15 days with effect from 15th June 2009.These arrangements should help ease cash flow difficulties for small business in the current economic climate.  The arrangements will operate on an administrative basis and will not alter the contractual relationship between Departments and their suppliers or the period from which late payment interest applies.  I am assessing the impact of extending the arrangements to the local authority, health and education sectors and specific proposals in relation to these sectors will be developed following the completion of the assessments.

However, irrespective of the number of sources of income against which the PAYE tax credit may be due, an individual is entitled to only one PAYE tax credit (currently €1,830) per annum.As regards a pensioner couple where each spouse is in receipt of a separate social welfare pension plus an occupational pension, each spouse is entitled in their own right to the PAYE tax credit.  As regards a pensioner couple where one spouse is a dependant ‘qualifying adult' on the other spouse's pension book, the PAYE tax credit is due only to the spouse who has an entitlement to the pension and a separate PAYE tax credit is not due in respect of that element of the pension payable in respect of a dependant ‘qualified adult'.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	411	It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to taxes on income and accordingly I will address my reply to income tax, PRSI and income and health levies.  Persons aged 70 years and over are not liable to pay health levy contributions and PRSI contributions are not payable by persons aged 66 and over.  They are however subject to income tax on their taxable income and to income levy on their aggregate income unless this income qualifies for specific exemptions provided for in the legislation relating to these taxes.With regards to income tax, a person aged 65 years or over is exempt from income tax if his or her income does not exceed €20,000 for a single person or €40,000 for a married couple (in the case of a married couple this treatment will also apply if one spouse is under 65 years and the other is aged over 65 years). These thresholds are increased if the person has dependent children.  In cases where it is more favourable, a marginal relief system is available for incomes rising slightly above these thresholds where 40% is applied on all income above the threshold.  If a person's income is in excess of these thresholds and not on marginal relief, income tax is chargeable on the person's taxable income, or in the case of a married couple on the couple's joint taxable income, with the tax due being reduced by the amounts of any tax credits (including age credit) due to the person or the couple.In relation to the income levy, a person aged 65 years and over will not have a liability to income levy if he or she meets any of the following conditions:The person has an entitlement to a full medical card for any part of the tax year, orThe person's aggregate income for the tax year, excluding social welfare payments, is less than €20,000 for a single person, €40,000 for a married couple.Married couples, where one or both are aged 65 years or over, whose combined income does not exceed €40,000 are entitled if they have had income levy deducted from their income, to make a claim to Revenue after the end of the tax year for a refund of all income levy deducted.In addition to social welfare payments, or similar type payments from other departments, being disregarded for income levy purposes, a number of other income sources that have been provided with a specific exemption from income tax are also exempted from the income levy. A list of these exempt sources is set out in Appendix B of the Frequently Asked Questions document on the income levy which is available on the Revenue website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/spotlights/income-levy.html.

This treatment is in accordance with the general rule which applies in relation to the calculation of such profits.From a VAT perspective, where VAT forms part of the charge for a toll road  service and the service is used by a taxable person for the purposes of taxable supplies, then the taxable person may claim that VAT as an input credit deduction in his/her VAT return. Again, this treatment is in accordance with the general rule which applies in relation to VAT on qualifying business expenses.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Organisations such as An Bord Altranais are established under statute.  In the case of An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board), it was established under the Nurses Act, 1985, and is the statutory regulatory body for nurses and midwives. The Board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister, 2 of whom are representatives of the Department of Health and Children.Under the Act the Minister has a range of functions in relation to the Board one of which, Section 17 (1), relates to the officers and servants of the Board "In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there shall be appointed such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Board, as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines."   The Act also provides that the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 applies to the Board and its officers and servants as if it were a local authority.In addition to its statutory functions, the Board also administers the Nursing Careers Centre on behalf of the Health Services. For this purpose ongoing funding is provided by the HSE and the amount of this funding in 2007 was €600,000.While the bulk of the Board's income is generated by fees paid by nurses and midwives, it and bodies similar to it,  are statutory bodies whose staff have access to a public service pension scheme. They are thus covered by the recent Government decision that, with effect from  the 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts. Therefore, when vacancies arise each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.

In 2002, approximately €39m was invested.  By 2007 this figure has increased to approximately €86m.  The 2008 outturn is in the region of €115m.In addition to the construction of new units, the Health Service Executive (HSE) provides funding to upgrade existing premises.The Executive's delivery of Community Nursing Units (CNU) and the upgrading of existing facilities is informed by the Prospectus Report which identified and prioritised the areas of greatest need and developed a programme of additional and replacement long stay residential places.  This report indicated that in general, it would be more cost effective to replace rather than upgrade and refurbish the majority of the existing bed stock which didn't meet current guidelines.  However, in cases where it is necessary to upgrade facilities to meet the standards it is a matter for the HSE to prioritise this expenditure within its Capital Plan and in this regard the Executive is working on an Action Plan to prioritise a phased programme of refurbishment and replacement of existing public nursing homes to meet the new standards.  As the Deputy's question is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

All funds required to make these payments are retained in the PPP fund and are available to transfer.  The HSE will be in a position to commence actual payments in the next couple of weeks.The HSE is continuing the validation of data on client balances nationally to allow the calculation of actual interest owed and assign that interest to existing clients' PPP accounts or arrange for the payment to be passed on directly to clients or their estate.

I would hope that early progress can be made in this regard.In addition to this the HSE and the three Dublin paediatric hospitals are also having discussions with a view to establishing the potential to improve the existing arrangements for the provision of paediatric orthopaedic services generally.My Department has asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy on the specific case raised.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	431	An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board), which was established under the Nurses Act, 1985, is the statutory regulatory body for nurses and midwives.  The Board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister, 2 of whom are representatives of the Department of Health and Children.Under the Act the Minister has a range of functions in relation to the Board one of which, Section 17 (1), relates to the officers and servants of the Board “In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there shall be appointed such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Board, as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines.”
The Act also provides that the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 applies to the Board and its officers and servants as if it were a local authority.In addition to its statutory functions, the Board also administers the Nursing Careers Centre on behalf of the Health Services.  For this purpose ongoing funding is provided by the HSE and the amount of this funding in 2007 was €600,000.While the bulk of the Board's income is generated by fees paid by nurses and midwives, it is a statutory body whose staff have access to a public service pension scheme. It is thus covered by the recent Government decision that, with effect from the 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Therefore, when vacancies arise each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.My Department has been advised by An Bord Altranais that it has 45 staff, 10 of whom are employed on fixed term/purpose contracts.  Since the ten temporary staff concerned are employed by An Bord Altranais detailed information as to the actual savings arising from the non-renewal of their contracts in 2009, 2010 and 2011 is not readily available to my Department.  However it is understood from An Bord Altranais that the associated payroll costs are in the region of €330,000 per annum.A submission received from the CEO of the Board in relation to this matter is currently being considered in my Department.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.The HSE circular which has issued gives effect to the Government decision on the moratorium in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework. Section 7 of this circular deals specifically with emergency interventions to maintain critical front-line services and contains provisions to address emergency clinical risk issues.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

The NAC is chaired by the OMCYA and has representation from relevant Government Departments (i.e. Justice, Equality & Law Reform, Environment, Heritage Local Government, Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs including the functions of the National Drugs Strategy Team) and Agencies, Youth Services and the voluntary and community sectors.In light of the current fiscal climate and in an effort to preserve service provision and to allow for the expansion of the YPFSF to 4 new towns of Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford the NAC agreed that the Small Grants should not be provided in 2009.I am fully aware of the success of this Small Grants Fund and of its benefits to local and voluntary community groups and my officials are keeping the matter under review.

However, I can confirm that no prompt payment interest has been incurred by my department to date in 2009. It is a policy of my department to adhere to the European Communities (Late Payments in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 in relation to prompt payment. All invoices authorised for payment are paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition there are a number of agencies funded directly by my Department.  The agencies have indicated that they adhere to the 30 days allowed in the Prompt Payment Legislation in respect of goods and services received. The National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Irish Medicines Board have negotiated contracts with their suppliers allowing for payment within 45 days. My department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Services Executive to have a reply issue directly to the Deputy on this matter.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 136 and 137 together.There is no question of closing acute hospitals, or of "downgrading" the services they provide. The fundamental objective of Government health policy is to maximise the health status of the population.  The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.It is widely recognised that treating a low volume of cases in higher-volume specialties is not conducive to optimal patient care.  In order to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, clinicians must be able to maintain their specialist skills by treating a sufficient number of cases.  It is more difficult for specialists to maintain their skills in smaller hospitals when treating a low volume of patients.  This has implications for how we organise acute services generally.The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised in particular regions.  These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services in the regions concerned, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, and surgical services.  Importantly, the re-configuration of services also involves developing smaller hospitals to provide a much greater proportion of less complex care, especially in day surgery, medicine and diagnostics. This underlines the fact that smaller hospitals can be reconfigured to provide important services for their local community, rather than being diminished or "downgraded".The Government is committed to a process of change which is incremental and which involves appropriate consultation and discussion with those affected.  The HSE is proceeding on this basis.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.Since 1999 a total of 209 reports have been commissioned by my Department.  This spans a ten year period of widespread reform, huge technological advances, service expansion and fundamental change in our health system.  The names of these reports are set out in the tables below.Health is an extremely complex environment involving a broad spectrum of primary and acute care services for the entire population, ranging from services for children and families, services for older people, mental health services and disability services. The nature, cost and burgeoning demand for services require that a strong emphasis be placed on the evidence base for policy and resource usage. While certain reports (such as the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System and the report of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service) can be identified as having a far reaching impact on the structure and management of our health services, it is not possible to isolate one report or set of reports as providing a template for the delivery of health services.Many of the reports can be traced back to the development of services for cancer, cardiovascular health, health promotion and the subsequent evaluation of these strategies. A number of the reports deal with complex and ethical issues, for example, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and the Green Paper on Abortion.A strong feature of a number of the reports related to engagement in widespread public consultation. National and international expert advice is critical and vital components in the development of health strategy.Reports have also been commissioned in the area of standards in health care. It is often argued that we don't give sufficient attention and prominence to the development and articulation of standards or best practice in the area of health and personal social services.  Medical error is a feature of medical systems world-wide and Ireland is no exception. The reports of Independent Inquiries form an important part of the body of knowledge which reflects a responsive and accountable health system. Examples of these include the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of Persons with Haemophilia and Related Matters and the Fitzgerald and Doherty reports into cancer misdiagnosis. Such Inquiries serve the public interest and ensure that we take appropriate corrective action to learn from experience and address the systems failures.The commissioning of external reports is very much part of a modern and effective administrative system and helps to inform the development of policy, regulation and legislation for the health sector as well as serving the public interest. There is, and will continue to be, a need for objective, independent and expert review and evaluation of health services and health outcomes into the future.Name of ReportA review of Oral Health

There are three General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) for Britain and Ireland. CIL are the authority for all of Ireland, the Northern Lighthouse Board for Scotland and the Isle of Man and Trinity House for England and Wales.The entire system of lights and navigational aids is funded by the General Lighthouse Fund (GLF) as a single financial unit.  Expenditure is met from the GLF which derives its income principally from the collection of light dues levied on commercial shipping at ports. The three GLAs spend a total of almost £100 million each year to provide the service. This arrangement predates the foundation of the State. The British Government does not provide any funding towards the lighthouse service.The light dues collected at Irish ports are supplemented by annual Exchequer contribution to the GLF so that the total revenues from sources in the State account for 50% of expenditure by CIL in the State or 50% of 70% of CIL's total expenditure. The remaining 50% is met out of GLF revenues from UK Light Dues.A review of funding of CIL has been underway since February 2007. The review followed sustained pressure over many years in the UK by shipowning interests which complained that they were, in effect, subsidising the Irish lights service to an unreasonable extent.Negotiations are continuing with the UK Department for Transport on all elements of funding arrangements including any implications for the Irish Exchequer contribution.UK authorities have indicated that they support continuing the service as a single integrated system covering Britain and Ireland. The lighthouse authorities' operations are being examined with a view to maximising the benefits of the integrated system in the interest of safe navigation in both Irish and UK waters.I am to meet Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, UK Under Secretary of State for Transport, today (21 May 2009) and will be discussing these matters with him.

In practice, however, these types of applications are usually made by the legal representatives of the persons concerned and in the main must set out any new facts or circumstances which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made. Any such application submitted would be considered on its merits, having due regard to all refoulement issues, and following such consideration, a decision would be taken to either affirm or revoke the Order.

The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to be decided on the basis of his identified operational needs.  I am advised that the personnel strength at the Station was doubled from 1 Garda to 2 Gardaí in August 2008.The Commissioner recently launched a new National Model of Community Policing for An Garda Síochána.  A National Community Policing Office will be established within the Garda Community Relations Section and it is intended that every District Officer throughout the country will take ownership of community policing within their area of responsibility.  Community Policing personnel will be appointed to each Community Policing Area which is to be designated at local level in consultation with the National Community Policing Office.Any plans for the refurbishment of the existing station will be considered by the Garda authorities in the context of overall priorities and available maintenance budgets.

I am, generally speaking, satisfied to accept that an applicant is self supporting if there is no evidence that he or she has accessed State support in the 3 year period prior to the date of application or subsequently and has satisfied officials that they have supported themselves independently in that period. The persons mentioned in the Deputy's Question both availed of State support in the three year period prior to the date of application or subsequently. Consequently, I refused their applications.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I wish to inform the Deputy that as of 21 May, 2009 there were 3,641 permanent beds available in the prison system.  On the same day there were 3,860 prisoners in custody. This represented an occupancy total of 106%. This is in contrast to the situation at the time of my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 239 where on 18 December, 2008 there were 3,611 permanent beds available in the prison system and there was a total of 3,656 prisoners in custody. This represented an occupancy total of 101%.  On 21 May, 2009 there were 2,540 cells/spaces available to the Irish Prison Service and all these cells/spaces were used for the purpose for which they were intended. These do not include cells/spaces used for special observation purposes or other cells/spaces used for administrative purposes. The breakdown of the cells/spaces used on 21 May, 2009 is set out in the table below.Total number of cells occupiedSingle Cells
(1 person only)Double Cells
(2 persons only)Treble Cells
(3 persons only)4 man cells
(4 persons only)Other  (More than 4 persons)2,5401,6456631923010It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts and it does not have the option of refusing committals. On 21 May, 2009 there were bed vacancies in Loughan House (16) and Shelton Abbey (5), both open centres. It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by approximately 330.  This represents a 9% rise in the number in custody. The provision of an extra 1,300 prison places in recent years has in some way addressed the issue of overcrowding which had become a chronic problem for the prison system.It is clear that in some of our prisons we are operating in excess of our bed capacity at this time.  In the short term, the issue of increasing bed capacity in our prisons will be addressed by the provision of an additional 400 prison spaces later this year. This additional accommodation is built and ready for commissioning and consists of:a new remand block in Castlerea Prison which will accommodate approximately 100 prisoners;a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will accommodate approximately 150 prisoners;a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will accommodate 150 prisoners.Most recently over 30 extra spaces have been made available at the open centre at Shelton Abbey and a further 40 spaces have been made available at the open centre at Loughan House.  It should also be borne in mind that our prisons have contingency plans in place whereby they can accommodate numbers above their ideal working capacity.In relation to the recent decision to discontinue negotiations with the Leargas Consortium on the construction of the prison at Thornton Hall, I wish to reiterate that the Thornton project will go ahead but we simply must find a more affordable solution for the taxpayer and the taxpayer must get better value taking into account what is happening to prices in the construction industry. I can confirm that it is my intention to bring comprehensive new proposals to the Government in a matter of weeks on how we can proceed with building a new, modern, regime orientated prison complex at Thornton. I am confident that my revised plans will meet the twin objective of giving us modern accommodation and best protecting the taxpayers' interests.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	483	As stated on many occasions in this House, most recently on 23 April, I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka and in particular about the grave humanitarian crisis that is taking place there. I fully endorse the conclusions of Monday's EU External Relations Council, which stated that "the EU ... is appalled by the loss of innocent lives as a result of the conflict and by the high number of casualties, including children, following recent intense fighting". I am also deeply disturbed by the reports of serious breaches of international humanitarian law by both sides in the conflict and I am firmly of the view that these must be subject to independent review. I note that a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka will take place next week.The Government of Sri Lanka has declared that the war is over and that they have won it. The LTTE have admitted defeat. The immediate priority now must be to ensure the safety and welfare of all displaced civilians. This is going to be an enormous undertaking as there are already over 200,000 requiring assistance and at least 50,000 more who will be seeking it in the coming days. The Government of Sri Lanka must fulfil its obligations under international law to protect all people under its jurisdiction. Camps in which displaced people are being assisted must be transferred from army to civilian control, entry to and departure from them must be strictly voluntary, and the camps must be temporary. Humanitarian agencies and independent observers must be given full access to these areas and the people in them.The second priority is to get a post-conflict strategy underway without delay. This will need to focus on reconstruction, economic and social development, and the restoration of basic services in the Tamil North. Hopefully, plans can be agreed with the Government to enable a comprehensive programme to be mounted.Thirdly, an inclusive reconciliation and peace process must be initiated. The fact that the war is over will not, of itself, achieve stability in Sri Lanka. It will be essential that arrangements and mechanisms are in place to ensure the representation of the Tamil population and facilitate dialogue, negotiation and reconciliation. I welcome President Rajapakse's stated intention to pursue a negotiated settlement with the Tamil community and very much hope that this can begin at an early date. Key to a successful process and sustainable peace will be a dialogue mechanism, based on the principles of parity of esteem, consent, equality and the rule of law. It will be important that the international community is involved in the peace process. International experience, expertise and support will be invaluable in terms of guiding the process, keeping it on track and serving as an independent facilitator. As I have stated in this House on a number of occasions, should the relevant parties there seek our advice in relation to the peace process, we would be happy to give consideration as to how we could best help.Ireland would welcome further action by the international community, in particular by the UN Secretary General and the UN Security Council, to assist in this process. I support an early visit by the Secretary General to Sri Lanka, as he proposes. In view of the serious humanitarian crisis in the affected areas, Irish Aid is now providing funding of €308,000 for emergency response through NGO partners, to include emergency medical and nutrition support, the provision of shelter, and distribution of food and non-food items. In addition, a member of Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps has been deployed to Sri Lanka to assist in the emergency response effort of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and to the south of the country, including in the Hatton-Rockall Area of the North East Atlantic. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Færoe Islands), both of which also make extensive overlapping claims. The UN Commission's rules of procedure prevent its consideration of a submission concerning an area of disputed continental shelf without the consent of the states concerned. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 (most recently in London before Christmas) but have so far failed to reach an agreement that would allow the Commission to consider a submission on the area concerned.In view of this, and in consideration of the 12 May 2009 deadline for the making of submissions that applies to Ireland, the Government recently authorised the making of a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area. This submission was lodged with the Commission in New York on 31 March. While the Commission's rules of procedure prevent its consideration without the consent of all the states concerned, submission at this time does preserve Ireland's legal position. In the meantime, the four states intend to keep the matter under regular review and we will continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of the submission by the Commission as soon as possible.Rockall itself, which is a tiny islet or rock and the only part of the Hatton-Rockall Area that is above water, is not relevant to these discussions. Although a matter of controversy during the 1960s and 1970s when sovereignty over such rocks and skerries was thought to be central to the mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas, the matter was effectively resolved in 1982 upon adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention. Article 121, paragraph 3 of the Convention provides that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf."Article 121(3) applies to Rockall. Ireland ratified the Convention on 21 June 1996. The United Kingdom acceded to the Convention on 25 July 1997. It is accordingly accepted by both sides that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or exclusive economic zones and the matter has not been relevant to the discussions that have taken place concerning the continental shelf in the Hatton-Rockall Area.Ireland has also made submissions to the Commission in respect of two other areas: nationally in respect of the area adjoining the Porcupine Abyssal Plain to the south-west and jointly with France, Spain and the UK in respect of a large area in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay. The Commission issued favourable recommendations following its consideration of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain submission and on foot of these the Government made an order under the 1968 Continental Shelf Act on 31 March last that incorporates 39,000 square kilometres of additional seabed in this area into the designated Irish continental shelf. The Commission has also recently made recommendations following its examination of the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay submission and these are currently under consideration by the four states concerned.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The demand of the Chagossian natives to return to the Chagossian archipelago is a complex issue involving competing sovereignty claims and legal arguments.In November 2000, the High Court of England and Wales found that the "wholesale removal" of the Islanders between 1967 and 1971 was an "abject legal failure". The Court ruled that the Islanders could return to the small outlying islands in the group but not to the largest, Diego Garcia, and granted the Islanders British citizenship. Following this ruling, the British Government commissioned a study on the matter which concluded that island resettlement would be "impractical and inconsistent with the existing defence facilities". A study commissioned by the Islanders contested this position. In November 2002 the Islanders launched a further action in the High Court of England and Wales claiming that they had been treated in such a way by the British Government as to entitle them to compensation and return of their property. In October 2003, the Islanders lost this claim for compensation.In June 2004 a royal decree was issued in Britain banning the Chagos Islanders from returning to the islands. In October 2004 the High Court agreed to a judicial review of the royal decree, and it was overturned in May 2006. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in May 2007. The British Government requested that the House of Lords examine this decision in June 2008, and in October 2008 the Law Lords ruled that the royal decree which imposed the ban on returning to the islands should stand. The Law Lords ruling is the final judgement in the British legal system. The group have stated that they may bring their case to the European Court for Human Rights.The Government will continue to monitor the situation of the Chagossian Archipelago. We would wish to see the issue resolved by agreement between the parties, and in a manner which properly addresses the unfortunate situation of the Chagos Islanders.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I deplore the arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma and esteemed Nobel Peace laureate, her imprisonment in the notorious Insein Prison in Rangoon and the laying of charges and institution of court proceedings against her.In a statement on 14 May, I condemned her arrest, saying that it represented the latest chapter in an ongoing effort to silence this courageous pro-democracy advocate and opposition leader before, during and after the elections which are due to be held in Burma in 2010. I noted also that her arrest and incarceration were particularly distressing given the very real concerns regarding her state of health. I made clear my view that Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners in Burma must be released and a process of dialogue and reconciliation initiated without delay.The EU Presidency also issued a Declaration on 14 May, deeply regretting the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and strongly urging the Burmese authorities to release her. The Declaration called on the regime to engage in an inclusive process of national reconciliation, which is essential for setting Burma on a genuine path to stability and prosperity, and to initiate a new phase in the development of the country.At the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting on 22 April, EU Foreign Ministers agreed the renewal of the Common Position on restrictive measures on Burma for an additional year. We also agreed to keep open the possibility of revising the Common Position in the light of developments on the ground. In this context, the situation in Burma was discussed again at the GAERC on Monday last and Ministers agreed that, following the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, the EU should look at new steps, including additional restrictive measures, which could be taken against the Burmese regime.Ministers at the GAERC also discussed the up-coming EU-Troika meeting with Burma which will take place on 25 May in the margin of the ASEM Ministerial meeting in Hanoi. There will also be an opportunity on the occasion of both the ASEM meeting and the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Phnom Penh which follows it, to convey to the representatives of many of Burma's neighbours who will be attending these meetings our very strong concerns and views about Aung San Suu Kyi, and the situation in Burma more generally. It is essential that we make clear to them, individually and collectively, how important it is that they use their influence in relation to the situation in Burma, including the position of Aung San Suu Kyi and the elections scheduled for 2010.I myself have repeatedly made clear the Government's view that the elections will have no credibility unless all political prisoners are released unconditionally and a political process is initiated with the support of the United Nations on the basis of an inclusive, long-term dialogue in which the opposition and ethnic groups can participate fully. I fully support the role of the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy, Dr Ibrahim Gambari, and the personal engagement of the UN Secretary General himself. I spoke to him about the situation in Burma when I was in New York on 8 May. I very much hope that Secretary General Ban will be able to visit Burma shortly, as he plans, and to making concrete progress on the political and humanitarian agenda there.I will continue to work in the EU and UN frameworks and with the countries of the region to do all possible to advance our objectives in relation to Burma.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	487	As the Deputy will be aware, payment of invoices by this Department is governed by the provisions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 as amended by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002. The Act, which came into force in January 1998, provided for the payment of interest on invoices which are unpaid after 45 days from date of receipt. In August 2002, the point at which interest becomes due was reduced to 30 days.While there are no figures available to establish the average time for payments made by my Department, its payment procedures are designed to avoid undue delay in the processing and payment of valid invoices. Every effort is made to make payments within the 30 day period, and the Department is generally successful in this.The number of late payments in each year represents a very small part of the total number of payments made. For example, in 2008, my Department made over 11,000 payments in Ireland, of which only 18 were late payments under the terms of the Acts mentioned above, less than 0.2% of the total payments made.There are no agencies operating under the direct responsibility of my Department.

The club in question was provisionally allocated €175,000 under the Sports Capital Programme in 2006 for dressing rooms only.  The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme specify that the Department will pay grants in stages as an approved project proceeds by reimbursing the applicant's costs when they submit original, paid, valid invoices or certificates of payment. The Department typically pays 70% of the value of the valid paid invoices submitted. In addition, the Department reserves 5% of the grant pending confirmation from a consultant or architect that the facility has been satisfactorily completed in all respects and that the defects liability period has expired.In the case of the club in question, the Department will shortly authorise the payment of €98,000 on foot of the valid, paid invoices received to date.   In order for the balance of the funding to be drawn down, subject to the retention arrangements already outlined, it is necessary that additional valid, paid invoices for works carried out in respect of the dressing rooms now be submitted.  My Department will write to the grantee in question shortly confirming the initial payment and outlining the steps necessary to draw down the balance of the allocation.

Her first payment of Carer's Benefit was credited to her bank account on 14 December, 2006, and an arrears payment was also credited to her bank account on this date which paid her Carer's Benefit for the period 1 June, 2006 to 13 December, 2006 and included a payment for  Respite Care Grant of Eur 1,200.00.  The award letter that issued to her on 6 December, 2006 informed her that payment included a Respite Care Grant of Eur 1,200.00.  She had also applied for the Respite Care Grant in respect of this care recipient to the Respite Care Grant Section on 31 August, 2006 and this was paid on 25 October, 2006.A natural justice letter issued to her on 22 February, 2008 informing her that she received two Respite Care Grants in respect of this care recipient in 2006, this letter also afforded her the opportunity to furnish within 21 days of the date of that letter, any statement or evidence she wished to make available to the Deciding Officer in the matter.  No reply was received to this letter.  Therefore, having regard to Section 302 (b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, a deciding officer found that the person concerned was not entitled to the Respite Care Grant which she received from Carer's Benefit Section in 2006. Accordingly she was overpaid by Eur 1,200.00 and this sum is recoverable by the Department.She was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the Independent Social Welfare Appeals Office on 22 April, 2009.

This type of mainstream advocacy is also open to people with disabilities.  The advocacy capacity is strengthened through the provision of Advocacy Resource Officers (ARO) who work to build the capacity of information providers within the Citizens Information Services to advocate on behalf of clients.There were nine Advocacy Resource Officers employed across the Citizens Information Service on fixed-term contracts of varying duration.  With regard to the contracts, three expired in quarter one 2009, a further three expire in quarter two 2009, and the remaining three will conclude in the first quarter of 2010.

To change to a monthly tax period would greatly increase the costs of administering motor tax and cause an adverse effect on all aspects of the current system.  Unlike other countries, we provide a short tax period of three months.  The introduction of one month tax periods would undermine the monitoring of compliance by vehicles in public places with motor tax requirements and create difficulties for enforcement.  There are no proposals to amend the current system.87% of the national commercial goods fleet pays the minimum tax goods rate of €288 per year.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  I am informed by the Board that on 31st December 2008 there were 104 staff employed.  Currently the Board employs 106 staff.  Five staff are currently on maternity leave.  No staff are currently absent on other forms of long term leave, such as, long term sick leave.As a non-commercial state sponsored body the NEWB must comply with the conditions of the moratorium on recruitment in the public sector.  While the Government Decision does allow for certain exceptions these will require the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  It is not possible at this point in time to give the number of staff in total that will be employed by the NEWB for 2009.  The current figure may not remain static particularly if staff decide to leave the NEWB during the course of the year.  Therefore it is not possible to accurately report actual numbers of staff who will be employed by the Board in 2009.The NEWB is one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance, to encourage more young people to finish school and to support parents and the wider community in addressing the individual needs of children at risk of educational exclusion.  These services are available to all schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for educational inclusion.  In line with Government policy the Board prioritises its resources to support schools participating in DEIS.This week I announced plans to expand the remit of the Educational Welfare Board from 1 September 2009, to include responsibility for the Home School Liaison and School Completion Services as well as Visiting Teacher supports for Traveller pupils.  The revised remit will bring together the individual services under one common management team which will provide for a single, more focussed, strategic direction at local, regional and national levels.  This integrated approach is part of the Government's overall approach to Transforming Public Services announced in November 2008.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	526	As I indicated to the Deputy in my response to Dáil Question No. 447 answered on 12th May last, I introduced a further innovation, in July of 2008 which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years, and who are being given approval for grant aid, to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.The level of funding available is outlined in the initial letter of approval from my Department to the schools. It is then a matter for the schools to decide which option to pursue.  As it is a devolved scheme schools may claim the first portion of the grant when the building works commence, 70% of the cost of the project, subject to receipt of the necessary certification and the balance when the project is completed.  A tabular statement giving details of the schools that have indicated their intention to pursue the provision of permanent accommodation is set out below.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  Following a survey of over 900 schools across the country my Department has set up a database giving details regarding their use of prefabricated accommodation.  The information gathered does not specify whether the accommodation in individual schools is entirely made up of temporary buildings.Separately, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level using the Department's recently commissioned Geographical Information System (GIS) and this will establish the position relating to the extent of all accommodation.  The specifications for this inventory are being drafted and my Department will be in contact with the education partners in relation to this later this year.The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the  necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.It is the policy of my Department to provide a permanent accommodation solution in so far as possible to meet accommodation demands presenting in schools.  However, the time span involved in architectural design and obtaining planning permission processes effectively means that, in all instances, it may not be possible to provide a permanent accommodation solution as soon as it is required and in these cases temporary accommodation is provided as an interim measure.In July of 2008, I introduced a new scheme which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years, and who are being given approval for grant aid, to avail  of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.I'm also introducing a new pilot project aimed at replacing rented prefabs with permanent modular buildings.  This project will be targeted at schools that have older rented prefabs and need long-term additional accommodation.  In 2009 almost €614 million will be spent on school infrastructure.  It represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation at a time of great pressure on public finances and is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.

Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.Overall post-primary accommodation requirements in the Dundrum area, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary school, will be considered in this regard.

However, arising from recently introduced improvements in superannuation, it will be possible for the person to reckon the service for superannuation purposes subject to meeting certain criteria and to payment of appropriate contributions.  Pending the finalisation of the detailed arrangements, my Department is processing the person's retirement benefits and expects to make an award to her shortly.  When all the details of the improvements are finalised the person's benefits will, if necessary, be revised.

In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class.  This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy.  Therefore, the school no longer qualifies to retain the class.These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation  Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.All children with MGLD who are in the classes being suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the General Allocation Model.  Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature.  My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  I wish to reiterate that pupils with a MGLD have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.

As the person mentioned by the Deputy is an asylum seeker who does not have an entitlement to work he is not eligible for free access to this course.  He may, however, access the course by paying the full economic cost of the course.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Combined classes are a feature of the majority of schools in the country and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  In terms of class sizes almost 80% of primary pupils were in classes of less than 30 pupils during the last school year. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will inevitably be differences in individual class sizes.  Some schools can have class sizes of greater than 27 or 28 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes.Where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.  In general, the view of my Department is that, where combined classes are formed, mixed-ability classes are preferable and my Department recommends random selection as a fair and educationally sound approach to the assignment of pupils to such classes.

The contract notice seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified contractors has been published on the public procurement portal www.etenders.gov.ie.

The appeal was made on the grounds of a change in circumstances. My Department examined the appeal and it was determined that there was not satisfactory evidence to prove a change in circumstance which is likely to be permanent therefore the decision of the assessing authority was upheld.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	539	A review of payments made by my Department during the first four months of 2009, to bodies classified as being outside of the public sector, showed that approximately 84.5% of payments were made within 15 days from the date of receipt of a valid invoice from a supplier, 12.5% of payments were made between 15 and 30 days while just under 3.0% of payments were made after 30 days. My Department seeks to ensure that prompt payment is made to all suppliers while at the same time satisfying the requirement, under the Public Financial Procedures, that invoices are correctly certified as being in order for payment. In a small number of cases, owing to the nature of some of the services supplied to the Department, analysis of invoices can be quite complex.With regard to agencies under the aegis of my Department the information sought is a matter for each agency and is not collated centrally.

The school's application for Major Capital Grant Aid has been assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed by the education partners, and has been assigned a Band rating of 2.1.My Department received a Stage 1/2 submission (Site Suitability, Site Report  and Initial Sketch Scheme) last year. Upon review there were a number of issues  raised regarding the submission by my Department's Planning and Building Unit.  A stage 1/2 Addendum was requested from the School's Design Team and this  addendum is currently with my Department for review.As the Deputy will be aware, in February, I announced details of 43 major  building projects to proceed to tender and construction and 25 high priority  projects to commence architectural planning. The project to which the Deputy  refers was not included in this announcement. Therefore the project is unlikely  to progress further this year.  As this situation is unlikely to change, the Department is of the view that a meeting would not be productive at this time.  Once the current stage is cleared, my Department will be in direct contact with  the school authorities regarding the status of the project.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  further progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded  to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which  relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.  The  decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC as appropriate.The Nationality requirement as set out in the 2008 Grant schemes states candidates must hold E.U. Nationality; or have Official Refugee Status; or have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); or be a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform adjudicates on a person's  entitlement to remain in the State and on the stamp that is awarded where  permission to remain is sanctioned. A ‘stamp 4' does not of itself convey any  entitlement to public services.It is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State  that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement  outlined in the Scheme.  Possession of a ‘stamp 4' does not automatically  satisfy the nationality requirement of the grant schemes. My Department  understands a ‘stamp 4' can be awarded to categories of applicants other than  those specified in my Department's grant schemes.
