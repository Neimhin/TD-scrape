#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As the Deputy is aware, in January 2007 the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts.  The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 was a monument, the preservation of which was of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government.  The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require my consent, as Minister, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, of which Nos. 14-17 Moore Street form part and for which approval has been granted by An Bord Pleanála, envisages the retention of these buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising in No. 16.  The developer's application to my Department for consent to these proposals under section 14 of the National Monuments Acts is being examined.  As Minister, my role in relation to the national monument site is to examine and make a determination on the consent application under the National Monuments Acts.  A decision will be made on the application as soon as possible.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I welcome the comments made recently by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.In the run-up to 2016 we are presented with a unique opportunity to protect and preserve this site.  This issue has come up time and again in questions to the Minister since my election to the House.  It is very important, not only to people in this country but also all over the world.  Does the Minister agree that the proposed development would effectively destroy the national monument and the potential to turn Moore Street into an historic quarter of international significance, with huge economic and tourism benefits?  Does he also agree that the single most appropriate proposal for the site, in terms of our history, heritage, culture, tourism and the economy involves the creation of a landmark historical quarter, as proposed by the families of the 1916 leaders, one which incorporates the GPO and the surrounding lanes which acted as the battleground in Easter week 1916, a defining period in the country's history?  Does he agree with the proposal and will he commit, with the help of others, including my party, Sinn Féin, to making it a reality?The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said he would ask Tourism Ireland to examine the matter.  Will the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, confirm that will happen?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me the chance to clarify the position.  It is important to note that my Department does not have a function in respect of the wider development site, of which the national monument forms part.  As Minister, my remit strictly covers the national monument site, encompassing Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, and the consent application relating to these buildings.  The development project as a whole has been through the planning system, from Dublin City Council to An Bord Pleanála.  There are no other statutory processes to be gone through.  My Department is considering further observations on the consent application received from the National Museum of Ireland in the past few days.  The museum's submission raises a number of issues that may warrant further discussion and consultation between my Department, the developer and the museum.  These will be dealt with as speedily as possible.  I have undertaken to keep the all-party Oireachtas consultation group on commemorative matters informed of developments in respect of the Moore Street monument in the context of its role in the 1916 Rising centenary preparations.  I do not envisage these proceedings being protracted and intend to make my decision on the consent application as speedily as possible.To be clear, my function only concerns the national monument.  Outside this, what has been determined by An Bord Pleanála and Dublin City Council is another issue.  I will take the matter very seriously.  Obviously, I will receive legal advice from the Attorney General's office and ensure the concerns expressed by the National Museum of Ireland, the response to which I have not yet seen, are fully examined.  All of the various aspects of the proposal in respect of the national monument will be considered fully and I will then determine what should happen, whether the project should go ahead.  If I reject the proposal for the site, the likelihood is that nothing will happen before 1916.  It is important to clarify that the State does not own the site which is in private ownership.  Obviously, it is under State protection as a national monument.  There are a number of matters that I must consider seriously before I make my final determination.

I am chairman of the 1916 commemoration committee and we are trying to do our best to ensure the events of 1916 which will be the focal point will be commemorated properly.  This, obviously, would be very much part of the commemorations.  I will reach a determination speedily in consultation with all of the interested groups involved, including my colleagues in the Oireachtas.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The millennium of the Battle of Clontarf will be commemorated in 2014.  This signal anniversary presents a special opportunity to enhance the appreciation and understanding of the Vikings in our national history, their settlement in centres throughout Ireland and contribution to economic and cultural life in Ireland.  Officials from my Department have had discussions with various groups, including historians, archaeologists and the ambassador of Denmark, with a view to developing a commemorative programme that reflects the influence of the Vikings in Ireland and the Battle of Clontarf as a defining event in our history.Operating under the aegis of my Department and within the confines of available resources, I envisage that the national cultural institutions will play an important role in any commemorative arrangement, especially the National Museum of Ireland.  In that context, I understand the National Museum of Ireland intends to hold a major exhibition on Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf in 2014.  It is expected that the exhibition will have an international focus, with loans from institutions across Europe.  The exhibition will not only present Ireland and Europe in the later Viking age but also examine the continuing significance of Brian Boru and Clontarf in Irish folklore and popular imagination right up to modern times.  In addition to possible initiatives by the national cultural institutions, my Department will be consulting local authorities and other interested parties with a view to the development of a co-ordinated programme.  I will convene a meeting in early course of the key parties, including the Danish and Norwegian ambassadors, to progress these plans further.  I expect to receive a report on planned activities in the autumn.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I welcome the Minister's indication he is planning ahead and linking up with organisations, statutory bodies and voluntary groups with a view to commemorating the Battle of Clontarf in 2014.  I hope it will be remembered in a respectful way, with an acknowledgement that on Good Friday, 23 April 1014, almost 10,000 people lost their lives at Clontarf.  Brian Boru lost more than 4,000 men and himself died in the battle, while the King of Leinster and his Viking army suffered 6,000 losses.  Does the Minister agree this is a significant part of our history which deserves to be commemorated properly?  Will the Minister support the people of Clontarf and the north side of Dublin, as well as the Clontarf Business Association, in their endeavours to have a millennium commemoration that is a major national and international event?  Does he agree there is potential in this occasion for job creation, arts, tourism and economic development?  Will he, together with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, promote this event internationally, especially with colleagues in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, with a view to enhancing tourism links with those countries?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I agree the 1,000th anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf is a very important event.  It is worth noting that the 4,900 soldiers on Brian Boru's side, mostly Munster and Connacht men, were faced in battle with 4,000 Leinster men and 3,000 Vikings.  In other words, it was not a case of Ireland against the Vikings but, essentially, Munster against Leinster aided by the Vikings.  That scenario has since been repeated on the rugby field on many occasions.  In fact, the great Irish rugby star Keith Wood is planning a major event at Killaloe, from whence Brian Boru made his departure for Clontarf.  Mr. Wood is very far advanced in his preparations in that regard and I will give him every possible support in his endeavours.All the other aspects of this commemoration, including arts, music, our marine heritage and so on, will be examined.  It is an exciting opportunity as part of the broader programme of commemorations taking place in the coming years.  The year 2014 is also the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.  The millennium commemoration of the Battle of Clontarf will afford us an opportunity to examine the contribution the Vikings made to this country, of which the young people in the Visitors Gallery are undoubtedly aware.  As a history teacher I was always careful to portray the Vikings as more than mere raiders.  They were very much involved in trade, craft, art and so on.  Apart from the plundering of our monasteries at Lambay and elsewhere, we should not forget their contribution to our cultural heritage and to the development of our major towns and settlements.

There is also potential for the development of sports and tourism initiatives.  There is an opportunity to invite people to come to the country at a time when we are encouraging members of the Diaspora to visit.  We should do this at an international and local level.  The people of Clontarf are up for this game and want to get involved.  A lovely event has been planned for 9 June, the Clontarf Viking Festival, to be held in the Clontarf yacht and boat club beside the wooden bridge at the Bull Wall.  There are ideas to be developed, but the Minister did not answer the question.  Will he meet the people on the ground who want to develop them?  He says he is looking for ideas for an economic stimulus and job creation in arts and tourism; this is a great one.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Deputy knows my door is always open.  I have met 2,500 groups and individuals and if people wish to meet me to discuss this issue, I will be delighted to meet them, with the Deputy.  No doubt, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, would be interested in this issue too.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The report on the Peatlands Forum from Mr. Justice John Quirke recommended that a national plan be prepared to examine how Ireland's 53 raised bog special areas of conservation are to be protected.  It was considered that, in the context of such a plan, it might be possible to bring some flexibility within the terms of the EU habitats directive that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites.  The Government accepted the recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke at its meeting on 7 March.  On 8 March Dáil Éireann unanimously supported a motion which called on the Government to "engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan".  On 3 April, together with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, I met EU Environment Commissioner Potočnik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a national raised bog SAC management plan.  The Commission also agreed to assist and provide support for Ireland in preparing this plan, within the framework of the habitats directive.  The Government agreed to maintain close and intensive engagement with the Commission on the preparation of the plan.My Department will now accelerate the process of putting the plan in place, giving specific priority to identifying the issues around the most difficult bogs, with the intention that it be developed in the coming 12 months. The Plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving and managing the affected bogs, and allow solutions for turf cutters to be explored in detail.While the Plan is being prepared, no turf cutting can take place on the protected bogs.  However, as the House is aware, a flexible package of compensation for turf cutters has been put in place.  Those who want to cease cutting turf completely can apply for compensation of €1,500 per annum in the next 15 years.  Eligible cutters are also entitled to a one-off payment of €500 for this year.  This means the total compensation package is worth €23,000, index linked and tax free.  For those who wish to continue cutting, my Department is working to relocate turf cutters to alternative bogs.  The first of these relocation bogs will be ready this year, but, where they are not available, turf cutters can choose, in the interim, between the financial compensation or the delivery of 15 tonnes of turf annually.  They will also be entitled to the one-off €500 payment.  To date, more than 1,700 applications for compensation have been received by my Department.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I acknowledge the work the Minister has done in this regard and the work done by Mr. Justice Quirke in the consultative process.  It is fair to say that for successful conservation, we need a positive spirit of partnership.  That is why there is grave concern when major stakeholders such as the TCCA walk away from the talks.  On 14 March the Minister raised everyone's expectations and gave people on all sides reasons for hope.  It was great headline-grabbing stuff, but to date, it has not been followed through.What action did the Government take to preserve the priority habitats within its control before beginning its pursuit of small domestic turf-cutters?  Has it received support from the EU Commission in respect of formulating a national plan?  Why are Department of Defence personnel ferrying staff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service about the place in order that they might monitor the activities of domestic turf-cutters?  What is the cost of this to the Department of Defence, which is closing down Army barracks in the interests of cutting costs?  When will it be realistically possible for the Minister to bring this matter to a successful conclusion?  Does he have any hope with regard to whether it will be possible to bring the TCCA back on board?  A number of people signed up for compensation but they have been waiting a damn long time for it.  This is creating a disincentive for others who may be considering signing up for it.

That was the intention behind the motion, that is what I accepted and that is what I have done.  The Commission has engaged with us and is going to provide us with services.  This is both a major development and a major departure.As the Deputy is aware, his party did absolutely nothing in respect of this matter for ten or 12 years.

Fianna Fáil used a derogation in respect of which it did not even obtain permission from Europe and it allowed one third of the designated areas on which we signed off with Europe to be taken away over a ten-year period.I inherited this problem and, as stated on previous occasions, the first thing presented to me when I entered my Department was a letter of formal notice that was sent to the current leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Martin, at the end of January 2011.  In that letter, Deputy Martin was informed that as a result of the inaction of his Government - which was replaced shortly afterwards - the European Commission was taking Ireland to court.  When I was appointed, I immediately established the Peatlands Council and I put in place a scheme of compensation for people who were affected.  In the first instance, that scheme applied in respect of those who previously worked the 33 affected bogs.  The amount of compensation available last year was €1,000 per individual and this has been increased to €2,000 in the current year.  The Peatlands Council made a recommendation to the effect that we should deliver fuel to those people who are affected.  The initial proposal in this regard was 10,000 tonnes but I increased this to 15,000.

The Air Corps is used by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The latter uses it to carry out monitoring with regard to the single farm payment.

The Air Corps takes the opportunity presented by working with the Departments to train its personnel.  The cost involved is quite small.  In 2010, the total cost of relating to the Air Corps providing assistance to the National Parks and Wildlife Services was €13,320.  This amount related to 72 hours of flight time.  The cost of utilising private contractors has been approximately €12,000 to date.My Department does not have enough manpower to supervise all of the various bogs.  Deputy Mattie McGrath should note that fines of €25,000 per day are hanging over us at present.  This amounts to €9 million per year.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I acknowledge the work done by the Minister since taking office in establishing the Peatlands Council and commissioning the Quirke report.  I do not disagree with any of these developments.  In 1997 the habitats directive was signed by the last rainbow coalition Government.  This issue has been ongoing since.  There was a ten-year derogation period and it is a pity the former Minister, John Gormley, did not act more decisively on the issue.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I acknowledge that.  If the European Union is so supportive of the national plan, why can it not allow domestic turf cutting to continue on these bogs for 12 more months while the plan is being put in operation?  What has the Government done to preserve priority habitats in its own control?  It seems it is quite willing and able to go after the small domestic turf cutter, while priority habitats in its control are not properly preserved.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The European Commission signed up to the national plan for the 53 SACs, special areas of conservation.  I hope within this an accommodation may be found for turf to be cut on the designated bogs.  The only condition it imposed in agreeing to the plan, a major departure, was that there be no turf cutting this year.  The Commissioner was quite clear about this.  I know the Deputy, on behalf of his party, is getting very exercised about this issue.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I have been exercised about it since I was elected.

Up to 1,700 turf cutters have applied for compensation.  People are taking this matter seriously and do not want to break the law.  I have been supportive of helping them in this regard.  We signed up to the habitats directive which was transposed into Irish law and we were supposed to implement it.  I am trying to help people to find alternative sources of fuel.  That is all I can do, as I cannot change the law.  All I can do is secure adequate compensation for turf cutters to ensure they will not be affected by these designations.  That is the bottom line.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am concerned about the damage caused by the theft of metal in recent times.  This relates not only to protected structures but also to valuable sculptures and other public art works.  This is part of a broader increase in the theft of metals from both private and public spaces owing to increased metal prices worldwide.  I am aware this is a matter of concern to the Garda Síochána generally.  I understand it has established a metal theft stakeholder forum involving stakeholders affected by this type of crime.  Staff of my Department have taken part in the Northern Ireland heritage crime summit organised by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland to share information and experience in dealing with the broader issues around heritage crime, including tackling metal theft.It is important to get a clear picture of the scale of this threat in respect of protected structures.  My Department will be issuing a circular shortly to all planning authorities outlining specific advice on the approach to be taken to address instances of criminal damage to protected structures.  The circular will also request that each authority maintain a record of details of any known acts of criminal damage and vandalism to historic buildings and, in particular, protected structures or proposed protected structures within each planning authority's remit.My Department's architectural heritage protection guidelines include advice on the avoidance of theft of architectural features and vandalism to protected structures.  However, the protection of the architectural heritage for both protected structures and architectural conservation areas is primarily the responsibility of the owner and for each planning authority to monitor and enforce.  The Department, through its structures at risk scheme, provides limited grant funding for local authorities that can assist with the repair of roofs and other areas of buildings which suffered from criminal damage.  In these cases my Department suggests metals stripped be replaced with an alternative material that would not be vulnerable to theft.As regards national monuments, the great majority are earthworks or structures which do not contain valuable metals.  Accordingly, the issue does not impact on monuments generally.

The answer is a load of waffle.  How could the Minister read that reply when the country is being stripped day and night?  At the Hume Street hospital site, close to the cameras at the Department of Justice and Equality, raiders broke in over a two-week period and stripped the entire roof and contents of the hospital before exporting their gains abroad.  Is the Minister saying the county councils and other bodies are supposed to mind these monuments?  I cannot believe a man like the Minister would read a nonsensical answer like that when his Government voted down a Private Member's Bill that I tabled for discussion six weeks ago.  Many of the speakers in Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil, Independents and other sides of the House were aware of the significant problem of theft of scrap metal, not only from private buildings but from public monuments as well.  A further fallacy told by the officials is that most monuments are structures; all of these have a lead lightning conductor for protection, and they are being raped and plundered.  It is time the Minister's officials, the Garda and everybody else woke up and faced facts.  I would be delighted if the Air Corps supplied aeroplanes to help catch these robbers rather than catching the ordinary people of Ireland who are trying to keep themselves warm by cutting some turf.The ICMSA, the Georgian Society, Muintir na Tíre and many other bodies have lobbied about this issue.  Under our eyes our national structures are being plundered.  We are putting up new structures with the 1% for arts schemes across the country in conjunction with road and other projects.  They are being taken down every night.  The Minister has come in with this answer but he should do more research rather than accept that waffle.  The figures hold the proof.  The Minister has made disgraceful allegations about another Deputy, which is unbecoming.  He has not heard the last of it.

Lead and copper was taken from the roof of that church and, as a result, the building was damaged.  The 1% for arts scheme is a good scheme but a number of sculptures and ornamental works produced under it have been taken.  It is difficult to prevent this.  More vigilance is needed with more people watching out.  I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath this is a problem and we will have to address it.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 135, 416, 418, 428 and 429 together.Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr. Conor Skehan, chairman of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Bord na Móna and representatives of turf cutting and environmental groups.  This forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog.The report on the forum from Mr. Justice Quirke also recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation are to be protected.  This recommendation was agreed to by Government.  Dáil Éireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members' motion which called for such a national plan to be put in place.  On 3 April, together with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, I met European Environment Commissioner Potočnik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a national raised bog SAC management plan which will be developed over the coming 12 months.  The plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving and managing the affected bogs, and will allow solutions for turf cutters to be explored in detail.  In the context of such a plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the EU habitats directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites.  The plan will be progressed both at local level for each site and through the Peatlands Council.For the plan to be a success, it is clear no unauthorised turf cutting can take place on the protected bogs this year.  Any widespread breach of the law would undermine everyone's collective efforts to develop the flexibility within the law which is being sought as part of the proposed national plan.  It is only within the context of a national plan that issues such as the provision of compensatory habitat can be considered.To date, there has been one significant incidence of cutting on one protected bog, with more minor incidences on four others.  My Department, with the support of the Garda Síochána, is taking appropriate enforcement action and is continuing to gather evidence for the purposes of pursuing the individuals involved.  The small minority who would wish to break the law are acting against the interests of the majority who are willing to work with my Department and the Peatlands Council to resolve outstanding issues.  This is demonstrated by the fact that more than 1,700 applications for compensation have been received to date under my Department's cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.Progress is also being made in regard to the relocation option under the scheme following the work done at the Peatlands Forum.  In this regard, my Department is making arrangements for assessing the suitability of a number of potential relocation sites.  Relocation arrangements have already been concluded with groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and Mountbellew in County Galway.  My Department and the Peatlands Council will continue to engage actively with turf cutting communities and representatives who wish to find acceptable solutions.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Some weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting turf cutters from the Moneybeg and Clare Island bog in Ross outside Mountnugent on the Cavan, Westmeath and Meath borders.  We met to get some details on the issues facing them.  They have been cutting turf for generations.  In some cases three or four generations of families have cut turf to heat their homes.  They use between 3 m and 6 m of bog per year.  As they cut, the bog they leave behind basically returns to its natural habitat.  One mile up the road there is industrial or commercial cutting of bog which is having a considerable effect on the water table, the lakes around the habitat and the top of the bog.  Compared with private families cutting bog, the private contractors are making a serious difference to the habitat.It appears to me and to many of these individuals that the Government is not fighting strongly enough for them.  These individuals should be allowed to cut turf this year as they have to deal with heating issues.  The Government is not putting Irish interests at the heart of their negotiations with Europe.  Is it not ironic that at the end of the month, those in the Government will be asking the citizens to hand away more powers to Europe so they can come back to the Chamber afterwards and say their hands are tied by Europe and they can do no more?  The turf cutters of Ireland should consider the upcoming referendum closely.  It is clear those in the Government are pulling more power away from the democratically elected people of the State.  They use the excuse that it is not their fault but the EU's on many other issues as well.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The referendum is a different issue.  As I explained previously to Deputy Troy, this issue has been around for some time.  We proposed that 53 bogs should be made special areas of conservation.  This amounts to approximately 2% of the total raised bog in the country.  We transposed this into Irish law and we gave a clear commitment to Europe that we would preserve these sites.  When I got responsibility for this issue, there was no renegotiation or wiggle room, as Deputy Tóibín has described it.  I was given the challenge of implementing the law.  As I have explained, we have made a good deal of progress during the past year.  I engaged with the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, and I hope they come back and renew the engagement they had previously.  They brought some good proposals I have implemented.  I hope the discussions continue.Those affected have the option this year of getting 15 tonnes of turf, a substantial amount, or €2,000.  This would enable them to buy oil or fuel to ensure they will have heat for the winter.  A generous compensation package is available and we are doing our best to secure relocation.  The process of examining the national plan and the difficult bogs will start shortly.  I hope at the end of the year we will come up with solutions, but this is a difficult issue that will require co-operation from everyone.  I appeal to everyone, especially those in the House, to co-operate.  Some Deputies from all sides of the House, including from Deputy Tóibín's party, have been helpful in this respect and open to solutions.  I accept this has been the case on all sides of the House.  This is something we must try to resolve together and as a country.  While I am in this position I will try to be all-inclusive with regard to finding that solution.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I welcome the opportunity to come back in if only to say that the Minister should note I do not have a new-found interest in the bogs.  This is the third or fourth time I have raised it on Question Time.  I come from a rural background and I know the issues full well.  I do not need to be lectured on the benefits of the bogs for rural Ireland.  I acknowledge the work the Minister has done thus far in respect of this issue but I do not believe he has gone far enough.  As the Minister has stated already, this issue dates back to 1997 when the Fine Gael party was last in Government and the habitats directive was signed into law.If the EU is supportive of a national plan, I cannot understand why those responsible will not allow time for the plan to be worked out between the Peatlands Council, the Government and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and also allow time to get the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association back on board again.  If those in the EU are supportive, this would not be an excessive request to make of them.  I acknowledge there is a mix of people.  Some are keen and content to cease cutting turf and are happy to take their compensation.  How long must they wait for it?  Many have been waiting a long time for their compensation.  Many others are looking to relocate.  What has the Government done to identify plots under its control and to relocate ordinary decent domestic turf cutters who want nothing more than to harvest their turf and provide fuel for their families?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The work of identifying plots has been successful at Mountbellew and Clara bogs.  This was done by the previous Government led by Deputy Troy's party.  It identified alternatives.  We have been working closely with Bord na Móna and Coillte to identify alternative bogs.  The process is under way and people from the National Parks and Wildlife Service are trying to find alternative bogs for people as we speak.Deputy Troy raised the question of the level of applications and the response.  To date 1,795 applications for compensation have been received under the scheme.  Some 381 payments have been made and a further 48 payments are scheduled by the end of this week.  Some 1,269 applications for compensation have been acknowledged by the Department.  Of these a total of 400 applicants have expressed an interest in relocating to non-designated bogs.  Last week, 349 letters issued offering those who have applied to sell bog plots to the Department under the voluntary bog purchase scheme the opportunity to transfer to the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme if they so wish.  There is ongoing intensive communication between my Department and those affected.  I have asked for this to be accelerated because I agree these people will be inconvenienced and they must be compensated properly and helped in every possible way.As a Minister of the Government I must implement the law.  That is the bottom line and that is my duty as a Minister.On the cessation of turf cutting this year, the Commissioner was adamant when we posed the question that for this national plan to proceed there had to be a cessation of turf cutting.

They are in limbo, so to speak, as far as knowledge and engagement is concerned.

#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	89	To set the record straight on the National Parks & Wildlife Service looking for bogs, obviously they have not read the plan put together by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association because we have already identified the vast majority of bogs people could move to if Europe and the State were reasonable.  Mountbellew was mentioned as an example of where a bog was found.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association found that bog.  The National Parks & Wildlife Service, through its different names over the years, had 14 years to find bogs and not one could they find.  One would imagine that if they were serious about their job and just to shut me up they would have said that there is a bog half a mile away from where we are cutting, but they did not even know that until we pointed it out to them.  Remarkably, they did not even know they owned it and therefore to go to those people to identify bogs would not be the best course of action.Information has come out in recent days which we had already, but apparently it has come out as new information and it is important that the Minister clarifies it.  It was put out by Deputy Denis Naughten in a press release and states that those who wish to invoke the right to seek permission to cut turf should send the request in writing to Minister Jimmy Deenihan.

If it was that simple, why did the Minister not do this in a big brush stroke and allow us all to continue cutting turf this year to enable this plan to be a success, which it would have been and still can be if common sense-----

Anyone can write in and apply but it would be difficult for some people to do that.  However, in the new plan we are establishing it is hoped accommodation will be made for the difficult ones.  That is something Deputy Flanagan has asked for, and it is the purpose of this plan.  The reason I accepted his motion at the time was because that is what he outlined.  We went back to Europe asking that we would have a national plan that would include accommodation for people in difficult bogs who cannot find any alternative.  That is what we are striving to do, and the national plan will start immediately.  I hope Deputy Flanagan will be able to support that.

Clúdaíonn an 105 scéim teanga sin 191 comhlacht poiblí.  Cé go bhfuil tuairim is 600comhlacht poiblí san áireamh faoin Acht, tá mé sásta go gclúdaíonn an105 scéim teanga atá i bhfeidhm mórchuid na gcomhlachtaí poiblí a mbíonn teagmháil rialta ag an bpobal i gcoitinne leo.  Ar ndóigh, de réir fhorálacha an Achta, tá feidhm ag scéim teanga ar feadh tréimhse trí bliana ón uair a dhaingnítear í, nó go dtí go ndaingnítear scéim nua, cibé acu is déanaí.  Mar sin, bíonn feidhm i gcónaí le scéim teanga go dtí go ndaingnítear scéim nua ina háit.  Anuas air sin, tá obair idir lámha ag mo Roinnse le comhlachtaí poiblí éagsúla chun tuairim is 100 scéim teanga nua a aontú agus a dhaingniú.Tá sonraí maidir leis na scéimeanna uilig atá daingnithe go dáta, mar aon leis na scéimeanna atá a n-ullmhú faoi latháir, ar fáil ar shuíomh idirlín Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, www.coimisineir.ie.Ó thaobh Ranna Rialtais de, bhí an chéad nó an dara scéim teanga daingnithe le gach Roinn sula ndearnadh athstruchtúrú ar Ranna áirithe i mí an Mhárta 2011, sin tar éis an toghcháin.  Mar thoradh ar an athstruchtúrú sin, scríobh mo Roinnse anuraidh chuig na Ranna ábhartha maidir lena gcuid scéimeanna teanga.  Mar Ranna nuabhunaithe, iarradh ar an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus ar an Roinn Leanaí agus Gnóthaí Óige scéimeanna teanga céaduaire a ullmhú.  Maidir leis na Ranna eile, tá oifigigh mo Roinne ag plé leo faoi láthair le súil go mbeifear ábalta scéimeanna a réitíonn dá gcuid feidhmeanna nua a aontú leo agus a dhaingniú a luaithe agus is féidir.  Tá céad scéim teanga mo Roinne féin, a deimhníodh le gairid, foilsithe anois, is é sin an Roinn úr, an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.Maidir leis an mhoill a bhain le scéimeanna teanga a aontú le tamall anuas, ní miste dom a mheabhrú don Teach gur chuir mo Roinnse tús le hathbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla anuraidh, is é sin ag Oireachtas na Gaeilge i mí na Samhna.  Socraíodh go dtabharfaí tús áite don athbhreithniú sin i bhfianaise an ghealltanais a tugadh ina leith i gClár an Rialtais 2011-2016.   Tá céimeanna suntasacha tógtha ag mo Roinnse faoin athbhreithniú, lena n-áirítear suirbhé agus próiseas comhairliúcháin poiblí a chur i bhfeidhm.  Fuarthas timpeall 1,400 freagra ar an suirbhé agus 240 aighneacht ó pháirtithe leasmhara, a bhfuil anailís ar siúl ina leith faoi láthair.Ar ndóigh, tá sé aitheanta nach bhfuil córas na scéimeanna teanga gan laigí agus gur próiseas casta é scéimeanna a aontú agus a dhaingniú. Tuigeann mo Roinnse chomh maith gur féidir leis an bpróiseas sin a bheith dúshlánach do chomhlachtaí poiblí, go háirithe leis an mbrú ar achmhainní mar atá i láthair na huaire.Ní miste dom a rá go bhfuil córas na scéimeanna teanga san áireamh mar chuid den athbhreithniú atá ar siúl faoi láthair ag mo Roinnse ar an Acht. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh moltaí fiúntacha as an athbhreithniú atá idir lámha, a chabhróidh linn aidhmeanna an Achta a bhaint amach ar bhealach níos éifeachtaí.  Déanfar an cás do leasú na reachtaíochta a bhreithniú mar chuid den phróiseas sin.Maidir le tuarascáil bhliantúil Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga do 2011, ní miste dom a rá gur oifig neamhspleách reachtúil í Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga agus, i gcomhréir le forálacha an Achta, go bhfuil an Coimisinéir Teanga neamhspleách i bhfeidhmiú a chuid dualgas.  An méid sin ráite, is féidir liom a rá gurb í príomhaidhm an Achta a chinntiú go gcuirtear feabhas ar sholáthar seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge.  Faoi alt 13 den Acht, caithfidh comhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú go bhfuil aird tugtha acu ar sheirbhísí a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge i gceantair Ghaeltachta agus iad ag ullmhú dréacht-scéimeanna teanga.  Ar ndóigh, faoi réir fhorálacha an Achta, is ar Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga atá an cúram féachaint chuige go bhfuil gealltanais atá tugtha ag comhlachtaí poiblí ina gcuid scéimeanna teanga á gcomhlíonadh acu.

Tá an Acht sin in áit ionas go mbeidh daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus ar fud na tíre in ann seirbhísí Stáit a fháil ina dteanga féin.  Faoi láthair, níl siad in ann é sin a dhéanamh i gcónaí.  Táimid ag caint faoi cearta teangacha anseo.  De réir taighde, tá nasc idir laghdú na Gaeilge agus an brú atá ar Gaeilgeoirí iompú go Béarla chun seirbhísí a fháil ón Stát.  Ní gá go mbainfeadh mórán costais leis seo.  Tá Gaeilgeoirí sa Státseirbhís.  Ba cheart córas earcaíochta ciallmhar a chur i bhfeidhm sa Státseirbhís.  Níl an chóras sin ag feidhmiú ar chor ar bith faoi láthair.De réir tuarascáil bhliantúil Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, a fhoilsíodh i rith na seachtaine, theip ar an Stát a ndualgaisí a chomhlíonadh anuraidh.  Níor dhaingnigh an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta aon chéadscéim teanga nua sa bhliain 2011.  Dhaingnigh an tAire an dara scéim teanga le comhlacht phoiblí amháin le linn na bliana sin.  D'fhág sin go raibh 105 scéim teanga, as 191 comhlacht poiblí, daingnithe tar éis na bliana 2011.  Bhí 66 de na 105 scéim teanga imithe in éag faoi dheireadh na bliana.  An bhfuil náire ar bith ar an Rialtas nó ar an Aire faoin gcúntas uafásach sin?  An aontaíonn an Rialtas go bhfuil sé uafásach nach bhfuil sé de cheart ag muintir na Gaeltachta, a íocann cáin freisin, a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid?Sheol Oifig an Choimisinéira Teanga 15 imscrúdú nua le linn an bhliain atá thart a bhain le comhlachtaí poiblí.  Léirigh dhá imscrúdú éagsúla nár chomhlíon an Roinn Coimirce Sóisialaí go cuí na dualgais reachtúla teanga i dtaca le marcanna bónais a thabhairt do chumas sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bhéarla i gcomórtais inmheánacha i gcásanna beirt oifigigh aimnithe.  Léirigh imscrúdú nár chomhlíon an Garda Síochána a ndualgais mar gheall ar an teanga a chur chun cinn i gceantair Gaeltachta.Léirigh imscrúdú eile nach raibh Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann in ann seirbhísí a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge chomh maith lena soláthar trí Bhéarla.  Rinneadh moltaí dírithe ar an mhéid sin a chur ina cheart.  Léirigh an scrúdú seo nach raibh aon dul chun cinn déanta san Ard-Mhúsaem agus go raibh an rannóg Stáit seo ag tabhairt neamhaird son dlí.  An bhfuil an Aire nó an Rialtas ina gcodladh sa chomhthéacs seo?  Tá siad ag teip go huafásach ar a gcuid dualgaisí.  Cad é plean an Rialtas chun an rud seo a chur i bhfeidhm i gceart?

Chomh maith leis sin, tá comhráití ag dul ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire idir an Roinn agus thart ar 100 comhlacht Stáit eile fá choinne teacht aníos le scéimeanna teanga.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar mo Roinn scéimeanna teanga a aontú agus a dhaingniú le comhlachtaí poiblí agus Ranna Stáit, taobh istigh de chúinsí Achta na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003.  Is dualgas reachtúil é de réir an Achta sin.  Ina dhiadh sin, tá sé de dhualgas ar na comhlachtaí Stáit na pleananna a chuireann siad ar aghaidh a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá sé seo an-thomhaiste ar fad.  Tá sé dubh agus bán in Acht 2003.Tá sé de dhualgas ar Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, mar oifig neamhspleách, monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar na gcomhlachtaí Stáit chun féachaint chuige go bhfuil na pleananna á chur i bhfeidhm acu.  Muna bhfuil sé sin á dhéanamh acu, déanann Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga é sin a lua ina dtuarascáil bhliantúil a chuireann sé inár láthair.  Má theipeann orthu arís na pleananna a chur i bhfeidhm, cuireann an oifig tuairisc speisialta chuig Tithe an Oireachtais.  Is é sin go díreach an méid a tharla an tseachtain seo caite.  Tá tuairisc curtha ag an gcoimisinéir roimh Tithe an Oireachtais ag rá nach bhfuil eagraíochtaí éagsúla ag cur na bpleananna i bhfeidhm mar ba mhaith leis go ndéanfaidís.  Tá an tuairisc sin roimh Tithe an Oireachtais anois.Tuigim go bhfuil an coimisinéir ag teacht isteach roimh coiste na Tithe seo - sílim go bhfuil an Teachta O'Reilly ina gCathaoirleach ar an gcoiste - i rith na seachtaine chun an gearán seo a dhéanamh.  Is ar Tithe an Oireachtais atá an dualgas é seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá mo dhualgas - na pleananna a aontú agus a dhaingniú - déanta agam.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar na gcomhlachtaí iad a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar an gcoimisinéir monatóireacht a dhéanamh orthu.  Tá sé sin an-shoiléir in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003.  Mar ionadaí, mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta agus mar Theachta sa Ghaeltacht, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh deis ag gach éinne sa Ghaeltacht nó taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Is é sin an polasaí atá ag an Rialtas chomh maith.Tá athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 agus ar ról an choimisinéara.  Tá sé sin ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tháinig 1,400 aighneachtaí agus 250 moltaí isteach.  Tá anailís á dhéanamh orthu i láthair na huaire.  Cuirfidh muid an anailís sin os comhair an Tí chomh luath agus a bheidh sí críochnaithe.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Central Bank has calculated, on the basis of a range of models, that residential property is now undervalued by between 12% and 26%.  In essence, it has indicated that houses people can afford are not moving.  This is having a significant impact on the economy, particularly the domestic economy.  What is particularly worrying is that banks appear to be doing their best to turn down loan applications from potential buyers.  Mortgage brokers all over the State are saying banks are turning away people with immaculate credit histories.  People with a clear ability to make repayments on mortgages are still not securing loans.  We have seen this already in a different category, namely, loans to small and medium-sized businesses.  It is very worrying that only 6,300 first-time buyers were able to get a mortgage in 2011.  This was 40% lower than the figure for 2010.  Clearly, that is a drag on the economy.  It is a very serious issue and of considerable concern.Essentially, the Central Bank seems to be stating the mortgage market is dead and that nothing is moving.  People who want and can afford to purchase their own home are not able to do so because the banks are not lending to them.  We all know that the level of mortgage transactions can have a very significant impact on economic activity such as the number of plumbers, painters and carpenters who will be employed, as well as retail activity levels in the hardware and DIY sectors.  There is a clear link between what is happening on the retail side and the lack of transactions on the housing side.  It seems the banks are failing to provide credit for families who are in a position to purchase houses.What does the Government intend to do about this?  When recapitalisation of the banks took place last July, there was a degree of optimism on the Government side that this would have a significant impact on investor confidence in the wider domestic economy, but this has not happened.   Where is there a lack of activity and why is there inertia from a policy perspective?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	113	This is a serious matter affecting everybody in the general economy, as everybody understands.  I recall the announcement made by the former leader of a party on this side of the House which led to a complete brake on the movement of houses in the market.  As the Deputy is aware, it is not generally the policy of the Government to interfere in the housing market.  Let it find its own level.  I am aware of the announcement by the Central Bank.On the banking sector, the general flatness of the indigenous economy and movement in the construction sector generally and the housing market in particular, the Government has reduced stamp duty on all commercial property transfers from 6% to 2%, removed capital gains tax on property held for seven years, raised mortgage interest relief from 15% to 25% for first-time buyers in 2012 which could yield savings of €5,000 per couple and has allowed mortgage interest relief for the next seven years, if residential property is bought in 2012.  From speaking to auctioneers, these moves have resulted in some movement but obviously not as strong as one would like.The indications are that Irish commercial property yields are at historically high levels owing to the fall of 65% in prices.  There has been significant foreign interest because of this.  I read in one of the newspapers a few weeks ago that there had been movement on €70 million worth of office space in one weekend.  The CSO statistics show that the asking price for property remained unchanged in March compared to the position in February.  There was a slight increase in parts of this city and the greater Dublin area.  There have been reports from estate agents of increased viewing figures for properties, as people decide whether they should trade up or down.The Economic Management Council held a number of meetings with Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank and mortgage lending was one of the key issues which arose.  Clearly, the case was made that some people had great difficulty in accessing mortgage credit owing to changed circumstances.  Younger people might be employed on contract only and some banks find it difficult to deal with this when approving mortgages.  Bank of Ireland set aside €1.5 billion for a mortgage lending fund and reports that it is seeing increased interest among buyers.  What we want to know is the scale of mortgages not just approved but also drawn down.  AIB has set up a similar fund worth €1 billion and indicated that it could increase if demand increases.  Ulster Bank has a dedicated fund and indicated it is willing to increase it if demand increases.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, it would be preferable if the construction industry was playing a proportionately stronger part in the general economy.  From speaking to auctioneers directly, there is evidence of increased interest and a slight indication of increased house prices in some parts of Dublin, although they are not anywhere we would like them to be.The Government will continue to interact regularly with the banks on the programme they have set out and in dealing with issues that arise for people who either cannot obtain mortgage approval or receive it with conditions attached that are too difficult for them to meet.  The banks' own programmes are worth €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively, while Ulster Bank has stated it will increase its fund if demand increases.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Taoiseach's answer is very unsatisfactory.  It lacks clarity and is somewhat confusing in its presentation.  According to the Central Bank, the facts are we have 40% fewer first-time buyers receiving mortgages this year than last year.  These are the facts.  We cannot articulate that some auctioneer told us he was beginning to see some interest.  Only 6,300 were able to secure mortgages in 2011.  This is having a very serious impact on the economy.  We know that the domestic economy remains flat and nothing that the Government has done in the budget or in recapitalising the banks has had an impact.  We should look at the totality of issues-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	A question, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Nothing has happened on the issue of mortgage arrears.  The issue of personal insolvency is still trundling its way through the legislative process.  Nothing has happened in respect of loans to small and medium enterprises.  This is stated in official reports at Irish and European level; it is not anecdotal evidence.  Now the Central Bank states people with very good records cannot get loans to buy very affordable houses by any model and standard.  That smacks of a set of policies that have not been working in the last 12 months.  The Taoiseach has indicated a range of measures that were taken.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	117	May we have a question, please?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Clearly, they are not having the desired impact.  Will the Government intervene in the context of the Central Bank's report, talk to the banks and ensure there is some activity?  On rents, we are doing very well.  Mortgage repayments would actually be lower than the rent being charged by landlords in some cases in the domestic market.  The domestic economy requires intervention.  This is a very simple measure that could be of help in employment creation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	119	As the Deputy knows full well, intervention in the housing market through various activities was a contributory factor in the country going over the edge.  The idea was portrayed that we could continue to provide all the services that the public needed but not pay for them because they would be paid for using the taxes coming in through property speculation.   The Deputy states there is no clarity.  The Government does not want to run the housing market.  I am sure he is not expecting it to intervene-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The Government has reduced stamp duty from 6% to 2% on all commercial properties, removed capital gains tax on property held for seven years and increased mortgage interest relief to 25% for first-time buyers in 2012 and it is to continue it for a period thereafter.   We have also had direct meetings with the banks.  We received confirmation from Bank of Ireland that it had set aside €1.5 billion for loans on residential properties, from AIB that it had allocated €1 billion, and from Ulster Bank that it was prepared to increase its fund if demand increased.  As people become aware that this is a significant year for the purchase of residential properties owing to increased mortgage interest relief, interest is, at least, being expressed.  I will not be happy, however, until there is confirmation of the drawing down of mortgages.  The Deputy knows that people have had mortgages approved but have not drawn them down, either because of lack of confidence or because such conditions were imposed that they were not able to draw them down.The economic management council and the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with mortgage arrears and mortgage distress will continue to have this as a priority.  We meet regularly about it, on the basis of establishing real progress.I am not a great defender of the banks but the programmes they have set out, if they can follow them through, are quite constructive.  Many of the people who work on the front line in branch offices throughout the country are working hard to re-establish a sense of trust with clients who might be interested in doing business with banks.  That is important, in re-orienteering - I mean reorienting - the importance of banks in the general economy.

It is a time of transition and of purification.  It is also the day when trade unions and working people across the world unite in solidarity and support of workers' rights.  In this State, however, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party are about the work of austerity and the erosion of workers' rights.  The European Trade Union Confederation has rejected austerity and the austerity treaty.Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go gcuirfí austerity and an conradh níos mó brú agus cruatán ar dhaoine atá ag obair agus ar a dteaghlaigh.  Ag an am chéana, tá a lán oibrithe gan chearta ar bith.In Vita Cortex which the Taoiseach visited, Wilson Publishing, Lagan Brick and, in my own constituency, in Vodafone, Diageo and Irish Cement, workers are having their rights trampled upon.  In Vita Cortex the workers are on the 138th day of a sit-in.Tonight, Sinn Féin will bring forward the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012.  On this May Day, or Lá Bealtaine, which is a time of purification and transition, will the Taoiseach commit the Government to supporting the Bill and to working constructively with Sinn Féin to close the loopholes some employers have used to ride roughshod over the rights of workers?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I met Vita Cortex workers some time ago and the matter was raised in the House on numerous occasions.  The workers told me that what they really requested was respect for the long years of committed and diligent service they gave to the firm.  I am aware of a number of recommendations that have been made and I understand that even in the past week or ten days, recommendations have been put, without prejudice, that might bring about progress.This is not the only situation where difficulties have arisen, and continue to arise.  The Government is anxious to use all the facilities of the State's machinery to resolve these problems.  I am aware of the intervention of the courts in respect of the Vita Cortex workers.  Some recommendations have been made there.  It is important, not only to have such facilities but that they be seen to work and to bring about successful conclusions.The Vita Cortex workers have put in an extraordinary campaign.  Their comment to me was not the usual one about money.  In their case it is about respect.  They deserve that.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	131	They also deserve the legal protection of the State, and they do not have that.  They deserve the legal protection of the Government, particularly a Government that has a Labour Party component.  Tonight's Bill will give the Taoiseach the opportunity to start that process.  It would need a suite of Bills to give workers the legal rights to which they are entitled.I visited many picket lines, including the Vita Cortex protest.  I am reminded of the Christy Moore song, "Ordinary Man".  People who have given 35 years of service have been told, "Sin é, you are out" and left floundering.  Tonight's debate will provide an opportunity for the Government to sign up and support the Bill.I know he does not mean it, but the Taoiseach occasionally says Sinn Féin never says anything positive.  Here is a positive initiative we have taken.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Yesterday, the Government parties launched their fiscal treaty referendum campaign.  There appears to be a problem of timing.  Parallel to the Government's launch of its campaign, throughout Europe there is a growing clamour for economic growth.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in France, where Monsieur Francois Hollande is leading the campaign for growth and has stated, ominously for some, that he will not sign "the fiscal treaty as is".  He has also stated emphatically that he will renegotiate that treaty.My advice to the Taoiseach is this.  Other nations throughout Europe are waiting to see the result of the French presidential election, the probable winner is Monsieur Hollande and only three countries have, so far, ratified the treaty.   As Ireland's primary interest is now growth, would the Taoiseach not join those forces in a campaign to install growth measures in the treaty, as is being suggested and championed by others in Europe who are likely to be in government this time next week?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Deputy Ross is moving around the spectrum.When it became my privilege to attend EU Heads of Government meetings, it was obvious that the issue missing from the agenda was growth and investment.  A number of other leaders, as well as myself, have consistently raised this, and that is now a fixed item on the agenda of every Council meeting.  That most recent meeting dealt with youth employment and small and medium enterprises.  There will be further reports on those issues at the May and June meetings.    It is not for me to interfere in any way with the comments or statements made by political leaders or parties in the final days of a presidential election in France or the election process in Greece which takes place on the same date.  I understand a number of regional elections will also take place in Germany on the same date.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The Taoiseach is following the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, in terms of it being Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	141	These parties and candidates are entitled to their views.  I have said I welcome any political or government leader in Europe who now joins, as Deputy Shane Ross calls it, in the clamour for growth and investment to be included as a fixed item in the Council agendas.  In that sense, he is aware that the treaty was signed by President Sarkozy.  An addition to the treaty in respect of growth and investment in job creation and opportunities is one I could support strongly in principle.  That does not change the treaty, but an addition focused on growth and investment, depending on the issues involved, is one I could support.  Clearly, we have already made known our views on the issues of corporation tax rates and a financial transaction tax.  I accept there is a principle involved.  I support leaders who join in placing the focus on the need to have investment and growth included in the agenda, but it is not for me to interfere with the statements made by Mr. Hollande, President Sarkozy or anyone else who is conducting his or her own electoral process.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The point I make is that it is not in the treaty and Mr. Hollande wants it to be.  The Government is now campaigning for a treaty which may not be relevant in a few weeks time if Mr. Hollande and other leaders get their way.  Does the Taoiseach realise that it might be better to defer the referendum, as other nations are deferring ratification in anticipation of or as a precaution against this happening.  Otherwise, I suspect we will be jumping the gun.The issue of growth is possibly more important to this country than to any other nation in Europe.  It is even more important now - I remind the Taoiseach that last Friday the Department of Finance finally, after many months of delay, decided to downgrade the growth forecast for the nation from 1.3%, on which it and the Government had stood for many months when nobody else believed it, to 0.7%.  The issue of growth is even more important now because the figure is lower and the Department's forecast is lower than 1.3%, the figure on which the budget was based in December.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I remind the Deputy that the Minister for Finance always pointed out that there would be a review of the growth figures as set out.  As the Deputy is well aware, these matters are subject to a range of criteria before being finalised.  It is also a fact that growth has returned to the economy for the first time in a number of years.  The figures for the live register and the Exchequer returns in recent months show a measure of confidence which is heading in the right direction.  I will not go as far as others have in the past, but the level of growth is heading in the right direction, despite the scale of the challenges that we face.  I agree with the Deputy that growth is absolutely fundamental to what we have to do.  That is why the plan set out by the Government and the projections set out by the Minister for Finance are based on growth, opportunity and investment.I am sure the Deputy has read the stability treaty on many occasions,  Article 1 of which aims to strengthen the co-ordination of economic policies and improve the governance of the euro area, thereby supporting the achievement of the European Union's objectives for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  That is what the stability treaty is about and the reason the opportunity will present itself on 31 May for the people of the country to make a decision on which road they want to take.  A "Yes" vote is one that will offer stability, permanence, guaranteed access to funding, opportunity, investment and jobs.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	145	A "No" vote will undermine confidence, cause confusion and be a step into the unknown for many.  I do not want the people to make that decision.  I want them to send a message of confidence, courage and belief in the eurozone but, more importantly, in the country that the stream of investments will not be damaged in any way and that as a consequence, the best way of dealing with the deficit is to have growth.  In order to have growth one must have jobs; in order to have jobs one must have confidence; in order to have confidence one must have investors to make decisions.  They are making these decisions week by week, as is perfectly evident to everyone and I do not wish to see this damaged in any way.  That is why I urge the people on 31 May to freely acquaint themselves with what the treaty is about.  It is about achieving sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  I am sure everyone, irrespective of his or her political affiliations, can understand this is important for the people and our children.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The modern languages in primary schools initiative had been a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools and had operated since 1998.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's recommendation that for the present modern languages not be part of the primary school curriculum as an additional and separate subject was accepted by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The primary curriculum is being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  The €2.5 million in savings from this measure will go towards meeting the cost of implementing the new national literacy and numeracy strategy.  The Blue Star programme has to be seen in the context of the Government's commitment to building public understanding and knowledge about Ireland's EU membership.  In support of this objective, my Department administers funds for the purposes o thef Communicating Europe initiative.  This covers a number of activities, some ongoing and some new this year, including grants provided under the Communicating Europe initiative, the Blue Star programme, activities centred around Europe Week and a number of pre-Presidency events such as those planned by the Institute for International and European Affairs and NUI Maynooth.The Blue Star programme for primary schools was put out to competitive tender on a pilot basis last year.  The most economically advantageous tender was received from European Movement Ireland, EMI, for €39,785, excluding VAT.  Accordingly, the contract to manage the programme was awarded to EMI.  Payments totalling €27,849 were made last year by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, when the Communicating Europe initiative fell within its budget.  Provision has been made in my Department's Estimate for this year for the balance of funding required for the pilot programme, €11,936.I welcome the new programme for primary schools, the aim of which is to foste rthrough classroom projects and activities better understanding and knowledge of how the European Union affects our lives.  The Blue Star programme will introduce participants - pupils, teachers, parents and the wider community - to the European Union, what it means and how it works.  Participating schools will complete four modules on historical, geographical, cultural and creative and institutional issues relating to the European Union before the end of the current academic year.  More than 90 primary schools made initial inquiries, of which 34 have signed up to undertake the programme.  This shows a healthy level of interest on the part of schools in this EU education programme.  All schools that successfully complete the programme will be awarded an EU flag and a Blue Star.  This is a pilot programme which will be evaluated later this summer and, depending on its outcome, consideration will be given to its further operation in the next academic year.Deputy Michéal Martin asked about public engagement.  Funds available for Communicating Europe support the provision of grants under the Communicating Europe initiative.  This annual programme provides funding for voluntary organisations, education bodies and civil society groups for projects aimed at deepening public awareness of the role that the European Union plays in our daily lives.  Funds amounting to €46,000 were recently approved to 19 applicants.  These covered Europe Day events, education and academic projects, cultural initiatives as well as national civil society and media projects.My Department is also planning a number of cultural and other public activities to be held in Dublin centred on Europe Day this year.  A programme of EU related events is also being planned in the Oireachtas and will be announced shortly.As the House will be aware, the referendum on the stability treaty will take place on 31 May.  To help the public to make an informed decision on that date, a comprehensive information campaign has been launched.  This includes a 40-page treaty guide, in Irish and English, and a second information leaflet being delivered to every household in the country, along with a dedicated website - www.stabilitytreaty.ie - and media campaign.  I look forward to an engaging and balanced debate over the coming weeks.This is a particularly intense period of EU-related activity for Ireland.  In addition to the referendum campaign, preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers is intensifying.  Work is underway to develop a media and communications strategy relating to Ireland's role in the EU and to develop an initial communications plan for Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers.As I said at the outset, the Government is committed to building public understanding and knowledge about Ireland's EU membership.  The various initiatives, which I have outlined, are central to these endeavours.Finally, Deputy Martin also asked about the EU matters website.  As he is aware, this was developed by the then Department of Foreign Affairs.  Following the transfer of the co-ordination of European Union affairs from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to my Department, we are considering how the Government's approach to EU issues can best be communicated to the public.  The EU matters website has been taken down and links to it removed pending the outcome of this review.Information on EU business is, of course, contained on my Department's website at www.taoiseach.gov.ie, on the Government’s news service www.merrionstreet.ie and on the websites of all Departments.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.It is incredible, if I heard correctly, that it has been adjudicated by the Government that modern languages should not be part of the primary school curriculum.  It was I who, in 1998-99, as Minister for Education, introduced the pilot programme for modern languages to introduce Spanish, French, German and Italian to primary schools.  Since then, over 450 schools have participated annually in the cost-effective programme that has made an appreciable impact on primary school-going children enjoying and learning modern European languages.  In the context of a country that wants to embrace our membership of the European Union and that wants to broaden horizons, it is incredible that the funding has been taken from that programme, that the programme is being stopped and the funding is being put into an alternative programme to do with general literacy.  It is not good enough to shut down some programmes and then be photographed opening up new programmes with the same funding.In essence, it is extraordinary that a good and worthwhile initiative has been shelved by the Government in the context of the current serious engagement with the European Union in the form of the referendum.  Over the past decade thousands of school children have benefited from this programme.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider that decision and to ensure the continuation of that programme.  In the overall scheme of things, it is affordable.Second, on the Blue Star initiative and www.eumatters.ie, it is difficult to comprehend how a specific website set up to inform the public generally about European Union matters, which we initiated when I was in the Department for Foreign Affairs because of a sense a number of years ago after the Lisbon referendum that the public needed to be informed more about Europe generally, and which was part of a wider information programme to provide information to the public on Europe, was collapsed, as the Taoiseach seemed to state in his reply, because of the EU foreign policy unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade being transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach.  In the lead-up to a referendum campaign, this is a retrograde step.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	148	A question, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Is it good enough that important pillars that we have put in place to provide broad information on Europe should be collapsed simply because of bureaucratic issues between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Taoiseach, or can the Taoiseach clarity further why, in the current context, an important avenue of providing information was shut down?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Modern languages are of enormous importance as we move on in a global world.  I hear people commenting on the necessity to learn new languages such as Chinese, Russian, Portuguese and Arabic because of the changing nature of the global economies.This recommendation was made by the national council dealing with the curriculum.  They recommended that, for the present, modern languages should not be part, as an additional and separate subject, of the primary school curriculum.  They stressed "for the present".  The €2.5 million that was allocated for that, which, as Deputy Martin stated, he started off in 1998, was reallocated to dealing with the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is important as well for children who are challenged in that particular area.  It is not an issue that is finalised for good.  They specifically stated it is "for the present", while this matter is being reviewed.The EU matters website, as I understand it, was launched in 2009 after the Lisbon treaty referendum.  The information that was on that site was certainly relevant when it was set up, but it was never systematically reviewed and is now largely historical in nature.  While the section dealing with European Union affairs has transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of the Taoiseach, that link was taken down.  It is now being reviewed, both in the context of relevant information but also to look at the question of whether one should expand this with the other social interactions such as Facebook and Twitter which have been incorporated into the stabilitytreaty.ie website.  That matter is under active review by the Department and I expect it to make a decision on this fairly soon.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Could the Taoiseach clarify what he means by the modern languages programme being reviewed?  We export primarily to European Union countries.  For example, Germany is our biggest market for pork and France is the biggest market for Irish seafood.  It is important that there is capacity built up in society in European languages.  All educators accept that the earlier one gets engaged with a subject the better, particularly in preschool and primary school.  The earlier we introduce children to languages, the better the prospect of having ever greater numbers capable and competent in those languages by the time they come out of third level.  Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are looking for persons versed in these languages, who can speak them competently, with a view to advancing the sale of Irish products and services, and also winning investment into the country.It defies logic that one would end the programme summarily as the Government has done.  It makes no logical sense whatsoever for us, as an outgoing global economy and society that wants to cherish a global dynamic in terms of our engagement with the wider world.  I ask the Taoiseach to review that Government decision.  The NCCA can recommend various actions.  We need not accept them all of the time.  This programme was doing well for ten years and the evaluations of the programme were positive.It would be a different matter if the professional evaluations of the programme were negative and indicated it had no impact, but they were, in fact, very positive.  Now is the time to double up on our engagement with modern European languages and to include other languages such as Mandarin.  I fully subscribe to that.My final question relates to the website, www.eumatters.ie.  The Taoiseach is correct in saying it was established after the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the reason being to create a permanent infrastructure for the Government, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular, to communicate European matters to citizens.  These matters were not only to do with treaties but also non-treaty issues - the general activity that happens at European level.  It was born out of a perception, based on EU barometers over time, that citizens were becoming alienated from Europe or less engaged with it as a result of such issues as telephone roaming charges, agricultural practices or whatever and that there was an ongoing need to provide information on what was happening in the EU.  If Departments are falling down in systematically inputting this type of information, that is an administrative issue that must be corrected, resourced and enhanced.  Simply closing the website is not the correct answer.  We are seeing the negative dividends of this day by day in terms of people’s interactions with and understanding of Europe and where it is heading into the future.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am a major supporter of modern languages.  The Deputy is correct that some organisations would say young people who qualify in three languages or more at university deserve special treatment in the sense there will always be opportunities for them.  When I meet representatives of multinationals, especially where call offices are involved and some of which are seeking to employ groups of 300 or 400, there is always a demand for languages.  The children of this country are as capable of learning multilinguistic functions and sounds as are any other children.  It is a given that children are always challenged by new sounds, words and ways of communicating.  The Minister for Education and Skills made his decision regarding the modern languages initiative, for the present, on the basis of the recommendation by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to that effect.  I have had many interactions with Deputy Martin, both as Gaeilge and as Béarla, about the way we teach our native language and how, because of particular difficulties or factors, many of our children cannot speak it after 12, 13 or 14 years.  There are issues with teaching methods, teacher training and communication facilities.  It is very easy to teach modern languages, however, and the methods involved have changed to an extraordinary degree in recent years.  The Deputy will have heard over the years of people, 60 or 70 years ago, being able to communicate in Greek, for example, because of the presence of a particular teacher.I will speak to the Minister for Education and Skills, who also has a clear interest in modern languages and communications, about the issue.  As I said, it was a recommendation of the NCCA that the current situation be adopted for the present.  The money that was formerly allocated for this purpose was put into the literacy and numeracy strategy.  I give a guarantee to the House that I will review the matter.  Some would argue the primary school curriculum is overloaded.  I have spoken to junior certificate mathematics teachers whose pupils have difficulty with the basics of addition, subtraction, division and so on.  It is a question of identifying priorities in the primary school system and deciding where modern languages fit into it.  As I said, I am a supporter of modern languages.  It is wonderful for young people, in a global situation that has changed utterly, to be able to travel and communicate freely.  I was in Galway yesterday where Cisco is making a €26 million investment.  Its capacity to communicate high definition data globally in real time is quite incredible.  Most of the larger companies use the software that is designed for that purpose, and multilingual skills are vital in that regard.In regard to the EU matters website, it was a good initiative but, unfortunately, it was not updated regularly.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates its own website in respect of international matters, while European matters are now handled through the European section of the Department of the Taoiseach.  I have spoken to staff in that section about the importance of it being a vibrant, energetic, communicating website which deals not just with this treaty, as the Deputy observed, but with all the functions of the European Union - how it works and what it means for citizens - and provides access to information on all the relevant facilities of the Union.  By enabling people to be properly engaged and to find information in a straightforward fashion, it will give them an understanding of what it is to be part of Europe.  I will let the House know as progress is made on getting the website up and running.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Questions Nos. 1 and 2 are in the name of my colleague, Deputy Seán Crowe, the Sinn Féin spokesman on education.  These questions were put to the Minister for Education and Skills but, for some reason that is beyond me, they were transferred to the Taoiseach.  The reason Deputy Crowe tabled these questions is that he is concerned by the budget announcement of the ending of the modern languages initiative in primary schools.  I entirely accept the Taoiseach's statement that he is very much in favour of modern languages.  It struck me as I was preparing for this session that just last week we discussed in this House the importance of building trade links.  Good work is being done in regard to China and, potentially, other parts of the world, including Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia.  We are constantly discussing the importance of learning modern languages.  Of the 1,000 jobs to be created by PayPal in Dundalk - a very welcome announcement - 50% will require applicants to have a working knowledge of an additional language.In this context, setting aside the modern languages initiative makes no sense.  Some 545 schools participated in the scheme, with pupils developing a very positive attitude towards language learning.  The decision to cease funding for the initiative in the last budget was a retrograde step.  France is our fifth largest trading partner, for instance, yet we are closing the opportunity for young people to learn French, as well as German, Spanish, Italian and Mandarin.  I was with a delegation last week, one member of which was asked whether he had a working knowledge of Arabic.  The Taoiseach knows better than I that in our globalised world it is no longer the exception but a necessity that people should have language skills.I welcome the Taoiseach's indication this decision will be reviewed, but why was it taken in the first place?  There is no suggestion the initiative was not successful and it is clearly a vital part of our efforts to come out of recession.  What is the justification for introducing a new pilot scheme when what is in place is working?  Although the Taoiseach has given a full answer, I ask him to indicate why a scheme that was working was terminated and replaced by something which seems, with all respect to the Blue Star programme, to be simply giving up on the opportunity for young people to learn modern languages.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The reason Deputy Crowe's questions came to me is they included a reference to the Blue Star programme.  That programme is not meant to be a replacement for the pilot initiative for language learning.  It is run by the Department of the Taoiseach, with very small funding I should say, with the aim of increasing awareness in schools of diversity and of what the European Union is, what it means, how it works and so on.  It is not meant to be a pilot language scheme although, clearly, when we speak of different countries, there are connections with the language there.  Deputy Crowe might wish to put down a specific question to the Minister for Education and Skills or to raise this as a topical issue.I am interested in this area because it is an opportunity for real investment and real jobs.  Speaking to the chief executive of PayPal, an extraordinary company, there are clearly opportunities for new languages and some old European languages.  In such an industry, which is going to Dundalk, fluency in the language is a major issue, not just capacity to communicate but fluency to deal with issues that arise with products.  From my experience, for those who learn a language, the extra edge of fluency is always obtained by undertaking a programme in the country in question.  That is often the key to employment in companies like PayPal.  People might be able to communicate and understand each other but fluency makes the difference between being able to market and sell and drive forward.  That does not get away from the basic point that Irish children are as capable of learning four or five languages as any other children and they have proven that time and again - the children of diplomats or those who have occasion to move because their families are involved in business.I will speak to the Minister for Education and Skills as we move along with this and review the position.  If Deputies put down a question about the reasons why the National Council for Curriculum Assessment made its recommendation, the Minister will give a detailed response.

Perhaps the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will write that down as well.  Everything the Taoiseach says, however, highlights how short-sighted it is to end the modern language initiative.  Everything he says would act to encourage such initiatives as opposed to ending them.  It would be illuminating if the Taoiseach could tell us why this scheme was ended.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 38, inclusive, together.I travelled to Berlin on Thursday, 23 February, for an informal working dinner with Chancellor Merkel.  Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis of Latvia and Prime Minister Petr Necas of the Czech Republic also attended the dinner.  Discussions focused on the future of Europe; how we could move beyond the current crisis; and how we could ensure that we can avoid crises in the future.  Our informal meeting was extremely engaging and conducted in a most positive and constructive atmosphere.  There was a shared determination to focus on the steps needed to encourage growth and job creation in the Union.I took the opportunity to brief my German, Latvian and Czech colleagues on developments in Ireland, and the preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the Council which will commence in eight months time.  I outlined to my colleagues that the Irish recovery is proceeding well, but that we need the continuing support of partners.  With regard to wider eurozone issues, we agreed that the deal reached by Finance Ministers on Greece on 20 February was an important one but I stressed that we still need firewalls and a strong focus on growth if we are to overcome the crisis.In relation to our forthcoming Presidency during the first half of 2013, I indicated that we would be pressing ahead with jobs and growth at the heart of the agenda.  The next round of the European Semester will take place during our term, and we will work to ensure that every effort to foster growth is central to the European Semester process.  We did not discuss arrangements for ratification of the stability treaty during this informal meeting.Following my meeting in Berlin, I travelled to Rome on Friday, 24 February for a meeting with Prime Minister Monti.  Our discussions focused on eurozone issues, preparations for the spring European Council, the jobs and growth agenda and the Single Market.  Both Italy and Ireland are working hard to get their economies back on to a sustainable footing and the Prime Minister and I agreed that while discipline is essential, recovery will not come without growth.  We also agreed that while we are making great efforts to recover, robust firewalls were also necessary.I attended the spring meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 1-2 March.  As I have already made a statement to the House concerning this meeting, I will merely set out a summary of its proceedings.Discussions at the spring European Council focused on economic policy.  That meeting marked the end of the first phase of the European semester.  The European Council discussed budgetary and economic strategies to stimulate growth and increase competitiveness across Europe.  In this regard, we endorsed the five priorities for 2012 set out in the European Commission's annual growth survey, including actions to be taken at national level and action required at EU level.  I cosigned a further letter on the growth agenda ahead of the meeting, this time supported by 12 member states.  We called for progress in eight specific areas, and are broadly satisfied with how these issues are reflected in the Conclusions.  They will remain a key focus over the period ahead.As the House will be aware, there is now a shared view around the European Council table that to enhance prospects for economic recovery in Europe, we also need to generate real momentum aimed towards the creation of jobs and growth.  These are the issues that matter most to the people of Europe.  The Commission's growth forecast served as a reminder of this.  With decisive and coordinated action, we can work together to underpin stability and boost growth and jobs.The European Council also set the EU's priorities for the forthcoming G8 and G20 Summits, as well as for the Rio +20 Summit in June.  In the field of foreign policy, the meeting took stock of the evolving situation in Syria as well as developments concerning the Arab spring and set guidance for further EU support to that process.  Ireland fully supports this process.  In addition, the 27 Heads of State and Government endorsed the granting of the status of candidate country to Serbia.Finally, the European Council elected Herman Van Rompuy President of the European Council for a second mandate of two and a half years.  Eurozone leaders also designated him as the first President of the Euro Summit.In the margins of the European Council on 2 March, I signed, on behalf of Ireland, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  The treaty is, of course, subject to ratification by the Irish people in the referendum to take place on 31 May.  While I had no formal bilateral meetings at the European Council, I did of course see a number of my colleagues during the course of the meeting.  The issues of inflation risk and the situation in Egypt did not arise at this meeting of the European Council.The announcement at the end of March on promissory notes and bank debt is another good step in our ongoing efforts to improve our programme.  The use of an Irish Government bond for the promissory note payment allows the wider discussions on the Irish debt associated with the recapitalisation of the banks to continue and hopefully come to a successful outcome that is in our interests.On my travel plans for the remainder of 2012, I will attend the scheduled meetings of the European Council on 28 -29 June, 18-19 October and 13-14 December.  I will also attend the British Irish Council on 22 June.  I will of course keep my plans for travel and visits under careful review, particularly as our Presidency approaches.I have had no formal bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain or Prime Minister Coelho of Portugal, however, I will see both leaders at the next scheduled meeting of the European Council next month.Relations with the European Central Bank are the responsibility of the Minister for Finance in the first instance, however, and I have had no contact with the President of the European Central Bank other than in the context of meetings of the European Council.I have not yet received an agenda for the June European Council.  The annotated draft agenda is expected to be received during the third week of May.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, which dealt with Questions Nos. 5 to 38, inclusive, 34 in total.  I do not believe this is a satisfactory way to proceed.  If the old system whereby questions to the Taoiseach were taken twice a week, as was the case at the beginning of the lifetime of this Dáil, were still in operation, we would have had a better chance of dealing with some of the 34 questions to which I refer.  A number of these relate to meetings which took place as long ago as 1 and 2 March.  The Taoiseach took on the Herculean task of dealing with that number of questions in one go.  It is a formidable task by any standards.When this number of questions are taken together, many issues are going to be passed over.  In that context, I refer the Taoiseach to Question No. 28, with which he did not deal in his reply and which asked if he would detail any documents relating to bank related debt which he circulated to other Heads of State or Government who attended the European Council.  In the context of his response to Question No. 29 and in view of the significant issues around the promissory note, including the commitments made in respect of it and the severity and gravity of the situation in which this country finds itself, I find it incredible that the Taoiseach has not met the President of the European Central Bank.  What occurred at the end of March was not a serious development but was, rather, a camouflaged kicking of the can down the road, and it was widely reported as such.On the broader issues to which these questions relate, I stated previously that I would have preferred the referendum to be held in late June.  I have always been of the view that holding it at the end of this month would heighten the risks to its being passed, especially in light of the occurrence of a range of events across Europe.  In France, for example, Francois Hollande is demanding that extra measures be agreed by European Union leaders before he will agree, if elected, to ratify the stability treaty.  I accept that there is at long last a growing convergence of opinion in respect of the need for strong growth in parallel with moves to balance budgets.  There is also agreement on the need for a stimulus programme at pan-European level.  The Tánaiste has indicated that the existing growth agenda would address Francois Hollande's concerns.  I do not accept that because I am of the view more is required.  I would accept the treaty does not prevent other actions being taken.  The more honest approach would be to show the people the larger agenda that exists in respect of this matter, namely, that the fiscal treaty is a stepping stone towards further moves which will ensure Europe and Ireland will emerge from the current crisis.  The basic point is that while the treaty is needed, it is not enough in itself.  We should be upfront and honest in respect of that matter.I have consistently stated during the past year that further treaty changes will be required, particularly in the context of the mandate of the European Central Bank and the role it has played in the current crisis.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that matter?  Does he accept there will be a requirement for further treaty changes in the future to ensure the mandate of the European Central Bank will be broadened and a genuine fiscal union, which will allow real transfers across borders in the event that certain countries get into difficulties, will be created?  If we show the people there is a broader agenda at play and this can assist us in emerging from the crisis, they will support both the treaty and broader growth policies within Europe.On bank debt, it appears what is being sought is for the ESM to fund our debt.  This will not address the debt sustainability issue which has surfaced.  Are we no longer seeking an explicit write-down in respect of the promissory note debt?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I met the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi, upon his appointment and after Mr. Trichet had vacated the position.  I did not have a formal meeting with him.  The Minister for Finance travelled to Frankfurt to meet Mr. Draghi and has met him on a number of occasions since his appointment.  A briefing document in respect of the promissory note was circulated by the European Union section of my Department to our counterparts throughout Europe.As I informed Deputy Ross in respect of an earlier question, the treaty is about sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  It is not for me to interfere in the electoral processes of France or any other country.  We made a clear decision, in adequate time, to hold the referendum on 31 May next.  Irrespective of when one holds a referendum, there will always be events which can discussed in the context of whether they will assist the process.  This is a matter for the Irish people to make a decision on and we are well able to make up our own minds in respect of the question being asked.  That question is whether people will give their authorisation for the ratification of the treaty, which relates to growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  I hope the people will answer "Yes", especially on the basis of the evidence before them in respect of continued strong investment.  Such investment leads to job opportunities and helps to create growth, which in turn reduces our debt and makes it easier for us to reach the point at which we can once again fly on our own economically.  The less money we are obliged to spend on debt and interest payments, the more will be available to spend in areas such as health, education and so on where a clear need exists.As Deputy Martin is aware, there has been some movement in respect of the European situation.  The meetings of the European Council I attended from March of last year up to recently were all consumed by talk of catastrophe, default, the break-up of the eurozone, the demise of the euro, the removal or potential removal of countries from the eurozone, etc.  The position has now changed.  Greece was the subject of headlines on the front pages of world newspapers for two and a half years but we have moved to the point where there is a recognition that if one wants to put one's house in order, one will be obliged to engage in some good housekeeping.  On its own, the agenda in this regard does not deal with the challenge of creating growth and opportunity.There has been a recognition of the role of the European Central Bank.  Deputy Martin is well aware of the exceptional liquidity released by Mr. Draghi and the bank into the system to relieve the pressure on it.  There has also been a recognition of the urgency of this matter by means of the bringing forward of the establishment of the ESM by 12 months.  There is also the issue of the adequacy and the scale of the firewalls being made available.  We must remember the co-operation offered by the IMF when Europe was prepared to put its money where its mouth is.  Clearly the firewall available will be of a scale which will allow it to prevent contagion.  This type of action speaks for itself.The question of the promissory notes is one with which the Minister for Finance and his counterparts are actively involved.  That will continue to be the case.  Issues such as the future role of the European Central Bank, the question of eurobonds, etc. have not yet become the subject of specific proposals.  The Deputy is aware that what Ireland would like in this regard is an opportunity to have a longer spell at a lower interest rate because this would assist us with our deficit and debt repayments.  The Minister for Finance will continue to negotiate on behalf of the country in respect of these matters.  When they are finally dealt with at European Council level, we will make decisions that are in the best interests of the country.  While there has been some movement and a degree of recognition of the need for change, I am of the view that developments will accelerate once the stability treaty is ratified by 12 countries and proceeds to be implemented.The agenda being discussed by Mr. Hollande, if he is to be elected by the French people, is one of additional growth.  I welcome the statements from European leaders in respect of a focus on an agenda which promotes investment, growth, jobs and opportunities.  We fully support that principle which we, as a country, have been advocating for some months.  What the French people decide to do is their business.I want the Deputy to understand that while the treaty has been signed, it does not prevent additional measures being inserted that will not alter the treaty but will add a particular focus to it such as jobs and investment.  That could be in the same way the European Parliament voted through a range of protocols given to Ireland arising from the Lisbon treaty with particular reference to corporation tax rates and so on.  I would not give a carte blanche, as they say in France, to growth and investment because we have objections to financial transaction taxes and any changes in corporation tax rates that might be of interest to other countries.  We would see this as a growth issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I am not clear about this.  Are we seeking an explicit write-down of the promissory note debt?  Will the Taoiseach clarify our position on this?  Regarding the growth agenda, I accept there is more talk around growth and development.  I accept in election campaigns people will make comments.  If the French socialist leader gets elected, the one aspect of the treaty he will not change is the link to the ESM, European Stability Mechanism.  A fundamental raison d’être for supporting the treaty is the guaranteed secure access to this funding.  No matter who gets elected, that will not change anytime soon.  We need to be upfront and clear with people on that.  What may change is a focus on a more concrete growth agenda, which I would support.Where is the beef in all of this?  To put flesh on the bone, an early manifestation of this change could be at the negotiations of the European budget, for example.  The Commission is proposing an increase of 7%.  This would be a test for Germany and other states as to the degree to which they want to create additional spend across the European Union economy.  That is a move we should support at a broader European level.  The talks on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy over time will be another important signal in terms of support of measures that can help member states' domestic economies, especially our own.  Whereas Greece may have receded temporarily from the headlines, unfortunately others have come in to fill the space.  There is considerable speculation and concern, as we know, about Spain.  That is why some of the questions tabled today asked if the Taoiseach met the Spanish Prime Minister recently.  That is another reason we should opt for security and vote for the treaty because we are not out of the eurozone crisis yet.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Thank you, Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	168	We should not pretend we are out of the eurozone crisis.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that dimension?  We are still in a relatively volatile and uncertain scenario.  We need to identify clearly the concrete steps we can take to put the country on a more secure pathway rather than the alternative uncertain scenario in the event of the treaty not being passed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	169	With regard to the Greek private sector initiative, PSI, it was made perfectly clear by the European Council that this applied to Greece only.  It is not a case of looking for write-downs here but one of looking for a re-engineering of the promissory note system to bring about a longer repayment period and lower interest rates which will make it easier for Ireland to deal with its deficit and pay its debts.The Deputy is correct that the eurozone is not out of the woods.  It is in a fragile position and great concern has been expressed about Spain, given the size of the country's economy and its unemployment rates.  Earlier this was reflected in the great anxiety about Italy when the new Prime Minister, Mr. Monti, was appointed.  Obviously, decisions were taken by his Government on how to deal with the structural challenges there.  Likewise, the Spanish Prime Minister, on taking up office, examined the situation, and some revisions in respect of Spain's targets were put in place.It is true to say the eurozone is not by any means out of this particular challenge.  Deputy Martin is correct that the road to travel here is the one of certainty and guarantee of access to a permanent funding mechanism, were that ever to be required.  When the treaty is ratified and moves on, the question of the future role of the European Central Bank, eurobonds and these other issues will become the focus of attention and proposal.  If we cannot understand that, like every household in the country, we must live within our means, then there is a problem.  That is the problem many countries have now which is why we have this enormous frustration at European Council meetings about decisions being taken that people, in some cases, knew in their hearts were never going to be followed through.The question of organising this in a way that countries can have a clear target to get their houses in order while, parallel to that, having a specific growth agenda where investment and opportunity can take place is something I strongly support.  Article 1 of the treaty, dealing with sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion, can be fleshed out.  This agenda was taken up anyway with the small and medium-sized enterprises part of the recent European Council summit.  The question of a youth unemployment rate above the 29% European average, which also includes Ireland, was addressed.  There are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union.  At the same time, there are 23 million people unemployed.  In theory, if each enterprise could take on one person, then the problem would be dealt with.  However, that is not reality.It has taken some time to force the growth agenda onto the overall agenda.  It can be developed as a larger platform which, as Deputy Martin said, provides certainty, a guarantee for the future and an opportunity for every country to develop their economies for the benefit of their people, workers, jobs and opportunities.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	172	On the issue of the promissory note, the Minister for Finance raised all sorts of expectations but then came up with something that does not reduce our debt, deficit or the State's liability to Anglo Irish Bank.  In fact, we now have to find an additional €90 million in taxes and cuts this year because of the increase in the debt.  That is a bit of wizardry, revisionism and spin.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	174	The Taoiseach knows this is not a treaty about sustainable growth or social inclusion.  The Taoiseach should step out of Leinster House and look at what is happening around us.  There are 500,000 people unemployed, thousands forced to emigrate and social guarantees reduced every day.  This morning the Minister for Finance - the Minister of hardship - was at it again frightening people with no positive argument being put forward in favour of this treaty.  It is all scary stuff trying to frighten people.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The clear message is that austerity is not working.  In 2008, the Exchequer deficit was €12.78 billion; in 2011, €24.9 billion.  After five austerity budgets and €24 billion in cuts, along with a whole host of new charges such as the household tax, the septic tank tax, property tax, water charges, massive cuts to education and other social guarantees, particularity the outrageous cut of some 500,000 hours of home help for people in the community, it is clear austerity is not working.In the past 12 months the Labour Party and Fine Gael have given €21 billion to the banks.  Where is the job stimulus project and the Government's proposal and funding for getting people off the dole and regenerating the economy?  Sinn Féin is very clear about this.  We believe the deficit must be reduced and put forward propositions to do this which were socially equitable compared to what is happening now.  Waste must be cut.  We part company from the Government and Fianna Fáil - as they are the parties of cosy consensus - in the idea that we can cut our way out of recession.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  The Government has not brought forward any jobs stimulus project that is clearly funded.  Numerous constructed and costed propositions have been ignored by the Government.Does the Taoiseach agree that austerity is the problem rather than the answer?  Will he look into his soul and appreciate that the only safe and sound answer in this referendum is to vote "No"?  It is the only safe way to go forward with any possibility that we will get back to redeveloping our economy, getting our people back to work and building our public services.  The Government is looking to give away what remains of autonomy, sovereignty and democratic rights.  People can choose whether to re-elect the Government at the next election but if it brings in the European Commission and the European Court of Justice to police matters, we will not be able to vote them in or out.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is absolute nonsense to suggest that in some way Fine Gael has discovered the panacea for our ills and is promoting growth?  In reality, it is cutting repeatedly and increasing taxes.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Germany's Chancellor Merkel has injected her obsession with debts and deficits into the fiscal treaty.  The Taoiseach might listen to the question so he is able to answer it.  When he met Chancellor Merkel, did he mention the significant grievance among people in this country because a very substantial part of our inflated debt results from the activities of German and other European banks which lent recklessly to banks in this country speculating in the Irish property market?  It also came from European Central Bank policy of essentially printing cheap money to benefit Germany at that time.  Therefore, ordinary people have a significant grievance because they are being asked to pick up 100% of the tab for the gambling of European banks.  If she wanted any hope of getting this treaty through, Chancellor Merkel might have considered writing down debts which have been forced on the people of this country as a result of the speculation of bankers and bondholders, particularly German banks.The Taoiseach stated at the summit where he signed the fiscal treaty, and has repeated here since, that there is now great concern for growth.  It is mentioned in the treaty that we need growth and investment.  Will the Taoiseach explain why the only concrete target in the treaty requires austerity and cuts to meet the deficit and debt targets in the vast majority of European countries if implemented, but there are no specific figures or measures proposed for growth?  What were the discussions about growth, other than simply mentioning the word 28 times in the communiqué at the March summit?  The Taoiseach has mentioned it a dozen or so times here.  What specific measures are proposed for growth?Regardless of our views on economics, we all accept that the only way to get growth and jobs is through investment and demand in the economy.  In other words, in order to have growth and investment, people must have money in their pockets to buy goods, and the people who have the money - primarily the banks now - must invest that money in the economy.  Neither of those is happening and the ingredients of the fiscal treaty are moving precisely in the opposite direction.  Two months after the summit where the Taoiseach signed the treaty with Chancellor Merkel, are they not feeling a little lonely and forlorn in Europe, as they seem to be the only people still promoting this treaty unconditionally?  Everybody else in Europe is seeking concrete measures to stimulate the economy, create jobs and get investment.  Every set of statistics published week on week shows that the austerity agenda is crippling growth in the economy and leading to increases in unemployment.  Why are the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel virtually alone in saying we should pass this treaty without serious amendment at the very least?I also asked a question about Egypt.  The Taoiseach mentioned that he discussed the Arab spring and there is a very serious repression of democracy activists and independent trade unions ongoing in Egypt now that the spotlight has gone from the country.  Is that being discussed?  There are, essentially, attempts to crush the Arab spring and the democratic revolution in Egypt but what are European leaders doing and saying about safeguarding the democratic gains of the Egyptian revolution?

It goes directly to Dundalk in the case of PayPal recruiting for 1,000 jobs.  I assume the Deputy does not find that bizarre.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I welcome that.  I was talking about the attempt to revise recent history.

That is what we are at with the likes of Apple, Mylan, Allergan, PayPal or any of the other companies.  The Minister responsible for jobs is in the United States now speaking to representatives of 20 companies about continued investment here and I assume the Deputy does not find that bizarre.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	185	If the Deputy finds this bizarre and in some way incongruous that people outside our country should look at what we do and offer before investing not just in Ireland but in the Deputy's location in Dundalk, it speaks to what he is at here.The Deputy mentioned the promissory note that was dealt with by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  Deputy Adams seemed quite disappointed that we got a result - as the manager of the Irish football team said at one time - on the first tranche of the payment.  He raised the issue for two months before it became a reality and when it was finally accepted that something should be done, the Deputy was a little upset.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Not in the least.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	187	He would have loved to have been on the steps of the Four Courts with lawyers brandishing sheaves of paper about the inability of the Government to make any progress.  The Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, will continue the discussions about the remainder of the promissory notes involved.I agree that the legacy of people unemployed in this country is much too high.  The live register figures speak for themselves and are encouraging in respect of confidence returning.  The Minister for Social Protection will deal with that issue later this afternoon.  Of the more than 400,000 on the live register, the Deputy will be aware that significant numbers are working part time and that others who sign on for credits are not seeking work.  A restructuring and clarification of the make-up of the register should be looked at, but that does not deal with the fact that far too many are unemployed.  The reason the Government has set its face towards promoting business and opening doors to it is that it is part of the stimulus process in which we are involved.  The Deputy will be aware of the Pathways to Work scheme introduced by the Minister for Social Protection and the JobBridge initiative, a fabulously successful scheme with more than 5,000 people working through it.  He will also be aware of the Government using the National Pension Reserve Fund for loans in respect of significant engineering projects and infrastructural development which is important in the creation of jobs and the new attitude of the Department of Finance to be progressive in looking for further opportunities for investment from abroad, be it from pension funds or the European Investment Bank.  This issue is under active consideration.We are not satisfied with the extent of unemployment and want to take every opportunity to stimulate the indigenous economy.  That is why in replying to Deputy Michéal Martin earlier I referred to mortgage interest relief, the reduction in stamp duty, the non-application of capital gains tax on commercial property after seven years and face to face discussions with the banks to get moving on the release of money, in respect of which they have been recapitalised for investment and loans.  That is all part of the jobs agenda.As Deputy Gerry Adams will also be aware, we published, with monitoring by my Department, the first quarterly report on the jobs action programme.  It has 270 propositions to deal with in opening doors for businesses, in dealing with red tape, taxation issues, opportunities and incentives for employers to take on young people and in terms of how to get the message out that the country is open for business.  That is part of the bigger picture because the next wave of investment will be for smaller enterprises which can meet the requirements and service needs of major companies which continue to invest here.  I will repeat until the Deputy is sick of it that the tax system, the technology and the talent we have available and the track record of what we offer in this country are second to none and I do not want to see them damaged in any way.  That is why, from that point of view, I hope the people will endorse the treaty strongly when they come to make that choice.In response to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, we discussed the question of the grievances of the people in the context of the challenge and enormous burden placed upon them in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The German Chancellor is well aware of the scale of that challenge and anxious to help in every way possible.  Even if we never had a fiscal stability treaty, we would have to put our own house in order.  That is a fact of life people all over the country recognise.  We are spending €16 billion more than we are taking in.  I do not know whether people in the Deputy's cohorts who were in Galway or other places are prepared to write a cheque on behalf of the people and say to them, "Actually, you do not have to work for this at all because Boyd Barrett has come to the rescue."  We are the only ones who can sort this out.  Irish people, as the Deputy will appreciate, given the educational sphere from which he comes and his understanding of our history, have dealt with adversity before in a pragmatic fashion.  When they are told the truth about the scale of the problem, they will say, "I want to help and sort this out" not in their own interests but in the interest of those who come behind them.  We will have distinct advantages if we pull this together, as we are doing, and make progress.  While the challenge is enormous, the reward will be worth it in the sense of having a country that is well run, with a thriving economy.  Opportunities to make our talents available on a global scale are well worth following through.I am heartened by the constant stream of queries from abroad about investment here and the constant energy of our own people in small and medium enterprises in the Deputy's constituency and all over the country who want to get out of this recession and to invest and employ people.

We will prove it.  As I have said to people on many occasions, if they have a problem in their business, we will try to help them and we will open those doors.  We have put in place the structures for this and will continue to do so.  We will indicate on a quarterly basis the progress we have made, be it with broadband or red tape and so on to enable business to thrive.The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, gave a detailed response at the last Council meeting on what had happened in Egypt, but the focus of the meeting was on Syria, where the situation was completely disastrous.  I can have details of the issue raised by the Deputy in respect of Egypt brought to her attention for a more detailed response.

When will the climate change Bill be published and when can we get down to debating it?No. 20 on the Order Paper is the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011.  When will this Bill be returned to the House?  An issue has arisen of late where a political party has raised approximately €1.2 million in North America through thousands of corporate donations.  The legislative framework we enacted must have firewalls to ensure money Irish political parties cannot access in North America cannot be accessed and used via circuitous routes for electoral funding here now that the inkjet gap has been filled.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Thank you.  There is a firm commitment to develop a cultural plan for future commemoration events such as the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  This morning I met relatives of the 1916 leaders to discuss their proposals for the development of an historic quarter in the vicinity of the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  The Taoiseach is aware of these proposals and actually walked the lanes with the relatives and listened to what they had to say.  Does he agree or is he able to tell the Dáil that their proposals are the most appropriate for the site in terms of its history, heritage, culture and tourism potential?  Does the Government have a mind to bring forward legislation, if needed?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Is legislation required?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	215	It is an important issue.  I walked the area some time ago with the relatives.  As the House knows, money has been set aside in the Office of Public Works for a commemorative process.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is chairing the committee dealing with the issue, in which he has a particular interest.  To be honest, there are quite a number of complications about the ownership of the site and the planning permission issued for Nos. 14-17 Moore Street which encompasses the national monument site.  However, it should be possible to arrive at a resolution, if that is the correct word, or a situation where one could have a very decent outcome to a lot of the deliberations in this regard.  I ask Deputy Gerry Adams to deal directly with the Minister who is chairing the committee and has visited the site and, possibly, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, in order that he might receive a more detailed response.  I do not want to say anything that will put him on the wrong track.  It is an important entity and, if we get it right, I foresee a brilliant opportunity for people to understand how a small country achieved its independence at the start of the last century.I was going to say the Deputy was more interested in the greenbacks than the Greens, but I will refrain from doing so.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It concerns legislation.  Many are very angry, shocked and concerned that the Government is considering selling such a vital asset to pay off bankers' gambling debts.  Given that this is its commitment, the legislative programme lists the forestry Bill which is supposed to deal with the management of our forests.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that, at the very least, the Bill will be discussed in the Dáil before the Government makes a final decision to dispose of our forest heritage to whatever venture capitalist fancies taking over them?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I will provide confirmation on two points.  First, the Government has no intention of selling the lands involved.  It has a view of the potential sale of State assets, including timber, and in its own time will make its own decision in the best interests of what it is we have to do.  Second, the forestry Bill will be introduced this session.  Therefore, I can confirm for the Deputy that there will be a full discussion before a decision is made on this particular State asset.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	227	There is nothing like a positive response.

As the Minister for Health is present, the Taoiseach might be able to answer on the issue of facilities in Clonmel, a matter which ended up in the High Court, in which the case was lost last week.  When will the Government inform the people of south Tipperary where they stand under A Vision for Change and what their future is?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	231	That is a matter for a Parliamentary Question.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	232	It is of utmost important that the bail Bill be pushed forward in this House.  I refer to this Bill, in particular, because of a serious incident which took place recently in my constituency.  It involved a young man being granted bail in the local courthouse who, almost immediately afterwards, proceeded to reoffend by committing another very serious crime which resulted in great distress being caused to those affected by his actions.  We are all aware of increases in the levels of crime and serious criminal activity throughout the country.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	233	There should be no speeches.

On housing, what progress has been made on the Bill to regulate voluntary housing associations which has been promised for some time and has a certain urgency attached?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I understand from the Minister for Health that the health insurance (risk equalisation) Bill should be ready before the summer recess.  I hope this will be the case as a good deal of work has been done on the Bill.

Where is it at?  When does the Taoiseach expect the pyrite panel, under Mr. Tuohy, to report?  Will the report come before the House and will we get a chance to debate it?  Several financial institutions, most of which are owned either by this state or the British state, have refused to engage in Mr. Justice Finnegan's resolution process for Priory Hall.  I thank the Taoiseach for the work he has done so far on Priory Hall.  The resolution process is about to get under way but some banks, owned by the House or the people, are refusing to get involved in the resolution process.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to ensure they come to the table and that we get a full resolution?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	256	We can only deal with promised legislation.

The criminal justice (legal aid) Bill will be later this year.  I spoke to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government today.  He has received confirmation from the banks that they will engage in the resolution process of Mr. Justice Finnegan.  When I was in Baldoyle at the announcement of the $500 million investment by Mylan, I met a number of the Priory Hall people.  My views on this matter are clear.  I am pleased to note the banks have confirmed they will engage in the resolution process.

#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for selecting this item, a matter which is affecting many thousands of people and many of my constituents in the Lucan and greater Clondalkin areas.  Today, my attention was drawn to a powerful speech by our President in America.  He referred to the anger felt in Ireland at the betrayal of trust by individuals and institutions that characterised the Celtic tiger economy.  One may ask what this has to do with delays in social welfare payments, but I believe it has a great deal to do with them.I understand the legislation that governs social welfare claims is section 241 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and that this is being reviewed and debated in the House at present.  I welcome the Minister's plan for an integrated service for jobseekers which seeks the merger of community welfare officers from the HSE, the employment services of FÁS and the jobseekers section of the Department of Social Protection.  I am also aware the Minister has inherited more than 1,000 community welfare officers in the Department of Social Protection this year.The reality is that if the Minister or I were so unfortunate as to become ill and we did not have the means, our applications would take up to 17 weeks to process.  It takes up to three months or more in the majority of cases and if an appeal is involved, it could take up to 40 weeks.  Since there is a shortage of staff in the investigation division, some appeals have gone beyond 60 weeks in cases involving an oral hearing, to which every person is entitled.I wish to bring another major issue to the attention of the House.  Let us consider applications for the various entitlements, including carer's allowance, disability allowance, family income supplement, invalidity pension, etc.  A major and significant factor in the processing of these applications is the location of the applicant and the office.  For example, I understand applications being dealt with in Tallaght and Clondalkin are from local offices as far away as Clondalkin and Galway.  This is causing considerable delays in the local offices.  In addition, there are no local offices in some regions.  This is the case in such areas as Lucan, Saggart, Newcastle and Rathcoole in my constituency.I refer to the matter of casual work.  Let us suppose a person is on social welfare payments or has a pending welfare payment and that person has an opportunity of casual work, short-term work, weekend work or several hours of work per week.  This complicates the system.  Many people have been advised not to take up certain opportunities to work because it would complicate the process and may impinge on one's social welfare allowance or one's pending supplementary welfare allowance.  Such a person may lose that allowance.  Something must be done to address these circumstances.  Since people are refusing a small amount of work and there are delays in welfare applications, they are visiting the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in an effort to find food and to have food paid for to survive.  This is the reality for many today.  I realise the Government has inherited the situation and we should not lose sight of that fact.  This makes the challenge all the greater.There is a three month waiting time for the family income supplement for the working poor as well.  There are more than 8,500 applicants awaiting an answer.  Organisations such as MABS have been inundated with 7,500 new cases.  Of the 29 free legal aid centres, a total of 22 are unable to meet the current client lists.  Charities are being inundated with requests for help.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.The Department is committed to ensuring claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, especially in the case of illness related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments may also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision process.  As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  For example, all State pension contributory and non-contributory claims are now processed, decided and maintained on the new processing system.  New claims for carer's and disability allowance are also decided on the new processing system, with existing claims due to transfer to the new system in quarters two and four of this year, respectively.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure processing capability is maximised.The staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising to ensure the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment or transfer from within the Department and other Departments, taking account of the employment control framework target as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.Since May 2008, some 990 staff have been assigned to the Department to fill critical vacancies and additional posts allocated to deal with the increased volume of claims.  Taking into account the numbers of staff who have left the Department and the numbers of vacancies, a net total of 226 additional staff has been assigned to the Department.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.Regarding the Social Welfare Appeals Office, I am advised that based on figures for the first quarter of this year the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions was 22.4 weeks, and 40.9 weeks for those that required an oral hearing.  The comparable times for last year were 25 weeks and 52.5 weeks, respectively.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's inspectors and medical assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  The considered processing of appeals must take an appropriate amount of time and cannot be unduly rushed due to the quasi-judicial nature of the work.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional appeals officers between 2010 and 2011.  In addition, a further ten appeals officers formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service, CWS, of the Health Service Executive joined the office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of appeals officers to 39.  In addition to that, the office has improved its business processes and IT support.I am assured by the chief appeals officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review and that the processes are continually being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.  The Minister is satisfied that progress is being made.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank the Minister of State and the Minister because this is a helpful report.  I welcome some aspects of the report.  Clearly, the flexibility shown by staff in dealing with some of the issues that arise requiring immediate responses is helpful.  The introduction of more modern technology leads to greater efficiency.  In particular, I welcome the reduction in the average waiting time although I am sure the Minister of State would agree that other cases will arise that will take much longer.The Minister may not be in a position to answer this question but notwithstanding the crisis this issue continues to present for quite a number of families, will she take back to the Minister my request that a working group be set up to examine the position?  For many people this is a crisis situation in the Department and a working group to monitor it and try to resolve something that is causing hardship for many families might be a short-term solution but might also bring about a quicker resolution to the problem.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy.  There is definitely an issue regarding casual work and a need for greater flexibility to allow people take up whatever work is offered to them.  Equally, the high number of medical appeals that are upheld would indicate there are difficulties at the deciding stage regarding claims that entail medical evidence.  That is an issue that must be addressed.On the Deputy's proposal for a working group, I am happy to take that back to the Minister for Social Protection.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I welcome the Minister.  He will be aware of the plans and consideration given to closing RTE's London office in September of this year.  I applaud the fact that RTE is taking its cost saving measures seriously.  At a time when all businesses are rationalising and examining cost benefit analyses there is no reason RTE should be any different.  However, leaving aside the rationalisation aspect, the political perspective in terms of what we signed up to in 1998 is that we have a North-South and an east-west dimension.  To digress somewhat, the RTE office in Belfast enhanced its services following the agreement in 1998 but there is an east-west dimension also.  We now have a British-Irish Council office, with its secretariat set up in Edinburgh.  We are examining enhanced co-operation, building on existing good relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland, and there is a political perspective in that regard, especially in light of the BBC offices located in London, throughout the United Kingdom and also in Belfast.  It also has an office in RTE at Donnybrook.My point is about journalistic perspective.  While we must rationalise, and if that means closing an office I will agree with it if there are savings to be made, we still must have journalistic perspective.  I am not a journalist but it will not be good enough if we contemplate introducing a reactionary journalistic perspective to the United Kingdom.  It will be inexplicable if we decide to take the human resource out of the United Kingdom.  We can consider different permutations in terms of how that can be done.  We can examine the model in Donnybrook where the BBC has a desk and also the possibility of an RTE desk being facilitated in London.  That is an issue on which we must think outside the box.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I support Deputy Joe McHugh's comments.  In asking the Minister for an update on the plans to close the RTE office in London I ask him also for his views on that in light of the role that office has played in the coverage of British-Irish relations, including the steps taken jointly by both countries in respect of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The RTE office in London has covered milestones in British-Irish relations which were important to the peace process.  They include the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration and meetings held over the years between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.A bedrock of good quality public broadcasting is news.  Talent shows and celebrity quests come and go but the news is the solid part of a public broadcaster or any good quality television station.Regarding British-Irish relations, I chair the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which Senator George Mitchell attended on Friday last.  One of the points he made was that the Good Friday Agreement was the end of the beginning.  In agreements on peace processes it is often the implementation that is the difficult part.  Much work remains to be done regarding British-Irish relations.  Many parts of the Agreement remain to be implemented and many issues remain to be addressed, and the role of RTE in covering all of those is extremely important.There is a need to respect the fact that many people on this island have a strong connection with Britain due to our history and through emigration.  Unionists in Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole identify with Britain.  Approximately 113,000 British citizens live in this state.  The Good Friday Agreement provides that people in Northern Ireland may identify themselves as Irish, British or both and, accordingly, they have a right to hold British and Irish citizenship.  This is another important factor.As a child of Irish emigrants to Britain, I am aware of our strong connection with the Irish community in Britain.  Irish emigrants in Britain object to the closure of the RTE London office.  It is important that we maintain our ties with Irish emigrants by keeping open the office, if possible.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I appreciate the contributions of Deputies McHugh and Tuffy and thank them for raising this important issue.  I stress, however, that RTE is an independent national public service broadcaster whose remit and obligations are set out in law.  Section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 states the principal objects and associated powers of RTE, while section 98 provides that the organisation shall be independent in the pursuance of these objects, subject to the requirements of the Act.  As such, I, as Minister, have no function in general day-to-day matters, including decisions on closure or otherwise of any of the corporation's overseas news bureaux.There is no doubt that RTE's news bureau in London has, as both Deputies noted, played an important role in the organisation's news broadcasting over the years.  It has, in the best traditions of good public service broadcasting, delivered high quality news reporting on some events of major importance that have taken place in the United Kingdom and in British-Irish relations, particularly the peace process.  I agree the London bureau has played not only a constructive role but has had a formative influence on the evolution of relations between our two countries in the relevant period.  That said, as we enter the era of digital media, the necessity for on location overseas news bureaux is not nearly as acute as it once was.I am assured that the regrettable decision to close the news bureau in London was not taken lightly by RTE but in the context of a restructuring and cost reduction programme across the entire organisation.  RTE has a serious financial problem, having incurred a net deficit of €17 million in 2011.  Its commercial revenue has fallen sharply from €240 million in 2008 to €168 million in 2011, a reduction of 30%.  It is crucial that the key elements of its restructuring programme are completed before the end of 2012 in order that the corporation can return to a break even or small net surplus position from 2013 onwards at the latest.RTE has informed my officials - it is important to recognise this - that the measure will not mean an end to RTE's long relationship with Britain or the Irish in Britain.  The organisation has assured my Department that, as part of its public service remit, it remains committed to covering British news, Anglo-Irish politics, the important economic, trade and business ties between Britain and Ireland and stories from the Irish emigrant community.  I am advised by RTE that staff and resources from its news bureaux in Dublin, Brussels or Belfast will be deployed, as appropriate, to cover major news stories in London.  This does not require the maintenance of a costly fixed facility or permanent staff in London.  When all costs are taken into account, RTE has advised my Department that the cost of the news bureau and sales presence in London was in the region of €800,000 per annum.This difficult decision is one of many to be undertaken by RTE and its workforce to secure the future of public service broadcasting.  I am satisfied the organisation continues to review all its operations and costs to achieve the best balance of efficiency and service within the resources available to it.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	275	As the Minister does not have any direct authority over decisions taken by RTE, I will bypass him and address my comments to the public service broadcaster.  "Out of sight, out of mind" is a common saying in business.  We want to build on the events that took place 12 months ago when Queen Elizabeth paid a symbolic visit to this country and spoke of creating a space for bridge building and developing new relations.  In that context, it is inexplicable that RTE has decided to withdraw a human resource element from the United Kingdom.  I do not say this lightly.  The Minister is a person who calls a spade a spade.   I ask him to use his office and articulate the importance of RTE having a human resource element in the UK.  If a significant event takes place in Britain, there is no point buying a Ryanair or an Aer Lingus ticket and instructing a journalist to board the next flight to get the story.  Stories develop and relationships are built.  I hope the Minister will issue guidance and we will see common sense prevail in this matter.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	276	On the Minister's comment concerning his function, RTE's decision to close its London bureau is a matter of public interest.  In that regard, I note the issue was also raised in Westminster through a cross-party motion signed by Margaret Ritchie, MP, Mark Durkan, MP, and a number of MPs from the Labour Party and Conservative Party.  The motion states that "on-the-spot access for Irish-based media and engagement in public life in this jurisdiction is vital to fulfil the vision of future British-Irish relations as set out by the Prime Minister and Irish Taoiseach in their historic statement of 12 March 2012".We are at an historical juncture in British-Irish relations following the visit of the Queen and the peace process is ongoing.  If it was important to have a news office in London in the past, it is just as important that RTE maintains such an office today.  The move to close the London news bureau is a short-termist decision.  RTE is a public broadcaster and I hope that the Minister and Deputies, as public representatives, will influence this decision.  Good quality news programming is what distinguishes public service broadcasters from other broadcasters and dumbing down to cut costs will eliminate this distinction.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I acknowledge the conviction shown by Deputies Tuffy and McHugh on this matter and I accept their passion is motivated by the best of reasons.  However, they will be surprised to learn that by the end of 2012, the deficit at RTE will have reached €50 million, an unconscionable sum, of which the great preponderance is in the redundancy programme.  The organisation faces an acute financial crisis and I cannot acquiesce in it running a bottom line of that order.In an era of digital media, it is not necessary to have the same on location provision.  Rental of accommodation in the heart of London is extremely expensive.  If it were possible for RTE to make savings elsewhere, I am sure it would do so.I accept Deputy Tuffy's point that the decision has a public interest dimension and, while I am not in charge of the day-to-day management decisions of RTE, she is correct that I have a policy responsibility arising from the public interest dimension to which she alludes.   In circumstances where I have had to meet the board of RTE about the financial crisis confronting the organisation and when senior management in RTE is doing its best to preserve what is best in public service broadcasting while addressing that financial crisis, it is impossible to give an answer to the House and say the closure of any bureau is not at issue.  I am advised by the professional people in RTE that between Belfast, Brussels and Dublin, in an era of digital technology, it is possible to ensure the quality of presentation from London does not suffer.I do not see any reason we cannot review this decision in better times, but in the short term and a competitive broadcasting landscape, where complaints are constantly made about the amount of revenue available to RTE in the dual sense, we have to assume control of the runaway finances.  That is the only reason for this decision.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's decision to select this important matter.  The serious concerns about the grossly unfair treatment of a pregnant teenage girl underline the need to develop clear and fair admission policy guidelines as part of a broader approach to ensure fairness and equality in the education system.  The Office of the Children's Ombudsman carries out important work and the concerns of the ombudsman are clear from her comments, as she has requested that the school involved apologise for excluding the 16 year old girl in question.  While the Minister may not want to comment on the school, he must have a view on the general issue of refusing access to a student on grounds such as those cited by the school.  It is absolutely scandalous in this day and age for a school to refuse admission to a girl simply because she is the mother of a child.  Most would agree that the behaviour of the school is unacceptable and that such instances should never be allowed to happen.  This is discrimination, pure and simple, and it is most disappointing that it is happening.  Nobody in the education system should be discriminated against, whether a gay teacher looking for employment or a young girl looking for entry to a school.What is the timeframe for the introduction of the admissions policy guidelines about which the Minister has spoken?  Will school inspectors scrutinise admission systems in the future based on these guidelines?  Will the guidelines be legislated for?  Are the requirements of the Education Act 1998 that each school have an admissions policy applicable to all private schools?  We want to see an inclusive and modern education system in place in this country.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	279	When I read this story, I was appalled at the treatment of the young girl at the centre of the case.  An unplanned pregnancy is incredibly stressful for a young girl and the discourtesy shown to her by the school was something she could have done without.Research and personal experience tell us that if young people are given every opportunity to complete their education, they will go on to reach their full potential.  How then have we arrived at the situation outlined by Deputy Brendan Smith?  How was a State funded school allowed to impose its own set of beliefs in a manner that could, at best, be described as blunt and, at worst, vindictive?  We have heard from the Ombudsman, Ms Emily Logan, that the spirit of the Education Act 1998 is accessibility.  In this case, the principal did not adhere to that spirit.The mother at the centre of this story has been discriminated against in a modern society in the most despicable manner.  It gives me no pleasure to raise this issue in the Dáil.  The media spotlight cast on this story must be adding to the discomfort of the mother and the family at the receiving end of this scandalous treatment.  One has to wonder in what century are we living when the school in question has refused to issue an apology to the young mother involved.  To me, that is arrogance at its absolute worst.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills is to launch an inspection in the coming weeks.  I would like to know when that is going to happen.  How will the Department ensure schools are adopting and following a policy of equality in admissions for all students?
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	280	We have come a long way from the story of Anne Lovett, a girl of 15 years who died in her school uniform while giving birth to a child in 1984.  We have come a long way since a member of my own family was refused re-entry to her secondary school 20 years ago on becoming pregnant at 17 years.  Irish society has moved on, but our legislation has not.  It is important to recognise in this House that there are many schools around the country which deal with this situation every day in a compassionate, caring and understanding manner.  If we bring ourselves back to the days of Anne Lovett, we are back to a situation where we isolate and condemn and push teenage parents out of the education system.Pending the introduction of legislation, the Minister should ask the Department to issue a circular immediately to all secondary schools to advise them how to deal with such cases.  They are doing so under their own policies.  They need guidance and policy advice from the Department.  I recognise that the Minister has pre-empted this discussion by  creating a working group on admissions policies and indicating that the legislation is pending.  However, in this case, we need a circular immediately from the Department.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14391	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I reiterate my concern at the treatment of this young person which is completely at variance with any republican principle to which we adhere as democrats.  The manner in which this young person was treated was also un-Christian.  I sympathise with her and agree with the Deputies.I can confirm to the House that the Department and the Minister take this matter very seriously.  On foot of correspondence from the Ombudsman for Children, the Department has initiated an inspection of the school concerned and that inspection is ongoing.  The first part involved an unannounced incidental inspection visit which took place in February.  A second inspection visit will be completed this month.  It is expected that the report on the inspection will be completed before the end of June.  In order not to prejudice the outcome of the inspector's report, I do not propose to comment further on the specific case.  That is not to fudge the issue, but in respect of enrolments generally, the current position is that every school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy in such a manner as the board, with the agreement of the patron, considers appropriate.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeals process where a board of management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, it is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.The Minister has made the issue of reform of enrolment in schools a priority since taking up office.  Last June he published a discussion document on school admissions aimed at leading to changes in regulations and legislation on how primary and post-primary schools allocated places to students.  Central to the question of enrolment is the need to ensure a fair and transparent system in all schools which does not discriminate unfairly against students or parents.  The discussion paper on a regulatory framework for school enrolment contains suggestions on how the process of enrolling in schools can be made more open, equitable and consistent.  The has made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.  The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.Education partners and interested parties were invited to submit their views to the Department by 28 October last and officials are co-ordinating the submissions received.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.  The Minister intends to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure every child is treated fairly and has a place at school.I hope this answer is an adequate response to the questions raised by the Deputies.  There is no timeframe for the legislation.  With regard to enrolment policy, there should be no distinction between publicly and privately funded schools.  That is a personal opinion.  If we cherish all the children equally, where they go to school should not affect how they are treated.  That is a personal view but it is one I would articulate in any legislative piece and I have made my view known to the Minister
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Could he ask the Department to check my particular query?  I presume the section of the Education Act 1998 is applicable to all schools, whether private or public.  Could the Minister of State confirm that, perhaps in the next few days?Comments attributed to some of the education partners are important and set out clearly what the norms should be.  Overall, schools are, and should be, supportive of pregnant teenagers and of young mothers.  I refer to the comment of Mr. Clive Byrne, chief executive of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, who said, "It is the norm that schools routinely deal with issues like this in a supportive way".  Mr. Ferdia Kelly, of the Joint Managerial Body, stated that pregnancy should never have been an issue.  He said, "Schools are highly supportive and pastoral towards girls who find themselves pregnant.  There is never a question of their position in the school coming into question."  I also refer to the comment from the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland that every school should have an "open and transparent admissions policy which is inclusive, which actively promotes equality of access, and which is fully compliant with legislation".  I hope the regulations and legislative framework can be put in place to ensure those policies are administered in every school.  An important comment from the representative teen parents' support programme, Margaret Morris, states, "It is not acceptable that any school would not be supportive."
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I welcome the Minister of State's response regarding the unchristian nature of this girl's treatment.  I also welcome the response of the Department.  This is an opportunity for the Department to look outside the walls of Marlborough Street in influencing policy.  Projects and services throughout the country have been dealing with situations like this for many years, and in a supportive and positively outcome-focused way for girls and children.Deputy Smith mentioned teen parents' support initiatives.  I have much admiration for the Waterford student mothers' group which was set up more than ten years ago by a home-school-community liaison teacher who saw that girls who became pregnant were not coming back to school.  The group's mission was simple.  It was to ensure girls completed their leaving certificate because all the evidence shows us that if a girl does so, her child will go on to have a more fulfilled educational experience.  The service is run by Barnados in Waterford and has been working closely with all the schools in the city and county for more than ten years.  The group has a 100% record in terms of girls completing their leaving certificate.I ask the Department to look outside its walls and put best practice and policy in place to ensure everyone gets equal access to education.

Two months ago, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education visited a project in Tallaght which is run by Frances Chance on behalf of Barnados.  It also deals with student fathers, whose emotions also need to be cared for.  As was suggested when we visited the project, leadership is taking place within communities and schools, but it is not coming from the Department.  We are waiting for legislation on enrolment, which is fair enough.  However, we need an immediate communication from the Department to all second level schools giving policy advice on how to deal with a young student who finds herself pregnant or with a young father who may be going through emotional turmoil.  It is important we take that leadership.  I suggest the Minister of State talk to his officials and ensure it takes place.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14391	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank the Deputies for their considered views on the issue.  All education stakeholders throughout the land would look with empathy on this case.  There is sense of empathy for the girl given the manner in which she was treated.  This example is an aberration in the system.  A decision was taken by one school.  The system and its stakeholders, by its nature, is empathetic and deals positively with people in all sorts of circumstances.I take the points made about the need for greater co-ordination at departmental level.  That is something that could be worked through the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Perhaps an initiative could arise out of those meetings that have taken place.The Minister has made it very clear that discrimination of this nature is unacceptable.  We would all agree with that position and I restate it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this topic to be discussed and the Minister of State for coming to the House to debate it.When the Ennis to Gort motorway, including the bypass of Crusheen, was completed some years ago, people in east Galway and the west were looking forward to the commencement of the Gort to Tuam motorway.  As well as the need for the motorway, there was a hope that the project would create employment.The Minister of State knows the history of this project.  In 2010, the contract for the project was awarded to the BAM Balfour Beatty consortium, which could not secure the financial backing to start it.  Later, the National Roads Authority had discussions with the consortium known as Roadbridge.  Again, private funding was a problem.  It is now reported that consideration has been given to completing the Gort to Athenry section only.This will not be good news for Tuam, where there is traffic congestion, while for years there have been traffic delays between Tuam and Galway city.  Four years ago, a €29 million water, sewerage and utilities scheme was sanctioned for Tuam.  It has become known as the big dig.  It is nearly complete and will be of great benefit to the town.  It is a great comfort that the work is to be finished.  There has been major traffic disruption in the town of Tuam and there will be huge disappointment if the bypass, which was earmarked six years ago, is not included in the road development.  If the funding allows a motorway from Gort to Athenry, there is the question of Claregalway.  What are the proposals for Claregalway?I know the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, have shown their commitment to funding motorway projects.  They have stated this clearly with regard to the west.  I raise this issue to learn from the Minister of State if funding is available for the motorway.  I know funding from private sources has been difficult to obtain but the west has suffered cutbacks to transport infrastructure projects.  There have been cutbacks relating to Galway airport and delays on the western rail corridor.The Minister has not been hopeful about the western rail corridor project recently.  Neither has he been hopeful about the future of Galway Airport.  These are all related because they are part of the transport infrastructure we would like to see in the west.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to deal with this matter in the absence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and funding the national roads programme.  However, the planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects are matters for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The N17-Nl8 PPP scheme is approximately 57 km in length and commences at the northern extremity of the N18 Gort to Crusheen scheme and ends in the vicinity of Tuam.  It will replace the existing N17 and N18, providing bypasses for the towns of Clarinbridge, Claregalway and Tuam where significant delays frequently occur.  Originally there were three separate schemes.  The N18 Oranmore to Gort road scheme was approved with modifications by An Bord Pleanála on 6 June 2007.  The M17 Galway to Tuam road scheme has been the subject of an An Bord Pleanála oral hearing and the motorway scheme was approved by it on 6 March 2009.  The N17 Tuam bypass was approved by An Bord Pleanála in August 2006.  A technical advisory consultant was appointed and commenced work in September 2007.The project will significantly improve safety, reduce journey times, improve connectivity within the western region and significantly assist in the economic development of the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region.  The scheme will improve access to Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport at Knock which has been identified as a major infrastructural requirement for sustaining industrial growth in the region.  Additionally, the development of a high quality dual carriageway-motorway link between Letterkenny and Waterford is a specific objective of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2007 to 2013 and the proposed N17-N18 PPP scheme represents a part of the proposed network.The PPP project has been procured as an untolled road scheme with payments by the public sector to be based on an availability-based payment mechanism throughout the operational period.  It must be recognised that the payment mechanism obliges the NRA to make availability payments to the PPP company, which gives rise to an ongoing financial commitment annually from 2017 to 2041.  As the Deputy is aware, the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances where the country has been the subject of intervention by the IMF and the European Union.  Despite this, every effort will continue to be made to progress this PPP within the timeframe of the current capital programme which runs to 2016.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The Minister of State concurred with my point on the length of time it has taken to realise the project, given that the planning and design stage dates back to 2007.  Approval was given by An Bord Pleanála for the Tuam bypass in August 2006 and a technical advisory consultant was appointed and commenced work in September 2007.  The delay in proceeding with the project has been frustrating for people who live along the road and generally in the west.  I hope the Minister of State will continue his discussions with the NRA to see whether approval can be given for the motorway project.Suggestions have been made that funding could be forthcoming from investors in Europe.  The Minister of State outlined there would not be a toll payable on the road, but media reports suggest otherwise and a toll plaza could be provided.  Perhaps he might clarify whether there is to be a rethink on the matter?  A toll plaza was not envisaged in the original proposal, but that was when the economic climate was better.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State addressed the extra points I have made.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I accept the project has taken a considerable length of time.  I know the value of such a road, as I am familiar with the area and the towns affected.  I have been subject to delays there on many occasions in my current job and previous ones.  The scheme is valuable, but, unfortunately, given the economic environment, as the Deputy is aware, funding is an issue.  However, we are working with the NRA to consider every single avenue from a funding perspective.  No stone will be left unturned to find a solution to the problem.No change is envisaged on the issue of tolling.  There is no plan to toll the road and no indication that there will be a change of mind in that regard.  The economic logic behind such a proposal would not stand up to scrutiny.It was suggested work on the 57 km stretch of road could be carried out on a phased basis, but I envisage the ultimate goal would be to complete the entire length, encompassing the towns to be bypassed, because the sum of the parts would be more valuable than any one part on its own and it would be of more benefit if the work was done in one go.  As the Deputy is well aware, when that will be is something on which we will continue to work.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Bill that I am introducing to the House will establish a legislative framework for commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, or CVR, in the State.  It will see the functions of local authorities on CVR being assumed by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  It will also provide for a change to the administrative arrangements associated with the processing of driver licences and the management of the driving licensing service.  Again, this function is transferring from the local authorities and will be centralised with the designation of the RSA as the licensing authority under Part III of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  The provisions relating to the two areas will bring about significant and positive changes to the way in which each is operated and managed.  That will result in major service improvements for all users.  In relation to CVR, the Bill will provide for a new licensing or authorisation system in respect of test centres and authorised testers, as well as greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators' premises in respect of vehicle maintenance and roadworthiness.The administrative change to driver licences will also provide the necessary support for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence in Ireland at the beginning of 2013.  The reforms being delivered on foot of the Bill will result in significant savings and a more efficient and focused service to the public.  These initiatives are important elements of the Department's action plan under the Croke Park agreement.  I commend the leadership and commitment shown by all those involved in delivering the reforms, particularly the local authorities and the RSA.  These are challenging times and we must recognise all those who are working to deliver the types of service change that underpin the Bill.Before I get into the detail of the Bill, I wish to explain the background from which these proposals emerged.  A number of years ago the nation's attention was grabbed by the occurrence of a number of high profile collisions involving commercial vehicles, some with tragic consequences.  The Kentstown bus crash, when five young school girls lost their lives, shone a light on certain issues, including the condition of commercial vehicles using the roads and that collision, in particular, acted as a trigger for the development of the current CVR reform programme which is based on recommendations that emerged from a comprehensive review undertaken by independent consultants on behalf of the RSA.  The review was initiated at the request of the former Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, and the recommendations were subsequently approved by the Department.The recommendations involved, primarily, two courses of action that would seek to raise the overall standard of commercial vehicle testing across the country on a permanent basis.  The first was to undertake a complete overhaul of the CVR testing system.  In order to do this successfully, a three-strand approach was recommended that, first and foremost, would address the testing process to ensure roadworthiness tests were conducted impartially and correctly at all times.  It was also recommended that this approach would encompass a programme of roadside inspections to ensure continuous compliance with roadworthiness standards and, most importantly, introduce operator premises checks and intelligence led targeting of operators based on risk.The second course of action was the transfer of responsibility for the management and operation of the commercial vehicle testing system from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  Currently, commercial vehicles undergo an annual roadworthiness test at authorised testing centres which are privately operated garages and the local authorities authorise and supervise these centres within their areas.The two elements of the reform are inextricably linked and necessary if we are to meet the overall objective of the transformation programme which will make a step change in the quality of commercial vehicles using Irish roads.  In meeting that objective we can also expect to improve road safety, reduce congestion, ensure fair competition, develop a much greater awareness of road safety issues and promote a culture of safety within the transport industry in respect of the use and maintenance of commercial vehicles, including trailers.Many in the industry have claimed that commercial pressures have led to some operators cutting corners in terms of vehicle maintenance and compliance with required vehicle standards, thus providing such operators with an unfair commercial advantage.  This is not hearsay and the claims are supported by RSA-Garda enforcement activity and reports from enforcement authorities in other EU member states on the defects found in Irish commercial vehicles.A failure to act would perpetuate this problem to the detriment of operators who take a more responsible attitude.  In the current economic climate it is even more important to take all necessary steps to ensure the roadworthiness and quality of the national vehicle fleet does not deteriorate further.  In fact, allowing vehicle owners and operators to cut corners is both anti-competitive and dangerous.In terms of safety, an estimated 17.5% of fatalities on Irish roads arose from collisions involving commercial vehicles and an improvement in the roadworthiness of those vehicles will save lives.  Such improvements could also result in substantial savings to the State.While it may seem insensitive to discuss the financial cost of fatalities, it is a reality.  For example, in 2010 there were 27,085 collisions on the roads at an estimated cost to the State of €850 million, an astonishing amount.  The avoidance of four fatal collisions or 25 serious injury collisions per year, in incidents involving commercial vehicles, would more than cover the operational cost of the reform being proposed.  Undoubtedly, it is avoidance of loss and pain for the families involved that will prove to be the ultimate gain.Another major contribution of this reform is to reduce congestion caused by breakdowns of commercial vehicles.  It is estimated that up to 10% of total congestion on primary roads is caused by such incidents.  Vehicles not compliant with the roadworthiness testing system are considered to be a significant contributory factor.  Based on UK estimates of the economic impact of such incidents, the cost to Ireland would be in the range of €1 billion to €2 billion.  It is clear that avoiding even a small number of these incidents, for example, on the M50 or the port tunnel, would have considerable economic benefit.Other indirect benefits from a reformed system include increased business for the vehicle maintenance and testing industry, increased revenue to the Exchequer from fines for non-compliance and a restoration of and improvement in the reputation of the transport industry.  The measures will support compliant operators in their business through more effective enforcement of non-compliance provisions.  The measures will also support a system which reduces the administrative burden on operators, including, for example, the need for a visit to a motor tax office to obtain a certificate of roadworthiness and online motor tax for commercial vehicle owners.Following approval of the proposals, the RSA developed a transformation roadmap which outlined a phased approach to establishing a reform programme for the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing system.  Preparations are well advanced for implementing the many elements of this roadmap and the requisite numbers of staff have been transferred from local authorities.With the legal support of the provisions in the Bill, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the RSA will proceed immediately to the drafting of the necessary secondary legislation to enable the RSA to take the final steps to put in place the revised structure for CVR.  Subject to the appropriate legal provisions being in place, it is envisaged that the testing function will transfer to the RSA by the end of the year.  Furthermore, the new system of managing and supervising the performance of test centres to ensure a minimum consistent standard of testing across the country will be in place by the end of the year.  The other measures will be in place in the first half of next year.The other area to which the provisions of the Bill relate is the transfer of the driver licensing function from local authorities to the RSA.  The current Irish driver licence system came into being in 1964 and has a number of strands.  Local authorities, operating from motor tax offices, are responsible for processing applications and delivering licences; budgetary responsibility for the licence service rests with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for policy oversight and the driver licence database which is managed by the National Vehicle Driver File in Shannon.  Operational oversight at national level and certain elements of policy guidance rests with the RSA.The change being undertaken was triggered by the need to introduce the plastic card driving licence to Ireland in 2013.  Under EU Licensing Directive 2006/126, all member states are required to introduce a plastic card driver licence in January 2013.  The introduction of this new form of licence presented an opportunity to review the licence issuing system as a whole and examine whether greater efficiencies could be achieved by a change of approach.  The review, conducted on behalf of the RSA, concluded that, while the existing licensing delivery system had some advantages, the distributed nature of motor tax offices gave rise to variable practices, inefficiencies and an inability to benefit from economies of scale.For reasons of security, efficiencies and economy of scale, the review suggested the actual plastic card should be produced by an outsourced provider.  Apart from other considerations, it would not be economically feasible to site plastic card production facilities at multiple locations.The main recommendation from the review was that a centralised model for dealing with all aspects of the plastic card driver licence be proceeded with.  The advantages flowing from such an approach cover identity features, security, customer service, efficiency and value for money.  Having examined the review, the Minister considered various State bodies and concluded that the RSA was best positioned to undertake responsibility for centralised processing and production of driver licences.  The authority already holds responsibility for the driver theory test and driver testing.  The extension of its functions to include licence processing and production brings a synchronicity to this area and provides the customer with a one-stop-shop approach to driver licensing.Having set out the context, I will outline the major provisions of the Bill.  First, I should clarify that while the Bill vests all of the powers and functions in the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is intended to confer these powers on the RSA.  This is provided under section 37.Part 2 of the Bill provides the new legislative framework for CVR testing in the State.  This Part of the Bill will cover all aspects of CVR from a regulatory perspective and provides significant powers for various statutory officers to support the reform of the system.Chapter 1 provides for the making of regulations on commercial vehicle testing and certificates of roadworthiness.  It includes relevant offences for using a vehicle without such a certificate and provides that both the person using the vehicle and the owner can be guilty of an offence if they are not the same person.Under section 7, a member of An Garda Síochána will also have the power to demand a certificate of roadworthiness from the driver or the owner of a vehicle within one month of an occasion where the member has reasonable grounds for believing the CVR vehicle was being used in a public place.Chapter 2 contains perhaps the most significant provisions in terms of the reform programme.  It establishes a new regulatory regime for authorised testers who are responsible for operating the test centres, carrying out the tests and issuing pass statements for CVR vehicles.  The Bill provides for replacing the term "authorised tester" with "CVR test operator".  The new regime, on commencement of these provisions, will apply to existing authorised testers and the necessary transitional provision for this is provided under section 10.  The existing authorised testers will be required to apply for a renewal of their authorisation within 18 months of the commencement of section 10.  Any application to become an authorised tester that was being processed but not determined prior to the commencement of the legislation will also be covered by this section.The Bill sets out the detailed requirements that will be imposed on persons applying to be CVR test operators.  The provisions in this chapter will raise and strengthen the required standards necessary for authorisation.  Not only will conditions attaching to the authorisation deal with a number of areas, including categories of vehicles to be tested, the type of tests to be carried out and the requirements for testing centres and testers, it will also provide for other criteria against which an application may be considered.  These considerations include the need for the competent delivery of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, a well functioning, well maintained, accessible, competitive, integrated and safe network of CVR testing centres, and appropriate equipment, facilities and premises for testing.In addition to the above authorisations, section 17 provides for the authorisation of CVR testers, that is, those persons who physically carry out the tests on vehicles at the test centres.  This section provides a transitional provision for testers who are already registered for this purpose and provides that a register of authorised CVR testers may be established and maintained.  Similarly, there is a provision under section 29 that the Road Safety Authority shall establish and maintain a register of CVR test operators and that this register will be made available to all, both online and at the headquarters of the authority.  All aspects of authorisation in respect of both CVR test operators and CVR testers are overhauled by the Bill, with the new standards to be enforced by provisions to suspend and revoke authorisations when needed.  Sections 18 to 22, inclusive, provide for such suspensions and revocations in order that any non-compliance with the standards, conditions or directions prescribed in the legislation will have serious implications for authorised CVR test operators, as well as CVR testers.  Provision has also been made for the details of such suspensions or revocations under sections 18 and 19, respectively, to be made available, as appropriate, on the registers of CVR test operators and testers.The key to raising the national standard of commercial vehicle roadworthiness will be enforcement.  The Bill will allow for greater powers of enforcement through targeted roadside inspections and inspections of commercial operators' premises and CVR test centres.  These powers are being channelled through various statutory officers, namely, authorised officers, CVR inspectors and members of An Garda Síochána.  Sections 24 and 25 provide for the appointment of authorised officers and the powers of these officers in CVR testing.  Authorised officers will have the power, subject to section 26, to enter a CVR testing centre or any other premises where he or she believes CVR tests are being carried out and inspect the premises, equipment and facilities, as well as enter and inspect CVR vehicles.  The authorised officer will also be able to observe and supervise testing in progress and inspect or remove any documentation related to the maintenance and testing of vehicles.  Authorised officers will have the power to issue directions to a CVR test operator where tests are not being carried out as required.  Failure to comply with the requirements or directions prescribed will result in an offence being committed by the CVR test operators.  The full extent of the authorised officer's remit in CVR testing is clearly set out in section 25.In Chapter 3, section 31 provides authorised officers with additional powers in respect of CVR maintenance obligations. They will have similar powers to those mentioned, but under this provision, these powers will allow the officer to enter any premises where he or she believes CVR vehicles, or information on CVR vehicles, are being kept.  The section provides that an authorised officer can search premises to locate a vehicle and inspect such vehicles or any equipment being used to maintain the CVR vehicles.  He or she can also make a requirement of an owner or a person in charge to provide any documentation or information related to the maintenance of the vehicle.  The officer may inspect and take extracts or copies of such documentation.  These powers are extensive and should provide a very effective means of ensuring compliance with the standard of testing.Similarly, significant powers have been provided for CVR inspectors in Chapter 4 which deals with roadside inspections.  A CVR inspector will be a member of An Garda Síochána or a person appointed as an inspector under section 33.  Section 34 sets out the powers of a CVR inspector and provides that where he or she is a member of An Garda Síochána or accompanied by a member of the force, powers are provided to stop a vehicle and keep it stationary for a period that is reasonable for the purposes of carrying out an inspection.  Once a vehicle has been stopped by a member of An Garda Síochána, the CVR inspector will also have the powers to require the driver to produce a certificate of roadworthiness, seek information that assists in the inspection and drive a vehicle for a reasonable time and distance.  The CVR inspector will also have the power to carry out any tests or make any requirements deemed reasonable by the inspector for the purposes of inspecting the vehicle.  The provisions in regard to CVR inspectors go beyond this brief description, but it should give Deputies an indication of the types of powers that will be given to these statutory officers for the purposes of enforcement.Chapter 6 provides for the conferral of functions related to CVR on the Road Safety Authority which will take responsibility for the oversight, management and direct control of the CVR function and be central to implementing a robust testing regime.  The proposed overhaul of the CVR system involves the use of a risk register for systematic targeting of non-compliant operators and test centres, as set out in section 39.  Currently, most inspections are carried out on a random basis.  This largely random approach leads to compliant operators being inconvenienced as much as non-compliant or higher risk operators.  The current approach is also anti-competitive as non-compliant operators are being rewarded with commercial advantage due to incurring fewer maintenance and testing costs.  The risk assessment system is intended to be a fair system that is evidence based and which treats each operator consistently based on the information available.  Operators who adhere to good practices, hold appropriate records and consistently maintain their vehicles to the required standards will reap the benefits as compliance and enforcement activities are focused to a greater degree on higher risk operators.There was a good deal of debate in the Seanad about section 39.  Risk-based enforcement is consistent with the Government's programme to streamline enforcement activities.  Many of the existing regulatory agencies have already undertaken enforcement on a risk basis such as the Foods Standards Authority of Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is vital that available resources are effectively deployed to influence and maximise road safety outcomes.  The State cannot afford the resources necessary to control non-compliance by way of traditional deterrent-based enforcement.  Such an approach is inefficient and goes against the practice being adopted internationally.The CVR reform programme includes an integrated information technology system which will assist the Road Safety Authority in ensuring vehicle testing is carried out to a common standard.  This system is provided for in section 28.  The information and risk rating systems will be central to developing a modern and internationally recognised system of roadworthiness in Ireland.  The Bill will underpin everything envisaged and is testament to the work that has been done and will continue to be done by all parties in a very challenging environment.Chapter 8 deals with miscellaneous amendments to the Road Traffic Acts, some of which arise from the main provisions of the Bill.  These are not substantive amendments and are primarily technical in nature.  Part 3 deals with the transfer of the licensing function from local authorities to the Road Safety Authority.  As I mentioned, we will move to a plastic card licence next year and, as part of a review to determine the best means for introducing this new type of licence, a centralised model in respect of driver licensing provision was recommended.  This will be vested in the Road Safety Authority which will become the licensing authority for the purposes of processing, managing and issuing driver licences.  Section 49 amends section 4 of the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 to provide the authority with the functions of a licensing authority within the meaning of section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  Sections 50 to 55, inclusive, deal with all necessary amendments to the Road Traffic Acts and the Finance Acts to reflect this change in function.In summary, the objective of the Bill is, on the one hand, to introduce a reform programme that will improve the roadworthiness and safety of commercial vehicles and, on the other, to provide for the introduction of a plastic card driving licence with more efficient and effective management arrangements.  I hope Deputies will support, as always, the development of further road safety legislation.  I look forward to hearing their views on the proposals contained in the Bill.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation which, as the Minister of State said, has been in gestation for some time.  The previous Government had an active role in establishing the framework for and outline of its provisions.  The Bill is a useful instrument in the continued effort to reduce the number of deaths on the roads.  It is a regular feature of discussion in this House on road safety that we refer to the ongoing process of putting in place the building blocks of an appropriate legislative basis to deal with issues as they arise.  From that point of view, it is important that we continue to evolve the legislation and the public debate and discourse on road safety.  International experts point out that efforts in this regard must, of necessity, involve an iterative process and that governments must not sit on their laurels in the belief a particular legislative proposal is an end in itself.  While we can add to the body of legislation, we can also continue to generate public debate.  It is widely recognised and accepted that the more public debates that take place on road safety, the greater the improvement in driver behaviour will be.  When certain initiatives introduced by the Government or external bodies are well publicised and discussed in the media, there is an impact on driver behaviour, as is clear from a tangible metric: the monthly figures for road deaths.  RTE played a significant role some years ago when Charlie Bird used to compile an outline of the deaths in a particular month, with names and backgrounds, and the impact the deaths of the people concerned had on their families.  That was one of the most striking campaigns involving the media that brought about a realisation in the public mind of the importance of taking care on the road.  That led in a significant way to an adjustment in driver behaviour, but it was not enough in itself.  I appeal to media organisations to continue their work in highlighting what is going on in this House and the Road Safety Authority in initiating various initiatives.  It is only when the issue of road safety enters the consciousness of drivers that there is an effect on their behaviour.  The Minister of State has identified many of the changes that have taken place in recent years with the support of all parties.  I will not deviate from the good working relationship the House has enjoyed in the last ten years when working to save lives on the roads.  We will continue to support sensible provisions and measures brought forward as part of that process.  The next stage is identified in the Bill.The introduction of penalty points was ground-breaking in how it changed driver behaviour.  We must continue to look at this issue to ensure the application of sanctions is examined, particularly for drivers from the North of Ireland and outside Ireland.  It must be addressed at European level and the Government, because Ireland has done so much to save lives on the roads, should lead that debate in Europe.  There is an opportunity for the Minister of State, as we assume the Presidency of the European Union in the first half of next year, to lead a campaign on cross-border road safety issues, particularly penalty points.How do we deal with trucks from outside the State?  Will the provisions of this legislation apply to them?  What sanctions will we be able to impose without impounding a vehicle?  Drivers from outside the State must not have the opportunity to evade our judicial system.  The authorities in other countries are quick to impound trucks and detain drivers from other states.  It does not appear to be included in the Bill, but are there other provisions that could be used to deal with this issue?The introduction of speed cameras has been of great help in changing driver behaviour.  The roll-out of mobile cameras last year played a significant role in the continued reduction in the number of fatalities.I pay tribute to some people who are often overlooked.  The Bill makes provision to centralise road safety activities in the Road Safety Authority, but there are those in the local authorities who might feel that is a reflection on them.  We must move beyond this and accept that the RSA is the appropriate place in which to centralise these functions.  We are not casting aspersions on individual local authorities, but we can do a better job with a centralised authority.I recognise the tremendous work of the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority who has been a continuous campaigner and hugely successful in reducing the number of deaths on the roads.  Mr. Noel Brett, as a public servant, deserves credit from us all for his work.  I also recognise the chairman who was recently reappointed by the Government, Mr. Gay Byrne, who led a strong campaign, in addition to the legislative work done in this House, in taking the debate to the wider public and continuing to challenge the behaviour of drivers.We cannot get away from education and the role it plays in driver behaviour and ultimately in the saving of lives and reducing the costs that accrue from injuries in road accidents.  There must be greater involvement by the Department of Education and Skills.  We equip our young people for all sorts of life experiences such as examinations and careers, but one of the first things many children want to do before they leave school is learn to drive.  Unfortunately, the school system is somewhat redundant in the role it could play in that regard.  I am familiar with a number of initiatives around the country that have sought to work with schoolchildren to help them to develop an understanding of and a sense of responsibility for driving skills.The Bill is clear in its objectives.  It came about as a result of a number of serious accidents that have been well publicised.  It is important to recognise the statistics.  About 20% of all road fatalities involve commercial vehicles.  That is a striking figure that shows the need for the legislation.  It is also interesting that 48% of all commercial vehicles tested at the side of the road are found to be defective or fall short of the appropriate standards in some way; about 32% of these vehicles are in need of urgent attention.  If anyone thinks the legislation is a step too far, he or she should look at the statistics, particularly the potential for death and destruction on the roads.The Minister of State has also identified an issue that does not affect people until they are caught in a traffic jam.  Traffic disruption has an impact on the real economy which must be addressed.As someone who often traverses the country, I regularly see at the side of the road the outer rims of tyres that have come off trucks.  I do not know if that is as a result of remoulding but the practice should be outlawed.  I understand the commercial pressures faced by hauliers and businesses, but I have seen these strings of rubber become a nuisance on motorways.  Their presence has led to accidents and the issue should be addressed as soon as possible.Another issues that should be considered is the roll-out of truck stops.  There are now motorway stops built as part of the NRA's upgrading of the road network, while other private facilities have been put in place.  New stops could be basic; they do not need all the bells and whistles.  Driver fatigue is a huge issue that was not addressed by the last or the current Government.  I accept that the National Roads Authority indicated in the past that it was cost prohibitive to put in place the sophisticated truck stops it considered necessary.  It is also necessary to achieve a critical mass of activity in order for these facilities to be self-financing.  Basic rest areas are what is required and they need not even be manned.  Drivers must have the capacity to obtain a cup of coffee or boiling water or a glass of cold water and should be able to park their trucks or motor cars for 15 or 20 minutes or perhaps longer.  Making such facilities available should form the next part of the Government's approach to road safety.The Minister of State referred to the introduction of a plastic card driving licence.  This is a welcome development which has been in train for some time.  He also referred to outsourcing the work in respect of this matter.  That is a good idea because it would not be feasible to suggest the various local authorities take responsibility for this work.  Has consideration been given to asking the Passport Office to provide this service?  The Minister of State will be aware that it has a highly sophisticated back-office system and is well capable of meeting the various standards relating to biometrics, security features, etc.  I would have thought it might be the appropriate entity to provide the service.  Once responsibility for something as important as the production of driving licences is allowed to move outside the control of the State, there is always an expectation or a belief fraudulent activity might occur.While the Irish Road Haulage Association is broadly in agreement with the legislation and welcomes the provisions that will ensure a level playing field for all, it has some concerns about owner-operators.  I understand approximately 70% of the trucks which operate on our roads are from owner-operator fleets which are not obliged to licence their vehicles.  Therefore, the staff of the Road Safety Authority who will be carrying out roadside inspections will not have a clear picture of them because they will not be on the register.  Does the Government propose to deal with this matter?  Does it intend to impose on owner-operators, particularly those whose fleets exceed a certain number of vehicles, the same requirements as those which apply to others, or does it propose to include these individuals in the licensing regime in order that the database of information on them will be better and more comprehensive?The necessity to maintain vehicles to a higher standard will have an important ancillary benefit for the motor trade in general.  The requirement in this regard will place pressure on those unscrupulous operators who enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over those in the regulated industry, namely, those who have sought to operate by the book.  The position is the same on the rogue element within the road haulage industry that is currently utilising the services of fuel launderers.  This is placing those who operate above board at an exceptionally unfair disadvantage.  This matter was the subject of some discussion last week and I have no intention of commenting on the merits of the arguments made at that stage.  I will state, however, that the sooner the Government can come forward with a suite of measures to put the rogue element to which I refer out of business, the better it will be for those who seek to comply, pay their taxes, operate in a regulated environment and seek to meet the safety standards set down by the State.  Removing the rogue element should be to the fore in the Government's approach to this matter and it will be in the context of ensuring vehicles meet the appropriate standards.  It is welcome that the Government is going to put in place the necessary regime of rigorous inspections to ensure those in the rogue element to which I refer will not be operating vehicles which are less than satisfactory.The Government must extend its efforts in this regard into the area of laundered fuel, particularly as its availability is having an impact on hauliers who seek to meet the various standards set down.  In addition, it is estimated that the State is losing in the region of approximately €250 million each year as a result of the activities of the rogue element in question which, in turn, is supporting those involved in other criminal activities.  That money is badly needed by the Exchequer.Fianna Fáil supports the Bill and measures it contains.  We look forward to its enactment.  However, it will be necessary to carry out significant work in order to deal with some of the anomalies.  As stated, it will be necessary, sooner rather than later, to address the matter of driver fatigue.  I do not accept that it is not commercially possible to deal with this matter.  It will be possible to identify appropriate locations that will serve as rest areas and it will not be necessary to spend the type of money required to provide the fine facilities which have already been put in place.  What is required are parking areas where people can rest.There is a need to deal with the issue of laundered fuel at the earliest opportunity.  The problem is having a significant impact on the haulage sector.  It is forcing those who might otherwise have been compliant and service their trucks on a regular basis out of business or placing them in a position where - against their will - they are taking shortcuts in order to maintain their living and ensure their staff remain in employment.  Those to whom I refer would not normally take shortcuts or chances and are law abiding in every other possible respect.I ask the Minister of State take action to deal with the problems caused by the strips of rubber which come free from the tyres of trucks and are deposited on motorways.  Will he also consider how penalty points might be applied to individuals from outside the State?I do not wish to make a political point, but I feel compelled to do so.  I refer to the issue of enforcement.  We have referred to the good work being done by the Government and that which was carried out by the previous Administration.  However, enforcement is ultimately a way of ensuring compliance with the law.  The House can enact all the legislation it wants, but if this cannot be enforced, our efforts will come to naught.  The Government's decision to reduce the number of members of the Garda Síochána is going to have a significant impact in the context of the enforcement of the laws of the State.  There are many Members, me included, who have ended up on the wrong side of the law in respect of speeding or acquiring penalty points and that is as it should be.  Members of the public must know that they are going to be caught if they drive at speed.  The putting in place of speed checks has been one of the greatest deterrents to people speeding.  It is also one of the major reasons the number of deaths on the roads has decreased to such an extent.  I am concerned that the reduction in the number of gardaí envisaged by the Government will make it impossible for the legislation to continue to be enforced.  This will have a corrosive effect over time in respect of the good work  done to date.I recognise that this matter does not fall within the Minister of State's remit.  However, I encourage him and the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to continue to fight the battle with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance in order to ensure we will not see a return of high numbers of deaths on the roads.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I thank Deputy Timmy Dooley for sharing time.I welcome this debate because it provides us with the opportunity to discuss road safety, the roadworthiness of trucks and various other issues.  My party supports any measures which will improve road safety.  We have a proud record in this regard.I hope the Minister of State will clarify a number of matters.  I refer, for example, to the cap on licence fees and the status of the 140 local authority staff whose services will no longer be necessary when the centralisation of services occurs.  What will happen to the staff to whom I refer?  I accept that they probably have some rights under the Croke Park agreement, but many of them are extremely concerned.Fianna Fáil and the former Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, were very much to the fore in promoting road safety.  Mr. Dempsey was heavily criticised on all sides of the House at times for his tough and stringent attitude on the issue.  He was not for turning on many of the issues he considered important to road safety such as changing the drink driving laws.  Some of the decisions taken at the time have borne fruit, with a serious reduction in the number of fatalities on the roads.  Any fatality, particularly of a young person, on the roads is traumatic for his or her family.  My daughter was killed in a road accident involving a truck.  Therefore, I am very much aware of the traumatic effect a road fatality has on a family.  Any decision taken to improve road safety must be welcomed.I was involved in the oil business for many years.  The standard of trucks nowadays is very good compared to what it was in the late 1970s and the early 1980s when there were many substandard trucks on the roads.  One depended on the local garageman on many occasions to keep an old truck on the road, despite the fact it would not really have been roadworthy.  We now have state-of-the-art trucks, nearly all of which are kept in good condition by their owners, be it a small family-run haulage business or a larger haulier company.  The Minister of State said, however, that 18% of road fatalities involved trucks or commercial vehicles, a number which is still too high.One concern raised on many occasions is the danger posed by trucks to cyclists, particularly in towns and cities.  A number of cyclists have been killed when dragged underneath a truck trying to manoeuvre around main and side streets, sometimes unbeknownst to the driver.  It is important that cyclists are allowed to travel and go about their business with the same safety enjoyed by other transport users.The issue of truck parkways was raised; it is one which has been raised with me by many transport operators.  They point out that they are required under EU regulations to take breaks from driving, but they have nowhere to park their trucks in seeking to do so.  I find that many of them are parking adjacent to housing estates, I presume for the security of knowing that there are many people nearby.  Those living in housing estates are concerned about the dangers these trucks pose to young children and people going in and out of the estates.  There is, therefore, a need for designated truck parkways.  I do not blame the Minister of State for this, however.  When I was a member some time ago of the local authority in Wexford, I often raised the point that even with all the grandiose county development plans in place, there were few designated areas where trucks could park.  I know several reviews of development plans are taking place, as well as the rezoning of many lands.  It is important that new areas are designated for truck parkways.  Some suggest such parkways also need to provide for the availability of diesel stations and shops.  However, all that is needed is a designated area where truck drivers can park freely and out of danger to other vehicles and pedestrians.  This issue should be examined in liaison with local authorities.A serious bone of contention among Irish transport operators is that truck drivers from other countries do not seem to receive the same attention or rigour of the law as they do.  They consider the Garda and transport inspectors more or less ignore foreign trucks when checking roadworthiness, the correct use of diesel and so forth, meaning they cannot operate like with like.  It is an area that needs to be examined.  Perhaps there is a problem in that the laws of the land cannot be imposed on a foreign truck here.Deputy Timmy Dooley raised the matter of laundered fuel which was discussed in the House last week.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he had a working group in his Department, comprising departmental officials and representatives of the hauliers' associations, seeking a solution to this problem.  I hope a solution can be arrived at as quickly as possible.  Not alone is it unfair on legitimate operators but the State is also losing significant revenue.  It is also important that Irish transport operators have access to the perks enjoyed by hauliers from other EU member states.The Road Safety Authority will take over the functions of local authorities in determining commercial vehicle roadworthiness.  I am not one - perhaps the Minister of State is the same – for having too much centralisation.  In fact, we should be getting away from it.  I had hoped local authorities would be given more powers in this regard, rather than passing everything up the line to others in Dublin and the RSA.  A concern among local authority staff is that there will be severe job changes.  Will the Minister of State clarify that those operating in this area in local authorities will be transferred to other duties or given the opportunity of working with the RSA?  It is important that as many of these staff as possible are taken on board with the RSA or given other job opportunities in the local authority system or the Department.The Bill is moving in the right direction and will improve safety on the roads.  As Deputy Timmy Dooley pointed out, a road fatality is very traumatic for the family affected.  Improved road safety would also see a reduction in hospital admissions.  The Bill's regulations to improve road safety are to be welcomed, but I hope the Minister of State will clarify some of the issues I raised.  We must ensure our truck operators continue to operate to a high standard.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	295	There seems to be a fundamental shift of local authority functions to new bodies such as Irish Water and, in the case of this Bill, transferring commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing to the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The replacing of local authorities as the agency responsible in this area is a retrograde step.  Local authorities have been starved of funding but have still managed to deliver excellent services.  There is an old saying that one does not fix what is not broken, and by and large, the testing of vehicles and their roadworthiness is borne out by that slogan.  There is a real danger that the centralisation of these services will lead to job losses and a lack of access for local people.  This is not about a better and safer service but the cutting of costs and, in the long run, it is part of a privatisation policy which Labour and Fine Gael is driving both in the short and long term.  Centralising everything makes the Government's agenda easier and putting everything on a automated freefone service makes the lives of citizens a misery.  It will undoubtedly lead to a deterioration of the service.The Government's plans for the water system and associated charges reflects Fine Gael's entire political basis and its wish to end the State provision of services because of the private sector's thirst for profit.  I cannot see how safety is served by that agenda.  These changes would do nothing radical to the system except make the process less user-friendly and accountable.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, will not run test centres.  That is not to say that certain provisions of this Bill do not have merit.  The problem is these are premised on the licensing and testing coming under the RSA ambit, and that is not helpful in the sustainable provision of good services.The IMPACT trade union has stated that this proposal flies in the face of an OECD report on public service in Ireland, which indicated that local authorities should be used more and not less in the provision of services like this.  There is no anecdotal or other evidence to support the Government's proposals, as colleagues have rarely reported any difficulties with the current model.  The Government's proposals are ideologically driven and a devious attempt to usher in softly less democratic and public control of services in exchange for private profit.  A saving of €4.5 million is touted as one of the great benefits but despite knowing better, I am surprised by this.  I am repeatedly shocked by the Government's willingness to herald with trumpets the savings of a few million euro when it is wasting massive amounts elsewhere.  This begs the question of how much of the saving is based on a transfer of funding responsibility from the State to the hard-pressed people getting their commercial vehicles tested.  They will give millions of euro every year to the RSA in testing alone, and who is to say the fees will not be increased.The provisions around better testing standards, training and equipment are good, and I have no problem with them.  Nevertheless, they are the fig leaf on which this very rotten deal is being sold.  There is nothing to stop the State placing more standardised requirements on local authorities, implementing a database or keeping better track of licences issued.  There is nothing to stop it putting in place measures to improve Garda enforcement except the great desire to cut everything possible from the Garda.  This will also lead to a lessening in the role of councillors.  The Minister of State has made representations to local authorities on these and other issues, and he and others always had great access because of councillors.  Rules and regulations can be improved by the local authority, with road safety being the primary consideration.  There have been significant strides made in road safety, with the appointment of Mr. Gay Byrne to the RSA an enormous contribution over the years.  Speed checks have also improved safety, and it is welcome to see those vehicles on the main highways.There have been media programmes covering malpractice at national car test, NCT, centres, but that is not the fault of local authorities.  Private firms are contracted for this work and although a programme detailed malpractice in the Ballymun centre, that was not the fault of the local council.  Part of the agenda being driven here is to blame the local authorities to make easier the transfer to the RSA.  Nobody disputes that proper checks and balances are required.  What will be the cost of the transfer of staff and expertise, as well as setting up the new RSA centre?  Staff and expertise are required but what will be the cost of moving the process from the people who were on the ground in the local authorities?  There will be a cost to the inconvenience, no matter where the location, as people will have to be moved.Under the Good Friday Agreement, signed by this Government in this State in 1998, the House recognises the importance of measures to facilitate the re-integration of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training, reskilling and further education.  The agreement recognises the political context of the conflict which occurred in Ireland between 1960 and the signing of the agreement, and that actions carried out by IRA volunteers were politically motivated.  As such, IRA prisoners were political prisoners and following the ceasefire they were released from prison as part of a process of peace building.  I will seek an amendment to exclude people covered under the Good Friday Agreement from any of the offences listed.  The Government's commitment should be in line with that of previous Governments.  I will set out my stall on a number of other amendments at a later stage.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I am a little puzzled by this proposed legislation.  Normally there is a fairly clear rationale with the presentation of legislation, although we might agree only with part of that.  Legislation would usually look to do something better or in a more cost-effective or streamlined fashion.  It would try to ensure there are more consistent standards or that it would be easier for people to access services contained in the legislation.  I do not see that happening in this legislation and I did not hear how this would happen in the Minister of State's presentation of the Bill.  That troubles me quite a lot.Road deaths have, unfortunately, affected almost every community and most families throughout this country.  The issue has caused much heartache and so much suffering for many, and it cannot be dealt with lightly.  It is important we have proper and sufficient regulation in place in order that the country's roads can be a safe place for every person using them.  Commercial vehicles should be subject to this proper legislation, as they make up a significant number of vehicles on the roads.  The roadworthiness of those vehicles must be ensured to be of the highest standards available if we are to be certain of road safety in so far as we can ever be certain of such safety.The ultimate objective of all legislation surrounding roadworthiness and traffic regulations is to save lives and prevent damage to limb and property on the roads.  There should be systems in place, therefore, that are simple, concise and clear, and which allow the best result for the roadworthiness of vehicles and safety of other road users.  l have referred previously to a fairly simple principle I use in life, which is to make it easy for people to do the right thing and make it difficult for them to do the wrong thing.  The people who need to be targeted by legislation such as this are those who do not provide for the proper upkeep of commercial vehicles and who, by their recklessness, put the lives and limbs of others in danger.The problem I have with the legislation is it will not improve the current system of commercial vehicle testing.  It will change a process but I do not see where it will change an outcome.  When a problem arises with licensing and the testing of the roadworthiness of a commercial vehicle, it should be stamped out at source and, therefore, taking powers from local authorities and handing them to a centralised body will not automatically lead to improved road safety.  A recent OECD report on the public service in Ireland argued that local authorities should be used more frequently in the delivery of public services and we need to have that debate in the House.  We need to examine the entire range of public services to ascertain what can best be done at local and national level and, in the absence of that debate and analysis, that legislation has pulled bits in isolation from the overall and tried to slot them into different places.  We need a wider analysis of the public service as a whole and we need to decide, based on rationale and logic, what can be done better at local, regional and national level.The current vehicle testing service enjoys a high level of customer satisfaction and I fear the legislation will further erode the provision of public services by local authorities.  For example, waste collection services have been privatised and there are serious concerns about the future of the control of our water services.  The privatisation of the licensing system for commercial vehicles cannot be a step in the right direction without the wider analysis which I mentioned being carried out.  I refer to the centralisation of medical card processing.  Most Members had queues of people calling to their constituency offices because of the centralisation of a service that was better provided at local level.  It was a debacle and it ran into the ground.  Those who were processing medical cards were not properly trained to do so and insufficient staff were available.  This service was supposed to improve the consistency and quality of decision-making, streamline the processing of applications and provide for faster eligibility decisions but it did exactly the opposite.  The service was centralised but not enough thought was given to the impact of centralisation.  The outcome was the opposite of the stated intention of the legislation dealing with the processing of medical cards.  However, the Government has not learned lessons from this debacle.  The public and staff still do not know what is happening.  So many complaints were received by Oireachtas Members that a delegation from the Joint Committee on Health and Children visited the medical card processing facility in Finglas.  How long will it be before transport committee members call to the new centralised office provided for in the Bill?We will table amendments to the legislation on the assumption it will pass this Stage, particularly to the section dealing with commercial vehicle test operators.  The section provides that it will be the Minister's prerogative to allow people who have been convicted of different offences to be employed as test operators.  As Deputy Ellis said, the legislation does not make allowances for those who qualify under the Good Friday Agreement.  They were political prisoners and they should not be excluded from employment.I ask the Minister of State and his officials to revisit the rationale for introducing the legislation and to think about whether it will improve the service for those who need access to it.  If there is a risk the proposed centre ends up like the medical card processing in Finglas, they need to go back to the drawing board.  If the Bill passes Second Stage, we will table amendments.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I support the Bill in principle but I have concerns, some of which may be addressed on Committee Stage.  However, others can only be addressed if there is a proper enforcement regime.  I read the Bill digest, which is always helpful, and I was shocked to find that 32% of commercial vehicles tested at road side checkpoints in 2011 required immediate action.  Commercial vehicles were involved in approximately 20% of fatalities while a high number of accidents resulted in serious injuries.  The larger the vehicle, the greater the risk of injury.  Such injuries can be life changing and that must be borne in mind.  Changes that are made in the interest of road safety must be thought out and we should generally support them.According to the Bill digest, there is evidence that a disproportionate number of Irish registered vehicles fail road side checks in the UK and, anecdotally, the same is the case on the Continent where there is a high level of compliance.  This is because there is a high risk of being caught and losing a business or an income.  Compliance together with enforcement of the legislation are the two key issues.  The fact that hauliers were detected in Britain shows that there is higher level of enforcement there than in Ireland.  I agree the current system, which is fragmented, cannot lead to consistency and it is necessary to have a central database to track variations in compliance levels and test outcomes in different parts of the country.  Without data, that cannot be measured whereas it is very important it is possible to measure it.There is apparently limited roadside enforcement by gardaí and infrequent multi-agency enforcement measures.  Indeed, I have been watching out for multi-agency measures, for example, in regard to the taxi system.  I have been in taxis recently and, to be honest, I do not know who passed them.  I got into one taxi where the door would not close and there were appalling and obvious defects.  When dealing with very large vehicles while there is an inadequacy in terms of enforcement and of compliance, given there is an obligation on the people who own and drive these vehicles, clearly, they are posing an unacceptable risk to other road users.  The fragmentation is not helpful and, therefore, the centralisation of supervision is a reasonable proposal.We all remember the high-profile "Prime Time" programme on the NCT, which pointed to a less than satisfactory situation, although that is something of an understatement.  Given that experience, it will be essential this process is highly supervised and regulated.  Nonetheless, I cannot understand how it is to work.  I presume there will be private sector involvement and that there may well be a competition or a tender process.  However, it would be useful if the Minister outlined how he sees this applying in practical terms as it is important we see that picture.  If it continues to be the case that people go to garages to undertake their tests and, at the same time, come back to the same garage to have their tyres repaired or carry out whatever repair the vehicle requires, there is a conflict of interest.  There is also a potential conflict of interest in terms of local authorities keeping the show on the road in terms of commercial rates and all the rest.  All of those kinds of issues have to be part of the consideration of this issue.The idea that 158 operators are supervised by 30 bodies is the kind of fragmentation we have been used to in this country and it is not an efficient way to operate.  However, I have concerns, as I had in my experience with the National Roads Authority, that this will be impenetrable for a person trying to get information from the Road Safety Authority and there will be no democratic oversight.  Those kinds of issues are very important when one is taking powers away from the local authority.  There needs to be oversight for an agency such as the RSA, for example, by parliamentary question.  While the RSA has been doing a very good job, there is always the potential for that job not to be done as well as we would like, and it is important we have this available to us.While I am supportive of this initiative, I note the commercial vehicle licensing element of the local authorities' role, which is done on an agency basis for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, is quite small in terms of motor taxation and the provision of general licences.  There is a valid concern in that we hear every week of another function that will not be carried out by the local government system.  I am in favour of radical reform - I really mean radical reform - of the local government system.  I do not want to see it done by stealth, however, but in a thoughtful way, so I am concerned that we are seeing this kind of chopping away of functions without some sort of a vision.  I accept this is a separate matter but it is important to say it.The point made by a previous speaker on the centralisation of medical cards was not a good example.  If we are to centralise something, we must be certain that when a telephone rings, somebody is there to pick it up, that people are treated in a professional manner, that the least amount of bureaucracy is involved in complying and that it is made easy for people to comply.  The last thing we want is to create problems for people who are already struggling to keep a business going.  Of any sector, the road haulage industry has been one of the most prone to businesses failing over the years, and it is important we keep in mind that where people are trying to be compliant, we help them to be compliant.The local authorities currently have officials involved in identifying and authorising testers, and it appears this function is done on a part-time basis in many local authority areas.  Can we be told if this function will be retained or transferred to the RSA, or will it be subsumed into other functions within the local authority system?  This question does matter.It appears some test centres carry out tests for heavy goods vehicles but not for light goods vehicles.  If we are going to centralise the process and make it simple, it is important this issue is dealt with.  While I suspect it will be, there is inadequate information for me to be sure this will be the case.There is always a presumption that people can do everything online but there will have to be some thought about people who do not want to do their business in that way.  The other point is that if we are taking this process away from the local government system and it is to be centrally organised, will people have to rely on the postal service or apply online, or will they have a reasonably convenient local office to which they can go?  Again, I ask the Minister to draw attention to how this will function in practice.The Bill refers to tachograph offences.  I believe there are many offences in regard to people not complying with tachograph rules but we do not know because we rarely see anyone being checked.  In the past 12 months, I saw perhaps two major checks involving the Customs Service, the Garda and social welfare officials, and not necessarily in regard to heavy goods vehicles.  When one goes to other countries, in particular the UK, one is conscious of the traffic corps being on the roads the whole time, of people being pulled in and all the rest.  This legislation will only be as good as its enforcement.Ten years ago the National Roads Authority undertook an analysis - perhaps not a very nice one - in regard to how much a fatality cost.  It came to the conclusion that a figure which could be put on it for the purposes of undertaking a cost-benefit analysis was approximately £1 million.  We can see, therefore, that a higher level of compliance will result in a financial benefit, as well as a benefit to the people who will not end up subject to these road accidents.I was surprised when I saw the plastic-style driver licence was first initiated in the early 1990s.  Europe has moved about as slowly as the iceberg that the Titanic hit.  Within the next ten years we will have this plastic card but I cannot understand why it will take that long.  It is astonishing how slowly the process moves for such a logical, small thing.I want to focus on the issue of Garda numbers given Ireland has a very lop-sided distribution of Garda resources.  I met the assistant commissioner, who told me each division operated on the basis that what one has, one holds.  The counties around the cities that have grown in recent years - I am not only referring to Dublin - have a disproportionately low number of gardaí per head of population.  My county, Kildare, is the worst nationally with one garda for every 660 people, approximately half the national average.  If the rest of the country was policed to that standard, we could let go 5,000 gardaí.  Naturally that would be ridiculous but that is the level of service we are getting.  The distribution of gardaí will be important if there is any chance of the legislation working as intended.Although there are many positive aspects to the Bill, one note of concern is that it gives a good deal of power to the Minister to bring in regulations and secondary legislation.  The absence of democratic oversight is dangerous and the wrong way to proceed with this legislation.  I would prefer to see more detail in this legislation.  It may be that some detail can be incorporated by way of amendment on Committee Stage but it is concerning.I had always understood that one was considered innocent and not guilty by assumption.  Another provision of concern in the Bill is the suggestion that if one does not produce certain documentation, one is presumed to be guilty.  I am somewhat concerned about this and I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I am pleased to be able to speak on the proposed legislation, the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Bill 2012, a fine mouthful, although I cannot say I am as pleased as previous speakers.  I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well with it, but it is more evidence of our rush to bring in legislation of all kinds to make it more difficult for people who are the providers of employment and services.  They are being banished off the land.  I am in favour of road safety and I have no wish to see any kind of accident.  That said, we need a detailed analysis of what is being done in this legislation.  It is more evidence of a takeover of power by official Ireland and nothing else.  There are too many regulations and there is excessive regulation in many areas.  If we do not stop this, there will be no national recovery.  I cannot understand how IMF and EU officials cannot see this.  For every law Europe introduces, we seem to add ten more.I salute the officers of the Irish Road Haulage Association who traverse the world and have done so for charitable works, for example, in Bosnia and other places beyond.  They do so with safety, respect and a proud Irish flag.  They are not cowboys or fly-by-night operators.  Certainly, we have cowboys and fly-by-night operators and they must be dealt with.  We should be passing appropriate legislation for them rather than this Bill.  We should introduce legislation to deal with the laundering of fuel, unlicensed hauliers and the blackguardism that goes on.Some Deputies suggest we should put a truck off the road if one of the tyre appears to peel.  Do they know anything about the weight of these lorries, the pressure they are under and the standards?  Have those who drafted this legislation ever sat behind the wheel of a truck, lay under it to change a wheel, put a jack underneath to repair it, filled it with fuel or paid for the cost of the fuel?  No.  This is the problem with Ireland today.  Officialdom has gone stark raving mad and Ministers have allowed it.This is a fine legacy left by the former Minister, Noel Dempsey.  I heard Deputy Dooley referring to it.  Mr. Noel Brett and Mr. Gay Byrne were mentioned.  I respect Gay Byrne as a broadcaster but he seems to have an eternal right to a job for life as chairman of the Road Safety Authority.  I have eight children and not one of them knows who Gay Byrne is.  We need to talk to young people.  Modern sports stars or journalists should be used to get the message across to these people.  I am referring to pedestrians and cyclists who need to be careful and understand the dangers of trucks.  A truck driver cannot have eyes and ears for everything.  Those in our schools should be educated and we should consider education policies to educate people about the dangers, especially on our under-classified roads which are not fit for trucks much of the time.  They were built for the ass and cart or the horse and cart but now there are 40 ft trucks whose drivers are finding it impossible to keep manners on them because in many cases the county councils will not force the landowners to cut the hedges under the existing laws.  We have gone mad rushing through new legislation while ignoring old legislation and common sense.  I call on the Minister of State to appeal to the Minister to revisit this.  I realise there are good initiatives relating to rural schools and rural transport and so on.  The Minister should go to the road hauliers and consult them rather than officials in the Department or the Noel Bretts and Gay Byrnes who know nothing about lorries, lorry yards or the maintenance or costs of running these businesses.   They have no clue and only put more pressure on them across the board.I salute the council officials who have done a good job in taxation over the years.  It is a retrograde step to take it away from them.  We have seen this with the HSE, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority and the medical cards.  It is a case of a repeated mess and taking away from local democracy and local people who understand what is going on.  A man approached me last week.  He had to drive a tractor he imported from Cahir in County Tipperary to the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick to get it assessed.  I mean no disrespect to the person who examined it in Limerick but they probably would not know a tractor from a bullock, but that is the way of it.  We have gone bananas.People are trying to live and stay in business but we appear to be hell-bent on putting them all out of business.  This applies to the previous Government, the Government before that and the current Government.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is in America trying to bring jobs to Ireland but we at home are on a merry-go-round with officialdom gone mad trying to close down ordinary, decent, hard-working business people.  Two or three road hauliers are going out of business each day because they cannot survive.  The are insured, have their lorries tested, have proper wages, have the tachograph in the cab and are adhering to all the legislation but they are being forced out.  Despite this, we want other officials to be appointed rather than gardaí.  There is a fancy name for such an official: a commercial roadworthiness vehicle, CRV, test operator.  I imagine this will be a civilian who will get a briefcase.  He should know everything about a truck but he would not know the engine from the mudguard at the back.  Despite this he has the power to pull in a driver and take him to a weighbridge 20 miles away although the driver may have a deadline to make on the Continent or elsewhere.  The official might believe something is wrong with the truck because he might hear a rattle or his watch might rattle or be ticking.  It is patent nonsense.  Unless we get a grip on this throughout the country, the country will go under.  I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  I am in business and self-employed.  This applies whether one is a shopkeeper, an ordinary agricultural contractor or a road haulier.  Officialdom has gone mad.  I mean no respect to the two officials sitting in the Chamber; they simply do not know.  We should put these officials in these businesses for at least one or two weeks per year in order that they would understand the pain, pressure and the realpolitik of keeping businesses afloat and some sense of sanity would prevail while dealing with officialdom.Our tractors were always assessed by Customs and Excise and that must be the way.  Now one must drive a tractor 50 or 60 miles to a centre to meet an official.  If it is wet, he will not come out in case he gets wet and one must drive home and come back again the following day.  It is crazy and not good enough and we must cry halt.I have no wish to have a go at Gay Byrne or Noel Brett but where were they when we were designing our wonderful motorways?  All of this took place during the past ten or 15 years when they were in power with the former Minister, Mr. Dempsey.  They built a motorway from Dublin to Cork without even a rest station.  One cannot pull in to take care of the basic necessities.  Members will know what I am talking about but it is a wet night and I will not go into it.  I am simply referring to the basic essentials.  Truck drivers are being treated like slaves.  They have no place to stop to get cigarettes or some food.  I condemn those responsible out of hand as well as the National Roads Authority, NRA.  The way I describe it, we got rid of the IRA but now we have the NRA and it is almost as bad.We will need the Senator from America to come back and oversee peace talks to get these officials to see some sense rather than carry briefcases.  They should get out and understand what is going on in real Ireland.  They should understand that people must generate business and must have respect for the laws.  If we keep piling on the laws, every road haulier will need a solicitor to interpret all the legislation and to educate their drivers as well.  These drivers have licences and have paid an increasing level of fees each year for the various tests they must do.  One would think they were driving an aeroplane.  Pilots are hardly as well-trained as these drivers, and rightly so.  I am not suggesting we should cut short any legislation but unless we get some common sense back into the system in the country, we are going nowhere.  I say as much proudly.  I hope the Minister of State will consult the Minister and table amendments to the legislation because there is good in it.We had "Prime Time Investigates".  It has become the gospel of the land now.  However, we saw what that programme did to a company in my county, Tipperary.  The Department would not issue a licence because of "Prime Time Investigates".  People should know that there have been some shoddy practices in "Prime Time Investigates".  It might sound funny but it is not.  It is the gospel according to St. Jude.  I am unsure who is the patron saint of transport but I hope he comes down from heaven to help us.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The system in Ireland has strayed from reality.  They do not understand.  All the officials should be sent out to these businesses to understand the effect of this measure.  What impact assessment was done to determine how many road hauliers this measure would put out of business?  An impact assessment was not done.  We are bringing in legislative measure after legislative measure, smothering the people responsible in paper and to hell or to Connacht with it, to quote Cromwell.  It is beyond a joke, and I am sorry if the Acting Chairman has that view.Regarding "Prime Time Investigates", I intend raising this in the committee when we come back after dealing with the other report about the priest and others because they were blackguarding.  They hired people to try to condemn good businesses.  Blackguarding went on in that regard.  We need to examine all those issues.The Government hopes to raise €4.5 million as a result of this measure.  That is wonderful.  It hopes to have a cap of €45 for all tests.  The €4.5 million will never be earned but the €45 will increase to €450.  I can guarantee that as sure as it will get dark tonight because that is what has happened in the past.I am disappointed to hear people condemn the NCT and DOE testers in local areas.  They have to operate to high standards, and people can drive their vehicles to those centres but under this measure they will all have to come to Dublin and congest the traffic even more to get tested.  We think big is powerful but it is not.  We must be realistic.  This system cannot be taken into one conglomerate.  We should have learned by now that big is not wonderful.A company in my town, Plant Care Ltd, went out of business last Thursday.  I thank that company for the employment it provided.  A receiver was sent in because it could not keep going.  That business gave great employment and sponsorship to many local clubs, including in Longford town and Longford.  It provided a great deal of employment and many services also but it has gone to the wall.  That business is only one of many that have gone to the wall.  I meet single hauliers every day of the week who simply gave up the ghost.  They could not bring their wife or secretary in the cab with them to deal with all the certification that was required.  Most of the trucks now have to have computers on board.  We have to stop somewhere.  Safety regulations for brakes, tyres, chassis, steering and so on are vital but not for all the Mickey Mouse nonsense that is going on.  It is keeping fellows in employment.  As I said earlier, a fellow carrying a briefcase comes into my business to test the machine but he cannot start it.  I have to have a driver to start it for him.  These people would not know how to get into the cab.  We must have realism in this matter.The "Prime Time Investigates" programme exposed the NCT centres, and rightly so if wrongdoing occurred, but "Prime Time Investigates" is not the programme we all thought it was; it is on the floor now.  All I am asking for is fair play for business people, some of whom have been in business for 50 and 60 years.  They started off with a horse and cart, moved on to the Comer trucks, then to rigid trucks and then to articulated trucks.  They gave employment and took the risks with the banks.  If we do away with all the risk takers, how will we recover?  Those people did it.  They can do it but they need fair play.  The lifeblood is being squeezed out of them because they cannot get the bonds if an issue arises with their licence.  They cannot get overdrafts from the banks that would help them to keep in business.  These people are providing employment.  What about all the families who were depending on Plant Care Ltd., the company that went out of business last Thursday, and the five, six or ten companies that went to the wall since last Thursday?The madness has got to stop.  I am all for road safety but where are the heroes now?  The former Minister, Noel Dempsey, ran off like a scalded cat.  He designed the motorways with his officials, Gay Byrne and Noel Brett and left us without rest areas.  They should have been charged with reckless behaviour for building motorways without a place for truckers or car drivers to stop, just as some Ministers should have been charged with reckless behaviour for the damage done to this country but they will not be touched.  They are the untouchables.  I cannot wait for Deputy Shane Ross to publish his book about the untouchables.  I hope he mentions a few from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the National Roads Authority, NRA, because one cannot get through to those people.  One cannot talk to them.  I have seen where the NRA will not allow businesses develop in south Tipperary because they will not give permission for an exit onto the road yet one can see the most dastardly things hanging out over motorways in other counties.  An investigation should be done in that regard also.  I have no faith in the NRA.  I have less faith in the RSA.  I wish this Minister well but I had no faith in the previous Minister.I congratulate the county councils for the job they have done but it seems everything is being taken from them.  They are closing by stealth, and to hell with it.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, Big Phil, tried to amalgamate South Tipperary and North Tipperary County Councils.  The Deputy and myself will be representing one constituency on the next occasion.  Those are bullying tactics.  Decent public servants who do good work and provide a good service are being thrown to the wind without any assurance as to where they will be located.On the question of Garda resources, I regularly meet Garda inspectors who have to police these vehicles.  I have no problem stopping for a garda but I have a problem stopping for someone with a briefcase because he could be a kidnapper.  He will not have a badge on his arm and there will be no blue lights flashing.  I do not know what we will call these special people.  I believe they will become an endangered species.  I respect all the laws.  I never break laws nor encourage anyone to break them but truckers cannot adhere to this measure.  The Garda tells me that in certain areas they do not have a squad car yet the Minister for Defence can provide helicopters and hire Army planes to watch fellows cutting turf.  They will send helicopters after those of us in the lorries to see if the back doors are closed.  This is patent nonsense.  We are persecuting ordinary people who want to be law-abiding, pay their way, get employment and generate business.  We are giving responsibility for all of that to the officials.  We then send them off with a fat retirement pension and then rehire them, regardless of any investigation or report that has been done.  It is like the amalgamation of my constituency, North and South Tipperary, we have two retired officials from the Department.  If they are retired they should be playing golf.  They were probably playing golf when they were working.  That is the way things have gone, and it is not funny.  It appears everyone in these jobs has to be a retired official.  A layman is never considered for any of these jobs.I am speaking honestly.  The Minister should go after the diesel launderers because the fellows who use the laundered diesel are also using defective tyres and defective vehicles but some of those people are the untouchables, and people are afraid to confront them.  They have to be confronted and stopped from undermining the good practices of ordinary, decent road hauliers, their employees, their families and the local garages and businesses that support the trucking companies yet we want to move responsibility for that area to some big place, perhaps inside Tallaght Hospital.  That is what we like to do.  Everything must be near the M50.  We forget about rural Ireland.  It is time we got back to basics and to rural Ireland.  We must understand who wants to live in rural Ireland, create a job for himself or herself, provide employment and pay taxes.  The Government will pay the pensions for all these officials who go off with hundreds of thousands of euro.  When it gets too hot in this kitchen the people are sent off to Europe because they have too much to tell, like the bankers and others.  I will not name any officials.  I hope this measure will be consigned to the dustbin.

Fáiltím roimh an deis seo an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála.  Tá na mílte oibrithe faoi láthair faoi bhrú uafásach sa tír seo agus táimid ag iarraidh iad a chosaint tríd an Bhille seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  I welcome the opportunity to use this Sinn Féin Private Members' time to bring forward this legislation.  It is timely that the legislation is before the House today, May Day, which is most associated with celebrating the contribution workers have given to society, remembering the sacrifices they have made and recommitting ourselves to equality and social justice.Despite the negative views of the Taoiseach today I am hopeful the Government will support our Bill.  We remain committed to working with all the parties in this Dáil and hope they bring forward amendments which will improve the Bill as it goes through the Dáil.  As the Minister is aware, there is a wall of redundancies hitting this State.  For most people redundancies are a desperate situation.  It means an initial fall in income.  It also means that people's future income security crashes and the financial commitments they must meet cause great stress for those individuals.  In addition, we have had an economic shock to the State where a large number of businesses are unwilling to fulfil their responsibilities to these workers, which means that thousands of workers are being exposed economically.  In addition we have a State which is creaking under the pressure of the sheer volume of redundancies going through the process.  Workers across the State have engaged in prolonged sit-ins and campaigns to secure the rights to which they are entitled.Research by Vision-net has found that the number of companies becoming insolvent exceeds the number of businesses being created.  We must remember that behind every company closure lie desperate individual circumstances.  Many employers have struggled to continue in business through the most adverse economic circumstances, while many employees have accepted pay cuts and changes to rostering arrangements and business practices in an effort to keep their companies afloat.  Although many business owners have done the right thing by their workers when their companies have closed, some companies have not given employees the minimum period of notice and have undermined the rights and just expectations of their workers.  All parties in the House have endorsed motions in support of those who have lost jobs in a number of companies.  The Labour Party, supported by Fine Gael, tabled a motion in the Seanad last September calling for redundancy rights to be upheld and condemning the disgraceful actions against workers in the TalkTalk company.  Since then workers made redundant in La Senza, Vita Cortex, Game, Wilson Publishing and many other companies have engaged in disputes with their former employers.Sinn Féin has introduced this Bill in response to a lack of action on this issue.  Its provisions address some of the shortcomings in the current legislation pertaining to redundancy and are consistent with the need to protect the rights of workers and ensure employers meet their responsibilities.  The Bill reflects the stated positions of all political parties and while it will not address every problem surrounding redundancy rights, it will resolve certain issues related to entitlements, periods of notice and timely resolution of payments.The legislation seeks to extend the period of notification in collective redundancies from 30 days to 60 for companies with a workforce of between 20 and 99 employees and from 30 days to 90 for companies with a workforce of 100 or more employees.  The 90 day notice period is consistent with the approach taken in the North and other jurisdictions in Europe.  A 90 day notice period would also allow for negotiations to take place, enable workers to plan for their future and facilitate businesses in examining options for trading out of their current problems.  The extension of the period of notice would not be an onerous imposition on employers and is standard in many other European Union countries.The Bill also addresses the issue of access to the timely payment of redundancy entitlements.  In February the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, claimed that a new computer system would expedite the processing of redundancy payments and reduce the average processing period to six weeks.   While this is all very well, it highlights that payments of benefits to individuals who have been made redundant are not protected in the same way as payments to businesses are protected.  Why should businesses be paid before individuals who have been made redundant?  It is not good enough that 29,000 redundancy payment claims remain in the system.The average waiting time for dealing with contested cases in the Employment Appeals Tribunal is between 70 and 80 weeks.  The Bill seeks to address the issue of timely access to the tribunal and the Labour Court by introducing a maximum period of 60 days within which a case must be heard.  In the event that a case is not heard within this period, the adjudicative body would be required to notify the Minister and provide reasons for the delay in hearing the case.  The Minister would then issue a statement on the matter within 30 days of notification and publish further updates at intervals of 30 days until the matter had been rectified.  A similar provision is made in respect of determinations by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court and would require that entitlements be paid to workers from the insolvency fund within 60 days.  This provision seeks to improve the operations of the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, enhance their accountability to the Minister and ensure ministerial accountability to the people he or she serves.While Sinn Féin recognises that the Minister has made proposals on employment rights bodies, the rights provided for in the Bill stand on their merits and would enhance his proposals.  The setting of targets is positive for all concerned as it allows for the measurement of success in administration.  The Bill also seeks to address the anomaly identified in debates on the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.  In cases where a company ceases trading but does not enter insolvency workers are left in a legal limbo and cannot automatically access funding from the insolvency fund until their employer's business has been forced into bankruptcy by creditors.  This can be a lengthy and costly process and, in some cases, creditors will not pursue insolvency because the business does not have visible assets.  The Bill will give workers in companies which are insolvent in all but name an entitlement to apply for payment from the insolvency fund within 60 days of a company ceasing trading.The provisions of the Bill are limited to addressing some of the experiences of and concerns raised by workers.  Sinn Féin recognises that it does not address the totality of the issue of employee protection.  We ask the Government to address the matter of ex gratia payments and ensure employers honour agreements made with workers in order that employees of organisations and companies such as Lagan Brick and Vita Cortex are not forced to take the actions on which they have embarked.  It is incredible that individuals in the companies in question are still engaged in sit-ins almost halfway through 2012.  All of us have a basic expectation that agreements will be honoured.There is merit in examining the issue of lump sum payments and offering greater flexibility and alternative means of compensating workers who have been made redundant.  In other European countries, including Germany, workers who are made redundant are given a weekly payment approximating to their wages for a fixed period.  This approach which is complemented by training better prepares people to return to the workforce.  Workers should be given a choice as to the type of arrangement for their redundancy payment, whether a weekly payment or a lump sum.Expediting redundancy payments would also help workers who wish to participate in buy-outs of businesses because employees would have the capital required to engage in a buy-out before their company closed.  I ask the Minister to consider all the options I have outlined and produce proposals on each of them.Compliance with legislation and the determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court must also be addressed because without enforcement, such determinations are useless.  I ask the Minister to address this issue through regulation.I am confident that enactment of the legislation would safeguard and enforce the rights and entitlements of workers.  It would allow workers to return to employment and promote business start-ups.  It would not impose an onerous cost on good employees but would tackle cases of abusive employers.  The Bill reflects a growing consensus that the Oireachtas must address problems such as those that have arisen in TalkTalk, La Senza, Game, Vita Cortex and Lagan Brick.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	310	As this is May Day, I extend greetings to workers, working families and the unemployed.  It is pertinent that we are debating the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill on International Workers' Day.  It is not a coincidence that Sinn Féin chose today to introduce the Bill because we are proud of our socialist politics and history of supporting workers in struggle, north, south, east and west.  My party has never shied away from supporting workers who are struggling for justice anywhere in the world, whether in support of the Dunnes Stores strikers in Dublin in the 1980s, striking dockers in Liverpool or Ford workers in Belfast.  Our politics are about providing solutions for the challenges that face workers in today's climate of austerity.I commend Unite, MANDATE and SIPTU on their expressions of support for this Bill.The purpose of this Bill is to enhance the rights of workers who are facing great difficulties in accessing their basic entitlements in the current climate.  It will lengthen the notification period in collective redundancies from 30 to 60 days where companies have 20 to 99 employees, and from 30 to 90 days where companies have more than 100 employees.  It puts in place a maximum period of 60 days after a worker applies to the Labour Court to have his or her case heard.  It will also put in place a maximum period of 60 days after a determination of the Labour Court to have the worker's entitlements paid out under the insolvency fund.  This Bill will ensure workers in companies that are insolvent in all but name are entitled to apply for payment under the insolvency fund after their company has ceased trading for more than 60 days.The Minister is wrong to attack this Bill, as he did today.  He claims the proposals are of limited value with regard to the period of notice.  He should try saying that to those workers in TalkTalk and he should explain his misrepresentation.  The absence of this legislation has created a nightmare for thousands of workers who have faced redundancy in recent years.  Many of these workers have taken it upon themselves to take action to highlight their plight and demand this Government uphold their rights.  I extend solidarity greetings to Vita Cortex workers in Cork who remain in occupation, the workers in Lagan Bricks, Game and La Senza and thousands who never make the headlines.  I had the opportunity to meet the Game workers recently.  The situation facing these workers and their families highlights the need for people to join trade unions.  We might all have differences with the leadership of unions at different times, but they are the last line of defence for many families and their communities.  I encourage people to join trade unions.Today's economic recession is being used by the current Government and its allies in industry to introduce anti-worker practices.  An example of this is the Connolly Shoes dispute in Dún Laoghaire, whereby €85,000 was awarded by the Labour Court to the staff, yet there are no means to force the company to pay.  The company has simply changed the name above the door and continued to trade.  The union is confident the courts will find in favour of the workers, yet the company will not have to pay one penny as it is the taxpayer who will pick up the tab for the €85,000.  We are all aware of how tight money is in today's climate, and we hear from the captains of industry of the need to tighten our belts and cut back on public spending.  However, in the absence of this Bill, it is the taxpayer who bails out these same companies every day.  It is unjust, uneconomic and unacceptable that taxpayers' money has to be used like this.I urge the Government parties to support this Bill, in particular the Labour Party, which receives much of its financial support from the trade unions.  That party has an opportunity today to redeem itself and to strengthen the rights of workers who are faced with redundancy.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Ba mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo.  Today is May Day, a day when workers, trade unionists and those who struggle for a better world for ordinary people remember the fights of the past, the victories, the losses, the revolutions and the counter-revolutions, the great men and the great women.  It is a day we in Sinn Féin mark and a day that always causes me to pause and think of the great things that have been achieved by working people and the many things we have yet to wrestle from those who seek to hold us back from human progress in order that they can pursue profit and power.Today those people are often referred to as the 1%.  They are those who are €4.1 billion better off this year in Ireland, while others struggle to pay their bills and have less than €100 at the end of the month.  They are backed up by the servile political elite.  As Connolly, Ireland's greatest leader of working people, said, Ireland is nothing without its people.  Its people are the working people who do not earn massive wages or dodge paying their fair share.  Nothing speaks more to the need to protect our people than the situation we see throughout the country, where workers who lose their jobs are left with nothing to show for their service and often great loyalty to their place of employment.  Many employers seek to take advantage in the bad times of the temporary docility of Irish workers, and cast out these workers with little more than a text message or an e-mail.  They have awoken the Irish worker and this spirit of fighting back can be seen in the resolve of the workers at La Senza, Game, Lagan Brick and Vita Cortex.  Their fight is the fight of workers throughout Ireland, who know that they could be next.  The solidarity shown to these workers' sit-ins is undeniable evidence of this.The State must act to prevent a situation where workers cannot get the redundancy they deserve from their former employers.  Their mistreatment must not be continued further by the actions of a State which at this moment is telling them that they are not worth anything, their hard work is not appreciated and they should never feel secure.  Our modest demand this evening is not asking the earth, but simply some redress for some workers who are not in a position to avail of their deserved redundancy from their former employers and who must turn to the State.  This Bill will not address all the issues relating to workers' rights and redundancy but we believe it is an important Bill designed to protect and enhance the rights of some workers experiencing great difficulty at this time.  The Labour Party proposed some similarly motivated measures last September in the Seanad.  It was passed but nothing has come of it, in spite of tacit support from the Minister, Deputy Bruton.Workers are being denied the entitlements they have won, and the State must act to make available redundancy payments to which they are entitled, as well as laying down requirements that they will not be left to fend for themselves for a protracted period while a decision is being made.  This is a simple, modest Bill to help some workers who are being left in the lurch due to a failure to legislate to protect them in these changing times.  I commend it to the House and I ask the Labour Party to consider its heritage, those oft mentioned Labour values, and vote for this motion to support workers on this international day of solidarity and re-dedication to the cause of progress and humanity.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	312	A number of anomalies have been highlighted over recent years in regard to notice and redundancy as the recession has begun to make serious inroads into employment levels.  There have been instances in my constituency where it required considerable pressure and outside intervention to ensure the workers who were being made redundant received their due entitlements.  I have also had representations from workers who have been let go from smaller companies which have allegedly ceased to operate but whose owners have established themselves under a new name within a short period.  In some of these cases, the workers who were let go found their former employers were refusing to pay them any redundancy money on the basis they allegedly could not afford to do so.  They then placed the workers concerned in the same position as other creditors who were also making claims against companies that had nominally ceased to exist but whose owners were still in business.Both of these issues need to be addressed: the claim of workers to be compensated for the loss of their jobs, and for suppliers and others to be paid for their goods and services.  It certainly ought not be possible for people to avoid their legal and financial obligations by ceasing to trade under one name only to reappear overnight under a different name.  There was also, of course, the La Senza case in which there was a deliberate and cynical attempt by those responsible for running the company in administration to take advantage of legal loopholes not only to avoid paying redundancy but also to avoid paying wages owed to the workers for the time they had worked under considerable stress, given the fact that they knew their jobs were more than likely gone.  Only the fact that they were not prepared to take the way they were being treated lying down forced the company liquidators, KPMG, to come to some terms with them.  I commend them for this.  The fact that it was only the direct action of the workforce, with the widespread support of the general public, that brought about the improved offer illustrates the need for the law to be changed in order to address such cases and avoid a repeat.  That is why I urge all sides of the House, including Government Deputies who spoke out on the La Senza issue and about similar cases, to support the Sinn Féin proposals.There is an ongoing problem in the Vita Cortex plant in Cork where workers have been in occupation for the past four months.  Again, the owners of the company are claiming an inability to pay, whereas the workers' representatives have pointed both to previous offers from Mr. Jack Ronan and the fact that NAMA had apparently offered to release sufficient funds to facilitate proper severance terms.The point ought to be that the legislation should establish proper procedures rather than leaving us open to similar moves by employers to avoid paying proper redundancy terms.  The only way to ensure this is to bring forward proper legislation, which is why I commend the Bill to the House.

I have talked to people who worked in Waterford Crystal, La Senza, TalkTalk, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, Game and Wilson Publishing and used this Chamber to publicise their cases.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is one of the people who replied to my queries and tried to make sense of some of the decisions taken by the employers of these workers.  All of the workers involved in these closures were angry and frustrated.  In many cases, they had met their job targets and worked extremely hard.  They had worked for profitable companies, the finances of which were, in some cases, exported abroad, yet they were told there was no money for redundancy payments.  They asked us what we could do to help.  As legislators, we raised these anomalies with the Minister and the Minister of State on a number of occasions and asked how some employers could get away with this sort of thing in today's world.Other speakers have reminded the House that this is May Day.  I think of the 1913 lock-out.  What was it about?  It was about workers trying to secure basic rights such as the right to join a trade union and have basic working conditions.  Those workers were of a different generation and did different jobs and we like to think conditions have improved since, yet many of today's workers are in the same situation.  Some were informed by telephone or email that they were being made redundant.  Some heard it in the media, while others were informed by heavies.  One young woman told me she had been surrounded by guys as she was opening the shop front and told the business was closed.  That is how she was officially informed that she had lost her job.  She was trying to keep the shop shutters down, thinking the men were about to rob her employer's business.  She was trying to protect her employer's stock and premises.  When she telephoned head office, she was told, "Yes, your job is gone."  That is not acceptable and  I do not believe anyone in the House would disagree with me.  People listening at home do not want to see that type of society emerging.  That is why Sinn Féin drafted this legislation.The Minister and others have said it is a waste of time or does not go far enough.  Perhaps the Minister is working on legislation.  When I raised this issue on a previous occasion, I said this was not just an Irish issue.  It is a European issue because many of the companies involved cross frontiers.  We need a joint response from reasonable people in power in Europe or who work in the area of workers' rights.  We need to come up with responses to this issue.Sinn Féin was asked by people who had been made redundant if it could do something to improve the position.  Some cases have been successfully resolved.  Other people are still trying to secure their basic rights and redundancy payments.  They said they did not want waffle but to see legislation.  That is what we tried to do.  There is an onus on all of us, as legislators, to come up with solutions to this issue.  To rubbish our attempt or dismiss the Bill without an explanation is a retrograde step.Will the Minister of State explain to those waiting more than 76 weeks for an Employment Appeals Tribunal hearing why there is no value in holding the Department or the Minister to account for that delay?  Is that acceptable?  I realise there are huge difficulties and that many are becoming unemployed, but if the waiting time is 76 weeks, clearly the tribunal needs more resources.  People should not have to wait that length of time.  Perhaps the Minister of State might tell workers who have been given four weeks notice of redundancy that a longer notification period would be of little value.  Can someone explain this?The purpose of the Bill is to enhance and enshrine the rights of workers by ensuring anyone who is made redundant could have his or her claim for entitlements dealt with quickly and processed without undue complications.  Most Members of the House would share that aspiration.It is important to remind ourselves that the significant profits made by companies during the so-called boom years were further boosted by the tax incentives and generous grants made available to encourage businesses and multinationals to establish a base of operations in Ireland.  This should not be forgotten when we examine the fate of workers during these harsher times.When people ask how companies can get away with what they do, they look to other things people seem to be getting away with.  When people see houses being repossessed, they ask who got us into this mess and if they are being brought to book.  When someone loses a job, the effect is felt by his or her children, in his or her relationships and by the security of his or her home.   The Bill is about helping and supporting those who find themselves in that difficult position.I am not talking about something that is abstract and that I have not experienced.  Like many others in this House or listening at home, I was made redundant, but I did not get just five minutes notice.  My employer followed due process.  I was made redundant approximately 30 years ago.  Surely the conditions and rights of workers should improve not disimprove with time, which is what seems to be happening.  The evidence is clear given the frequency with which groups of workers come to the Visitors Gallery to give us their story.  They go to all Members seeking answers on how this can happen when it did not happen in one's father's or grandfather's time.  One could ask how we can allow this to happen.  The purpose of the legislation is to improve the conditions of workers and their families.  It is clear that the law is not adequate if hardworking staff can be sacked with immediate effect, have wages withheld and be offered no redundancy.  That is the message we are sending from this side of the House.If the Government does not accept the Bill we have introduced the challenge lies with it to do something.  Other speakers have indicated that they hope the Labour Party or Fine Gael does this or that.  I do not care who votes for the Bill but I do want to see a framework emerge from the discussion and that we will not go back but go forward in order that conditions for workers improve, not disimprove.  Likewise, I wish to see wages improve, not disimprove.  I realise we are in difficult times but I wish to see improvements in the situation of workers.The most recent figures available indicate there is a backlog of approximately 29,000 statutory redundancy claims, yet the Government tells us that claims submitted after October 2011 will be resolved within six weeks.  No deadline has been set to resolve the existing backlog and, to compound matters further, where cases are contested the average waiting period for claims to be heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, is 76 weeks in Dublin and 80 weeks elsewhere.  One could ask whether that is acceptable for one to be in such a position.  It is necessary to resolve the situation in order for redundancy packages to be made available.  I accept there are difficulties and pressures but we must adapt and seek to invest extra resources in order to speed up the processing of claims.  I look forward to the Minister's reply to the debate to hear what exactly will be done to resolve the current unacceptable and scandalous delay in processing claims by the State's statutory agencies.The purpose of the Bill is to enhance and enshrine the rights of workers by ensuring anyone who is unfortunate enough to be made redundant can have the processing of his or her claim and entitlements done quickly and without undue complications.  The Bill would also ensure that workers who have been made redundant by a company which has been declared insolvent can claim their entitlements under the insolvency fund.It is important to remind ourselves that the significant profits made by companies during the so-called boom years were further boosted by the tax incentives and generous grants that were made available to multinationals.  Companies have come to this country, used the available resources and supports and then treated their workers in the manner described.  That is the big scandal in this regard.  Many workers have met the targets of the company and worked long hours, which led to the accrual of big profits.  Some of the companies in the retail sector that were mentioned closed just after Christmas.  Their staff worked long hours and did hard work.  During the Christmas period in particular there is a lot of pressure on staff.  They saw the money coming into the stores they were running.  Many of those made redundant were not just workers, they were involved in the management of the stores and knew the profits that were being made, yet they were met by the heavies on the door.We must be clear that regardless of the difficulties business faces in these harsh economic times, there is simply no excuse for Irish workers to be treated in this way.  If hard-working workers can be sacked with immediate effect, have wages withheld and be offered no redundancy it is clear that the law is not adequate.  The challenge for the Government is to act and ensure there are no more cases such as La Senza, Vita Cortex or Lagan Brick.  I have met with groups of workers from most of those companies.  I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and other Members of the House have done likewise.  Those workers are seeking answers.  With all its faults, the Bill can contribute to the debate.  I pay tribute to all those involved in framing the legislation.It is significant that we are discussing the Bill on May Day.  It is not insignificant that many years ago workers went on strike in this city to prove their rights.  They would not be ground down.  Many young people who have been through this process have emerged bitter and frustrated but they have also seen another side of the remains of the Celtic tiger.  Clearly, they are not happy with the situation and not impressed with our lack of answers on how we can improve their situation.  The downside of tonight's debate is that we will perhaps see others going through the motions in terms of what will be done.  Timescales must be forthcoming from the Minister.  We must be able to deliver.  I do not wish to see another group of workers arrive in the House in a similar situation.  Their presence would give rise to sympathy for the terrible effect on such and such a family and wonder as to how a particular family would be able to retain their house.  We would say how terrible it is that they will have to wait 56 weeks and suggest we might reduce the wait to 50 weeks.  The situation is unacceptable.  Extra resources must be made available.  Other aspects of the Bill must be examined to improve the lot of workers.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14391	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I am proud to be present today because it is the first anniversary of the announcement by the then president of the Labour Party, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, of his candidacy for the office of President of Ireland.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will quote from his statement of that day:The Labour Party is the oldest party in Ireland and was founded in the year before one of the greatest confrontations between labour and capital in the history of the Irish State, the great lock-out in Dublin of 1913.He goes on to say:What was then a poverty stricken and vulnerable movement of labour sought to organise against a version of capitalism that refused the most basic rights to workers, including the very right to organise.  That confrontation required courage, tenacity, solidarity and, above all, a commitment to class and history beyond the short-term challenges.  We should never forget that.  To this day we are the beneficiaries of the struggle of the labour movement of 1913.  Moreover, as their heirs we are required to make an analysis of our own difficult times to craft a strategy and to deliver our view of an alternative society with a sustainable and productive connection between economy and society in the institutions that can deliver it.That man, thankfully, is now President of Ireland.  I am proud to be here to say we are continuing, to the best of our ability, on his legacy and vision.On the legislation, and that particular vision, given the day that is in it, I was glad to see the pupils of the Presentation primary school of Doneraile in the Gallery because we must have regard to their future.  It is precisely in the vision set out by persons dating back to 1913, and through persons like President Michael D. Higgins, that such narrative continues.  We do our best to ensure there is a future for those children.The plight of employees in the current economic environment is foremost in the deliberations of Government as it seeks to stimulate the creation of jobs and a return to economic growth.  Various high-profile cases that have been widely reported in the media highlight the precarious nature of employment in some sectors at present and the need to ensure vulnerable employees are treated fairly by employers and their complaints adequately adjudicated by the appropriate employment rights bodies of the State.No doubt the proposed Bill under discussion here this evening is well intended.  However, it is impractical in its scope and in terms of what it seeks to achieve.  Ultimately, it could serve only to expose the taxpayer and employers to additional burdens while also, ironically, acting as a chill factor to the creation of vitally necessary new employment in the State.  We need only go back to one of the original EU directives of 1998 in this area which notes the need "for balanced economic and social development" within the EU.The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the processing of claims under the redundancy payments scheme and the insolvency payments scheme.  The insolvency payments scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and is designed to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  Such entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and certain pension contributions.  The scheme comprises a one-off payment in respect of outstanding debts to employees in respect of their legitimate employment entitlements subject to certain limits.The insolvency payments scheme and the redundancy payments scheme are two separate schemes, but they are both paid from the social insurance fund.  In 2011, €18.5 million was paid from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees.The Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of an employer in respect of most amounts paid under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 - the House will forgive me if this sounds technical, but I want to answer each of the points addressed in the Bill.  The distribution of the assets to creditors, including the Minister, is subject to the legislation and rules governing the winding-up of companies.  While an insolvent company, by definition, cannot meet its liabilities, the level of assets available for distribution can vary greatly.  The Minister may receive a dividend or be paid in full if there are sufficient funds in the liquidation/receivership.  All reimbursements made to the Minister by the liquidator from the assets of the company are returned to the social insurance fund.Sinn Féin, in proposing this Bill, seeks to widen the scope of insolvency to effectively allow an employee to render a company insolvent, by amending a provision of the 1984 Act.  The legislation currently in place provides for the recognition of companies becoming insolvent in circumstances such as where the employer has been adjudicated bankrupt; where the employer has filed a petition for, or has executed, a deed of arrangement within the meaning of section 4 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1887; where the employer has died and his or her estate, being insolvent, is being administered in accordance with the rules set out in Part I of the First Schedule to the Succession Act 1965; where the employer is a company, a winding up order is made or a resolution for voluntary winding up is passed with respect to it; where a receiver or manager of an undertaking is duly appointed, or possession is taken, by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by any floating charge, of any property of the company comprised in or subject to the charge; and where the employer is of a class or description specified in regulations under section 4(2) of this Act which are for the time being in force and the circumstances specified in the regulations as regards employers of such class or description obtain in relation to him.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14391	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I appreciate that and thank my colleagues.  I want to ensure we address the legislation before us.The current legislation also ensures that insolvency payments are paid to employees in respect of unpaid debts, such as wages and holiday pay, from the social insurance fund and protects employees' entitlements in the event of an insolvency.  Liquidation, the most common status pertaining to insolvency, is a permanent irreversible condition whereas the trading status of a company may change significantly depending on its circumstances.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to include a new category regarding the cessation of trading as part of the insolvency payments scheme.On the proposed amendment of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, I am satisfied the current provisions, contained in section 7 of the Act, are sufficient for this purpose.  The current legislation facilitates access to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the proposed amendment of section 9 is not necessary, given the reform process underway in respect of the employment rights adjudication bodies of the State.Sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, as amended, make it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory minimum 30-day employee information and consultation period.  The existing legislation provides for a range of sanctions to be applied against an employer where he or she fails to meet the information and consultation obligations under the Act, whereby failure to comply with section 9 on failure to consult or section 10 on failure to provide certain information, may result in a fine of up to €5,000.  Section 12 of the Act makes it mandatory for an employer to notify the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of his or her intention to create collective redundancies at least 30 days prior to the first dismissal taking effect.As I have indicated, while the thrust behind the legislation may be well intended, ultimately, this Bill is impractical and crucially may expose the taxpayer and the wider economy to major unintended consequences. There are two main difficulties with the Bill.  The 90-day consultation period for large companies is unrealistic and is inconsistent with the flexibility needed by companies to make decisions on restructuring and change.  The one certainty is that by imposing a consultation period as long as 90 days, the rule will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Equally, it could involve a prolonged period of uncertainty for employees, some of whom may be discouraged from remaining with a particular employer in what would be an artificially extended period of doubt.The proposed period of 90 days is significantly greater than in most other EU member states.  Significantly, the UK's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills is also actively evaluating the relevance of the continued application of the 90-day provision in the context of its own economic circumstances.The proposal surrounding the circumstances of a company ceasing trading and the granting of redundancy payments is overly simplistic and potentially lets the employer off the hook for what he or she should be rightfully paying by way of redundancy payments.  The proposal has the potential to encourage abuse by employers and will expose the taxpayer to costs that he or she should not have to bear.I ask the House to bear in mind those companies that are operating outside of this jurisdiction.  It must be also recognised that several of the cases that have given rise to this Bill concern a small number of intractable scenarios where sudden wind-ups have occurred as the result of court orders, many of which have been extra-jurisdictional, typically in the UK, and no consultation or information period whatsoever - be it 30 days or 90 days - takes place.  An extended notification period to employees in such difficult and atypical circumstances would be of limited use in seeking to improve the circumstances of affected employees.  The existing 30 day information and consultation period and the 30 day notification period to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have served the State well for more than 30 years and neither employer nor employee representatives have ever sought their amendment.  This is because, in the majority of normal collective redundancy situations, employers comply with the required information and consultation period, specifically that no dismissals take effect within a 30 day period.In fact, in practice, the notice period provided in proposed collective redundancies very often exceeds the minimum statutory provision.  A representative sample of redundancy notifications received by the Minister in 2012 shows that a majority of employees in collective redundancy situations already receive in excess of 30 days' notice that redundancies are planned for the company.  More than 65% of the notifications provided for a minimum period of six weeks before the first redundancy was due to occur, while 50% provided for a minimum period of two months before the first redundancy was due to take place.  Even in redundancy situations that did not provide for more than the minimum 30 day information and consultation period for some employees, the redundancies were often proposed on a phased basis, with many employees receiving longer notice of the planned redundancies.Existing legislative provisions contained in the Protection of Employment Act 1977 allow for National Employment Rights Authority inspectors, as authorised officers of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to carry out inspections to establish whether the Act is being complied with.  I would encourage any employees who believe their employer has not complied with the requirements of the legislation to make a complaint to the authority under the provisions of the Act.The Government is strongly committed to the protection of employees and the enhancement of their employment rights.  This commitment is most in evidence in the reform of the statutory workplace relations structures and processes initiated by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  He is committed to delivering a world class workplace relations service.  His main aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period of time.  Substantial progress has already been delivered in this regard.  A key element of the next phase of reform will be the delivery of a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision makers.I am aware I have gone beyond my allocated time, so I will leave it at that.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the proposal by colleagues opposite and on the general area of employee protection.  Members on all sides of the House are anxious to ensure the protection of employees is paramount in our employment relations law.  That concern is not exclusive to any particular party or group, although we may have different approaches to it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has gone through the technical intricacies of the Bill and I will not attempt to match him in that regard.  Instead, I will refer to a particular example that is relevant in the context of this discussion.Last Friday I attended a dinner hosted by Arklow Chamber of Commerce which was sponsored by two companies, Arklow Shipping and Servier Industries Limited.  The latter is a French biopharmaceutical company which has been established for some years in Arklow.  It is a foundation whose president, Dr. Servier, is over 90 years of age and still runs the organisation.  Several years ago the company, which has plants in locations throughout the world, lost a particular production line to Australia, whereupon the conclusion was reached that the problem was in regard to its cost base.  Action was taken to address this to the extent that last week the company was able to offer a new incentive package of increments to all staff and an announcement that the particular product line has been reclaimed.  What this shows is that for this specific company, the staff are king and the input and co-operation of the workforce is valued.  It is a very successful model of operation, with all profits ploughed back into the company and no shareholders or high powered board of directors demanding a piece of the pie.  The company has competed for more than 50 years on an international basis in what is a very competitive industry.There is a lesson here to which we all should give our attention.  Were more companies globally and in this State run according to that model, we would have much happier and healthier workplaces.  I have been impressed down the years with the way in which Servier Industries Limited has recruited locally and engaged with institutes of technologies and colleges to ensure a continuing stream of workers, from the indigenous community where possible but not exclusively.  Many of the issues raised in this Bill are set against the background of an adversarial model of employer-worker relations.  It does not have to be that way, but there is no denying that disputes will inevitably arise.  In that context, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and others are working hard to improve the laws relating to the protection of employees.  Some of the provisions in this Bill would have a negative impact in terms of employers contemplating taking on staff, even apart from the implications for industrial relations thereafter.  We must be careful to ensure any proposed measures are considered in a steady and cautious manner.  The rights commissioner hearings have been reduced in any case, and they have achieved the targets set.  The Bill seeks to establish in law aspirations that are not necessarily required.  The Government is working towards a model that will satisfy all concerns in regard to employee protections.  I thank the Sinn  Féin Members for bringing this legislation to the floor of the House for discussion.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I thank the proposers of the Bill for bringing it forward for consideration.  There was some historic reference made to the lock-out of 1913.  That great struggle between capital and labour took place not five years before the then president of Sinn Féin, Arthur Griffith, asked the Labour Party to stand down on the basis that workers' rights in this country would have to wait their day.  We have come a long in Irish history in less than 100 years when Sinn Féin is taking a stand in this House in regard to workers' rights.  On 1 May, above all other days, I commend the party in this regard.The Bill, however, has some technical defects that render much of it undesirable to bring into law.  The proposed amendment to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 could have the effect of allowing an employer to render a company insolvent when efforts could be made to restructure it and protect a portion of the employment where that can be provided for through dialogue.  A further proposed amendment to section 6 of the 1984 Act introduces an ambiguity as to which Minister in particular is to be referred to.  This could prove problematic in that a Minister could unwittingly act in excess of his or her jurisdiction, which might then cause harm to the welfare of an employee.  According to today's press release from Sinn Féin, the Bill is intended to address the recent redundancy situation that arose largely from decisions by foreign courts to order sudden wind-ups of companies operating in this State as part of multinational groups.  As many of these cases related to decisions of courts in fellow European Union member states, an appropriate solution might be sought in the context of EU legislation to address this issue on a pan-European basis.  If I understood Deputy Seán Crowe correctly, he is in favour of such an approach, in which case I will certainly be happy to add my voice in calling on the Government to address that at a European level.The main criticism of the historic industrial relations mechanisms in this country has had to do with the lack of expediency, as highlighted by other speakers.  It is simply unacceptable in this economy that workers must wait up to three years for a recommendation or determination and even longer for a final resolution.The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has made significant progress in this area and stated his main aim is to provide an independent, effective, impartial, as well as a simple, cost effective and workable means to seek redress in respect of an enforcement order within a reasonable period of time.  His initiatives include the single contact portal, the single complaint form and the early resolution service.  Information on all aspects of employment rights and industrial relations is now available on the one website.The Minister and his Department have also commenced work on a Bill on workers' relations which will wind down and amalgamate the plethora of third party procedures.  The proposed streamlining is welcome, but I call on the Minister to include in the Bill further steps and measures that would provide for recommendations of the Labour Court having a more binding effect.  It is my personal view that the Government ought to grant an exemption in the context of the cap on public sector recruitment to deal with speciality and resources issues, as referred to in the Bill.I wish to comment on companies such as Vodafone which has moved its operations to the lower cost economy of Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Deputy on the other side of the House will be delighted for his other constituency in the North regarding the job growth that will occur in that area.  I do not see Deputy Gerry Adams here defending his constituents in Dundalk who are on their knees suffering as a consequence of Vodafone's decision to move operations to Newry.  We must look at this issue because it is a disgrace that companies can continue to receive State contracts at local and national level while remaining very profitable.  The French republic would ensure companies acted in a manner that would protect the interests of the French economy.  It is important companies such as Vodafone sit up and listen to the concerns of the Dáil about the treatment of Irish workers.  They are posting millions of euro in profits while moving to lower cost economies.  We have a role in government to review if we should renew contracts with such organisations which are moving across the Border to Newry to pay significantly lower wages.I admire the sentiment more than anyone else in this room about the motivation behind the Bill.  The cause of workers' rights is an important one for the House, but I will be voting against the Bill as it is technically deficient in a number of areas, an aspect that has been acknowledged by the Opposition.  More importantly, it has misidentified the root of the problem.  There is no doubt that the Government has made significant progress on the issue of workers' rights, but more needs to be done.  The Bill, as an Opposition speaker said, is not perfect, but it raises the profile of the debate.  It is important that we identify with those workers who have been affected, mostly in multinational companies which have been put into liquidation outside the jurisdiction.  If we can improve the lot of these workers, the debate will be important.I look forward to the timely progress of the Minister's proposals to the Oireachtas.  He would do well to listen to the sentiments expressed by every speaker with respect to maintaining high standards in the role of third party procedures.  It is my firm belief that in that reform process many of the issues about the duration and timeframe outlined by the Deputy from Sinn Féin would come to an immediate and sudden end if the capacity of the Labour Court could be reviewed with regard to making firm legal determinations rather than recommendations based on a voluntary understanding between bodies.  That is one of the root causes of the two to three year delays workers face when trying to secure a legal right.I look forward to seeing the progress the Minister is making on this issue and adding to the process over the course of the year.  HIs proposals must be brought before the House as soon as possible in order we can include them in the Statute Book to protect vulnerable workers in the economy.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I welcome the steps taken by the Government to date to improve the lot of workers.  An aspect of the debate that not been acknowledged so far is the productive reform of employment rights and industrial relations bodies and the significant progress made in this regard.  Prior to the introduction of the workplace relations customer service in January, it took up to eight months in some instances for employee complaints to be logged and the employer notified.  This notification now takes place within five days of a complaint being logged by the employee.  This is a long overdue and positive development for workers to ensure a greater sense of fairness and accountability.  I regret that some of these aspects have not been acknowledged.  While it is a worthy subject and we all support the sentiments expressed about workers' rights, we must be constructive and fair.To strengthen further the sense of fairness and justice for workers, the reform undertaken by the Government since taking office has led to major improvements in waiting times for hearings with a rights commissioner.  As alluded to, in 2010 it took an average of 142 days to have a hearing scheduled with the LRC.  Waiting times to schedule a hearing with the rights commissioner are now a matter of weeks.  These positive developments are welcomed by all those who have been forced to avail of their offices.There have been further administrative improvements with regard to the associated paperwork.  A single complaint form has been produced which replaces the previous array of more than 30 complaint forms.  These and other improvements are to be welcomed by all sides of the House.Dealing with the specifics of the Bill, it is important that we deal with requests for an extension of notification or consultation periods sensibly and practically.  We must recognise the current period of notification has served the State and the workforce well in many cases in the past 30 years.  It is not prudent or advisable to change legislation based on the experience of a minority of cases that, by and large, do not represent the norm, without taking collective note of the entire picture at any one time.As legislators, our work must be informed by the people we represent.  These are challenging times for society and the need to protect the vulnerable, including workers, is undisputed.  Any attempt, however, to forcibly swing the pendulum in one direction or another must be made carefully, cognisant of the changing circumstances of all stakeholders.Further proposals made in the Bill such as imposing a 60 day deadline for hearings are being addressed in the Minister's reforms of the statutory workplace relations, structures and processes.  He is determined to put in place a world class workplace relations service.  I have referred to this issue, while outlining the positive developments such as the vast improvements in waiting times for hearings with a rights commissioner.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I congratulate the proposers of the Bill and I am glad to speak to it.  I agree with the remarks made from the opposite side of the House.  I support the Minister of State's remarks on the issue of insolvency.  That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill but it concerns just one section of the Bill.  I strongly agree with Deputy Com Keaveney in his remarks about the powers of the Labour Court.  Last Thursday I had a long debate with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment about that matter because it was the subject of my first priority question to him.  I regret to inform the House that he resolutely refused to have anything to do with changing them in the slightest way.  Clearly, work remains to be done in that regard.The two main proposals made in the Bill would serve to speed up hearings before employment rights bodies.  I heard people talk about a period of weeks, but 52 or 75 weeks could still be defind as a matter of weeks.  The latest figures available to me suggest that if someone wants to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, he or she will be waiting for a year and a half.  That is a disgrace.  If someone wants to go to the Labour Court and happens to live outside Dublin, it will take six months.  If someone wants to go to a rights commissioner, again, he or she must wait at least six months.  Such delays should not happen in these cases; they amount to a gross injustice.  Therefore, I welcome any proposal, from wherever it comes, that might alleviate the situation.I take the Government's point that it is preparing its own proposals in respect of this matter.  The advance publicity in respect of those proposals has prompted me to harbour certain concerns about them.  I am more concerned about the Government's proposals than I am about Sinn Féin's, even though I know the latter are not perfect either.  It would do no harm, in the short term, if the Government were to accept the aspect of the Bill to which I refer.  Anything that can be done to alleviate the type of grossly unjust delays that are occurring would be welcome.  Members on this side of the House are not entitled to put forward proposals which involve a charge on the Exchequer.  I am of the view it will take more than legislation to rectify the position in respect of this matter and that a substantial commitment of resources is going to be required.The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, focused entirely on the forthcoming proposals, which we eagerly await and which are supposed to be in place by the autumn.  I hope they will be in place at that time.  The Minister of State did not advert to the fact that the second principle aim of the Bill before the House, namely, that which relates to collective redundancies, will not be dealt with in the Government's proposals.  The latter are administrative in nature and will deal with the system of making complaints.  The issue of collective redundancies is above and beyond that.I welcome the provisions in the Bill which relate to lengthening the period during which consultations and negotiations may take place in the event of collective redundancies.  The Bill would bring the law in this country into line with that which obtains in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  However, I must sound a note of caution.  Anybody who might seek to have the law here on the same footing as the law in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland should be careful.  The 90 day period provided for in the United Kingdom in respect of undertakings with more than 100 employees is under attack from the Conservative-Liberal coalition.  Various mutterings have been heard from Ministers and unnamed UK Government sources to the effect that this period is too long, that it hinders restructuring, etc. and that, in any event, it is not necessary in the digital age.  I do not agree with such criticisms and I wish those who are making them would declare themselves publicly in order that a proper debate might take place.The UK authorities are also contemplating increasing the period, from one year to two, for which a person must be employed in order to take an unfair dismissal case.  They are also considering imposing a fee on those who bring cases before employment rights bodies.  Even if we wanted to bring the law into line with that which obtains in the UK, I am sure we would not want to go down the road of imposing fees.  When he introduced the legislation relating to joint labour committees, JLCs, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated that for competitive and many other reasons it would be very desirable if the law in this country were on a par with that in the United Kingdom.  Strangely enough, he is now adopting a diametrically opposite position in respect of the Bill before the House.  It has been posited, for example, that for all sorts of reasons the law in Ireland in respect of this matter cannot be in line with the law in the UK.  I recall the Minister bemoaning how quickly the matter relating to TalkTalk in Waterford proceeded to finality.  He has the opportunity to change the position in this regard by accepting the legislation.  There are worse examples of the speed with which these matters are dealt.  I understand Lagan Brick stopped operations within hours of the employees being informed of what was happening.I am of the view we should look beyond the United Kingdom to other jurisdictions to see what we can do to improve employee rights without jeopardising foreign direct investment.  While the matter dealt with in this Bill in the context of collective redundancies is important, it is only one small aspect of the general problem that exists.  There is a much bigger picture of which we must be aware.  The European Commission is conducting a detailed audit in respect of collective redundancies, the transfer of undertakings and information and consultation directives.  When the Minister or whoever replies to this debate on the Government's behalf tomorrow, I would like to be informed with regard to the input Ireland is having into this audit.  The outcome of the Commission's audit will ultimately be reflected in the laws of the State.  However, that is a matter for the future.  We are concerned with the present, especially in the context of the fact that redundancies are not going to cease.The Bill contains provisions which will marginally improve the lot of workers in the event of collective redundancies taking place.  The rights of workers are quite scant and they are certainly not that extensive in nature.  We are concerned with vulnerable individuals who will be facing into redundancy and a loss of livelihood.  Some of them will be being made unemployed after many years in work.  They will also be obliged to deal with a loss of status in society and a catastrophic drop in their living standards.  The Bill, limited though it may be, seeks to give them extra rights and to improve their situation to some extent.  My advice to the Labour Party members of the Government would be to approach the relevant Minister or the Taoiseach and persuade them to allow the Bill to proceed on its course.  This legislation is not going to do any harm and it has the capacity to do some good.  Those in the Labour Party should not come before the House and refer to May Day, James Connolly and so forth and then vote down legislation which is designed to help workers who are at their most vulnerable.  Those to whom I refer should certainly not vote against the Bill on the basis of some vague promise of jam tomorrow or in the dim and distant future.Anything which assists extremely vulnerable workers at a time when they are facing into a personal and financial catastrophe should be both welcomed and taken on board by the Government.  If the latter has more extensive and better proposals to introduce in the future - I do not care whether these originate with the EU or come from within the Department - then it can by all means introduce them.  In the interim, however, it should grant the temporary alleviation envisaged in the Bill before the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I compliment Deputy Tóibín and his colleagues on bringing forward this Bill.  I particularly compliment Deputy Crowe on his contribution, which I watched earlier on the monitor in my office.The area to which the Bill relates is extraordinarily complex and I bear the scars of having served for 22 months as the Minister of State with responsibility for it.  A great deal of progress was achieved during that time.  Many Members referred to the reforms that are under way in the employment rights institutions at present and I compliment the Minister on his appointment of Ger Deering as the lead person in respect of this matter.  Mr. Deering, who is head of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, will bring a great deal of innovation to this area.  At the end of the process which Mr. Deering is co-ordinating and which began with the BearingPoint report, many of the difficulties to which Deputies on both sides of the House referred in respect of waiting times, dispute shopping and access points will be resolved.I am struck by the fact the Dáil is in its summer session and that it was at the end of the corresponding session last year that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, brought forward his original proposals in respect of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, JLC agreements, etc.  At that time, the Labour backbenchers engaged in a May Day revolution.  It is almost one year on but matters have not moved on.  I accept that what is envisaged in the Bill would be quite slow in nature and I would have supported many of the original proposals brought forward by the Minister.  In that context, there is a need to provide protection to the workers who have been affected in the meantime by the closures in Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick, Irish Cement, TalkTalk and La Senza.It is important to state the companies to which I refer are in a minority.  The majority of employers work within the law.  In fact, the laws in this area, when properly implemented, offer extremely strong protections.  At present, the majority of self-employed persons are probably not taking wages from their own businesses in an attempt to keep those businesses afloat and to retain people in employment.  In discussing the role of dishonour that is headed by Vita Cortex, we must remember that the majority of employers are decent people who do their best for those who work with them.  On the day that is in it, the House should send its best wishes to the workers at Vita Cortex and Lagan Brick who are still occupying their employers' premises as they seek to obtain their basic rights.  Deputy Crowe referred to those individuals who, during the past year, have been present in the Visitors Gallery for various debates on workers' rights and other specific issues.  We have not yet put in place the protections to avoid that small number of employers sullying the great cause of the majority of employers.I was particularly struck by the TalkTalk closure.  I know it was a minority case; the Minister referred to the fact that the issue of collective redundancy and one month's notice is rare.  TalkTalk's business model completely depended on its employees and their skills.  I visited TalkTalk several years ago when it received an excellence through people award, such was the quality of its employees' skills.  Management in this UK company, however, turned its back at an hour's notice on those hundreds of employees in Waterford.  The strength and quality of those workers is evident in the fact that some of them have established their own call centre businesses employing many people after they were made redundant.When we have a gap in our employee protection legislation that allows such events as the TalkTalk closure occur while Ministers and officers of the State can only look on in wonder and disgust, Parliament has a duty to act.  I know the difficulties around re-engineering the employment rights bodies and JLCs are significant with many stakeholders to be brought on board which the Minister is trying to do.  We have identified a specific gap in the legislation which has been disgracefully exploited by foreign multinationals.  If this were a gap in criminal law, we would act with emergency legislation very quickly.  As it is employment law, the same urgency is not there even though the consequences for other workers when losing their jobs are as great.The Bill is technically flawed with many difficulties.  However, that is what Committee Stage is about – to debate every aspect of a Bill.  If the Government had the courage to carry it on to Committee Stage and put forward amendments to deal with the technical flaws, then instead of sending good wishes to the Vita Cortex and Lagan Brick workers we could actually do something for them and avoid it happening again.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I welcome this Bill before the House and commend Deputy Tóibín for this urgently needed initiative.  In numerous sudden company closures in the past, employees in many cases were badly treated by employers with no prior notice when they were legally entitled to four weeks' notice and several more infringements of employee protection regulations.  There is an onus on the Government to dramatically rework the current legislation, putting a greater onus on the employer in terms of communication and co-operation with employees regarding company closure and redundancy.  The consultation periods proposed in the Bill are welcome.Problems with existing employee protection legislation have been blatantly demonstrated over the past several years.  Many of these problems are due to the fact that union membership has been decimated in the private sector with only one in four workers now unionised.  I have called on the Government to rescind the decision in the second last budget to abolish the measure whereby union subscriptions were tax deductible.  I am calling again for the Government to make this measure a priority.  The measure's re-introduction would incentivise vulnerable workers to have union membership and, thereby, be properly and professionally represented.  In contrast to this, the public sector has almost 100% union representation.The Government should at least have the general thrust of this Bill referred to an all-party jobs committee to deliberate on it and arrive at improved legislation to protect vulnerable workers in the private sector.  The average waiting period for claims to the employment appeals tribunal is up to 80 weeks.  I brought this to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in a previous debate a year ago and he promised these matters would be expedited.  However, the backlog remains.  The Minister needs to act immediately in dealing with the backlog.  I would suggest he introduce a fast-track system whereby mediation could be involved.

The Labour Party has nothing in common with James Connolly, the great trade unionist, socialist and republican who gave his life for the working classes.  There is no doubt but that James Connolly would turn in his grave if he saw the savage attacks the Government, and the Labour Party in particular, has made against working people such as the dismantling of the social welfare system last week by the Minister for Social Protection – Minister for social destruction might be a better name – the sale of State assets and the targeting of the vulnerable coping classes, namely middle and low-income families.  This is all happening while the super-rich get off scot free.I support this Bill which is a reasonable and genuine attempt to support workers who find themselves in difficulty when laid off without notice.  I commend Sinn Féin on bringing it forward.  There may well be flaws in it but the legislative process is there to iron out these.  Last week's social welfare Bill contained a significant number of amendments which effectively meant it was a new Bill by the time it passed Committee Stage.  It is not unusual for Bills to be amended during their passage through the House.The Bill aims to assist laid-off workers who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and are entitled to a fair shake from the State.  Currently, 29,000 redundancy claims are stuck in a queue while it takes 18 months for a case to get to the employment appeals tribunal and six months to the Labour Court.  These are unacceptable delays.  This Bill makes a reasonable and genuine effort to deal with those.

Since its establishment, Culture Ireland has to date promoted and supported over 6,600 Irish cultural projects and events in over 74 countries, ranging across music, theatre, dance, literature, film, visual art and architecture. In 2011 alone, and excluding over 500 events as part of the Imagine Ireland initiative, Culture Ireland supported another 330 tours, events and projects by Irish artists across five continents.In addition, Culture Ireland continues to aid the promotion of Irish cultural and creative excellence in Europe and in key export markets, such as China. Working in tandem with the promotion of trade, investment, tourism, agri-food and science, it is assisting in providing fresh and innovative opportunities. Our EU Presidency in 2013 now presents an additional platform for cultural links to be enhanced with key European partners. My Department, through Culture Ireland, is leading on the international dimension of the Cultural Programme for the EU Presidency.At Government level, it will be recalled too that the recent visit to Ireland of Vice-President Xi Jinping provided a major boost to the profile of Irish culture and heritage in China, as well as strengthening our overall relationship with the People's Republic and with their most senior leadership. On the occasion of that visit, through Culture Ireland, my Department assisted the Government in organising a special performance of Riverdance, which took place in Dublin in honour of the Vice-President and his delegation, building on the extraordinary success and impact that this show has generated in China over the last decade.

As outlined in those replies, I met the Chair and Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland and had a constructive engagement on the issues.  At the time of my initial suggestion, the future ownership of the Bank was in question. My raising of the College Green issue was exploratory and it came to unintended public attention. Clearly, too, it caught the public imagination.This building was the first purpose-built Parliament in Europe. Completed in 1739, it served as Ireland's Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801. By extension, the question of its future use was entirely appropriate, given its resonances throughout public, cultural and civic life in this country.  However, the ownership of Bank of Ireland is no longer a matter for debate. The building, which is its landmark building, remains in the ownership of the Bank and is the biggest of its branches. I am continuing my dialogue with the Bank on this matter and, in particular, around the Building's continued availability for arts and cultural events and purposes.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	334	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced its Public Service Reform Plan on 27 November 2011.  Appendix IIA to that Plan sets out a number of bodies to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012. Actions in respect of my own Departmental remit include the following:Combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining separate identities.Merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library, while maintaining separate identities.Clearly, the amalgamation and merger of these bodies raises complex issues, which my Department is currently examining. In that context, the views of the various interested parties are being noted and considered. The artistic and curatorial autonomy of each of the institutions is, of course, a major consideration in this regard.  My Departmental has established a high-level Reform Committee and is liaising with the various bodies with a view to implementing the Government's Decision in these matters as effectively and efficiently as possible.  I expect to be reverting to Government on progress made in relation to this process by end-June of this year.

The Minister has stated that he expects The Gathering   to be one of the biggest tourism initiatives ever staged in Ireland. It will be a year-long event in 2013, where people at home and abroad can play a part in the country’s recovery, potentially bringing in 325,000 extra tourists and providing a major economic stimulus.I believe that The Gathering is a hugely important and timely initiative for the tourism sector and one that my Department, together with the cultural and heritage bodies which operate under its aegis, including the National Cultural Institutions, will be pleased to support and participate in. While no specific funding has been identified for marketing in relation to The Gathering, the Directors of the Cultural Institutions are aware of the potential increase in visitor numbers that could be achieved during the event. As such, they will ensure that 2013 marketing plans for their Institutions will be carried out with The Gathering   in mind and with a view to attracting more of these visitors.I would also see the proposed Gathering   as an excellent opportunity to enhance genealogical tourism. In that context, officials from my Department are working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and in agencies within its ambit — Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Genealogical records made available through my Department and bodies under its aegis have been extremely popular with the public, at home and abroad. The success of the digitisation project of the 1901-1911 Censuses is the best proof of this. This website, hosted and managed by the National Archives of Ireland, has proved to be phenomenally popular, with over 698 million hits and over 14 million individual visits to date.  The Certificate of Irish Heritage has now been linked to that site.

Details of these can be accessed on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at www.per.gov.ie. Clearly, the amalgamation and merger of these bodies, including the consolidation of boards, raises complex issues, which my Department is currently examining.

The management of these exhibitions and exhibition material is an operational matter for which the individual institutions have responsibility and this is reflected, in particular, in the legislative basis under which the national cultural institutions operate.  These institutions include the National Museum, the National Gallery, the National Library IMMA, the Chester Beatty Library, and the Crawford Art Gallery. Arrangements are made from time to time for the loan of artefacts and works in the national collections to regional museums and galleries, provided conditions as to security, accreditation and so forth are met.The Arts Council also has a collection consisting of some 1,000 works of contemporary Irish art.  The collection represents emerging, as well as more established, artists.  Over 80% of the collection is on loan to public institutions around the country.  The Council operates a Loan Scheme enabling organisations such as schools, hospitals, local authorities, public galleries and other public institutions to borrow works of art from its collection for periods of up to two years, so as to ensure that the maximum number of people have access to this extensive collection of contemporary Irish art. Details of how to apply are available on the Council's website (http://virtualgallery.artscouncil.ie/loan.html), as is a virtual tour of the collection.My Department is committed to providing annual funding to certain other cultural institutions which hold collections of moveable cultural heritage of national importance, or collections that are unique in the country and relate to matters of national interest, or that relate to international culture. These institutions and their collections are accessible to the public.  Such institutions include the Hunt Museum, Archbishop Marsh's Library and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum.The Deputy may be aware that the AIB recently has entered into a partnership with the State in respect of its art collection.  Crawford Art Gallery is to house this gift of 39 key pieces from the AIB as an addition to the permanent collection on view there.  The AIB will also be making available a further 991 works for exhibition by publicly funded galleries through the aegis of the Crawford Art Gallery.  The collection was exhibited in the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork for several weeks and has now moved to Limerick.  It is proposed that a number of works of art from this collection will continue to be exhibited in a number of publicly funded galleries through the aegis of the Crawford Art Gallery. In addition, the Great Southern art collection was secured by the State some years ago and is also held in the Crawford Gallery. Works from this collection have been exhibited in many other galleries and indeed in my own Department's office in Killarney.Finally, some of the most ambitious capital projects funded under my Department's ACCESS scheme are art galleries, such as the Carlow Contemporary Art Gallery, the Niland in Sligo and the Limerick City Art Gallery. These galleries draw regularly on the national collection for exhibitions.

The importance and impact of arts and culture is an essential element to our identity, profile, confidence and place in the world.  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts and cultural sectors make to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.Within the current economic constraints, our investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever due to the employment intensity of the sector.  The arts are a significant economic contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.  The arts underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, in the creation of an imaginative labour force, in establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive and in cultural tourism.A report entitled  An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland,   published by the Arts Council in 2011, updates a previous independent evaluation by consultants Indecon of the economic impact of the arts, published in 2009.  The updated report shows that the arts provide significant direct and indirect employment. The sector supports 21,328 jobs and contributes €306.8 million in taxes.  The arts also impact on the wider creative industries, contributing €4.7 billion to the economy and supporting 79,000 jobs.In relation to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, there are 11 specific actions to be undertaken by my Department and the agencies under its remit in the areas of arts, culture and creative enterprise. Together, I believe that we can work to realise the explicit and implicit targets set for these areas. The relevant actions (under section 7 of the Plan) are set out below:7.14.1: Take actions as set out in the Creative Capital Report prepared by the Audiovisual Strategic Review Steering Group to double the value of the film and audiovisual sector by 2016 to over €1 billion, double employment to over 10,000 and increase cultural exports of Irish audiovisual productionSteps Necessary for DeliveryTimeline Responsible bodyWork with the audiovisual industry to grow exportsOngoing 2012 Irish Film BoardUndertaking a range of skills initiatives to address medium to long-term challenges for the sectorOngoing 2012 Irish Film BoardLeveraging investment in data centers and cloud computing to create distribution and fulfillment opportunities for the digital content industries.Ongoing 2012 Irish Film Board7.14.2Through Culture Ireland, maximise the business opportunities abroad for cultural and artistic businesses and enterprises by promoting Irish artists world-wide and showcasing our strengths in culture and creativity.Ongoing 2012 DAHG/IDA7.14.3Through Culture Ireland, undertake joint marketing activities with the enterprise development agencies to build ‘brand Ireland’ in this sector.Ongoing 2012 DAHG/Enterprise agencies7.14.4Leverage the potential for language and roots tourism, working with Tourism Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland, Foras na Gaeilge and relevant partners.Ongoing 2012 DAHG/ Tourism Ireland, National Archives of Ireland / Foras na Gaeilge and relevant partners7.14.5Roll-out further cultural digitization initiatives, in partnership with the private sector, in order the leverage our unique cultural offerings and bring them to a wider internationalaudience.Ongoing 2012 DAHG7.14.6Through the Arts Council, support over 50 venues, approximately 200 festivals and 400arts organisations in 2012, supporting employment in communities across the country, both directly through funding artists and organisations and indirectly in the tourism sector and the wider economy.Ongoing 2012 DAHG7.14.7Ensure continuity in the provision of heritage services nationally through an allocation of €48m for 2012.Ongoing 2012 DAHG7.14.8Invest in quality customer offerings through the National Cultural Institutions and regional cultural bodies and enterprises to enhance our overall tourism offering and to make Ireland a destination of cultural distinction for the cultural tourists globally.Ongoing 2012 DAHG7.18.9Support research activities of relevance to the sector including research in the areas of digital networks, communications and radio spectrum optimization, semantic web and sensor web, big data and data analytics, and their application in sectors such as film and television, social media and publishingOngoing 2012 Research funders and Prioritisation Action Group
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	339	My Department has responsibility for the development of a commemorative programme for the Decade of Centenaries 2012 to 2022, which will present the economic, social and cultural history of the period, although official consideration at this time is currently being focused on the period 2012 to 2016.  The All-Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on Commemorations, of which I am chair, has now met on a number of occasions. This Group recently received a delegation from the Unionist Centenary Council and, at its meeting of May 22nd, it is planned to receive a delegation from Dublin City Council. The Group has also received submissions from a number of other local authorities and groups, and full engagement with these and other interested parties is planned.An Expert Advisory Group of eminent historians has also been established, which will advise Government and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on both the overall commemorative programme and on any specific issues which may arise. This Group, chaired by Dr Maurice Manning and supported by Dr Martin Mansergh, will have its second meeting tomorrow (May 2nd).  It is expected to consult widely with scholars, with universities, with educational and cultural bodies, with local historical associations and committees, and with individuals, where appropriate. It will seek to encourage original research at local and national level, at all times acknowledging the identities and traditions which are part of the historic story of the island of Ireland and Irish people worldwide.In addition, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Sovereign Matters, under the Chairmanship of Mr Frank Feighan, TD, is undertaking a study on how best to approach the series of commemorations. I understand that this Committee last met on April 23rd and that a delegation from the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund gave presentations in terms of their plans.To date in 2012, there have been a number of significant centenary commemoration events. In early March, I participated, with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister Carál Ní Chuilín, in the launch of the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council and Heritage Lottery Fund lecture series entitled "Remembering the Future”. In late March, First Minister Peter Robinson visited the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at Iveagh House in Dublin to offer to an invited audience his reflections on Carson’s influence and on Irish Unionism.  The centenary of the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill on April 11th was marked by a commemorative event in Waterford. At this event, the legacy of John Redmond, the Parnellites and the Home Rule Movement was highlighted by expert speakers.Last week, I was privileged to address a conference of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in Belfast about the Ulster Covenant, the centenary of which will be marked on September 28th of this year. In addition, the county libraries of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan will host exhibitions on the Ulster Covenant, with support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Other events planned this year within the ambit of my own Department include the exhibition "Home Rule: Ireland at the Cross Roads 1900-1914”, which will open on May 25th at the Hugh Lane Gallery, the completion of the restoration of Erskine Childers’ yacht, Asgard, and the continuation of the National Library of Ireland’s Europeana World War I   collection roadshows. At these roadshows, families from all of Ireland will be afforded the opportunity to contribute artefacts and stories from their family experience of World War I to a pan-European exhibition.I am very grateful for the support of the Oireachtas Consultation Group and the Expert Advisory Group. I also very much appreciate the contributions and assistance of officeholders from Britain and Northern Ireland to recent commemorative events. I hope to continue and develop these exchanges, particularly with the assemblies of Wales and Scotland, over the course of the Decade of Commemorations.  I would like to emphasise my personal welcome for all suggestions and contributions to the development of the commemorative programme. If the Deputies have any particular interests or concerns in this regard, I would be glad to hear from them.

Mar aitheantas ar an dúshlán sin, tá an-bhéim leagtha ag mo Roinnse ar a thábhachtaí is atá sé go gcuirfí na hacmhainní cuí ar fáil do chomhlachtaí poiblí le gur féidir leo a gcuid seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a fheabhsú.Ar na tionscnaimh a forbraíodh i gcomhar le gníomhaireachtaí eile le blianta beaga anuas, tá:córas um Dhearbhú Cáilíochta d'Aistritheoirí agus d'Eagarthóirí;bunachair shonraí de théarmaí agus de logainmneacha ar líne —www.focal.ie agus www.logainm.ie;acmhainní cuimhne aistriúcháin Gaeilge;gluais de chomharthaí agus de théarmaí eile ar líne —www.gaeilge.ie;bunachar sonraí de théarmaí an Aontais Eorpaigh agus de théarmaí dlíthiúla i nGaeilge; aguslíne chabhrach do cheisteanna ar gach gné den Ghaeilge —www.freagra.net.Tá an cheist maidir le cumas comhlachtaí poiblí seirbhísí a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge agus ceist na hearcaíochta don Státchóras fite fuaite lena chéile. Ar ndóigh, is ar an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe atá an fhreagracht maidir le polasaí earcaíochta don Státchóras.Ní miste aird a tharraingt ar an méid atá ráite sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge   ina leith seo, is é sin go ndéanfar socruithe cuí chun cur leis an líon oifigeach sa Státchóras atá in ann feidhmiú go dátheangach agus go mbunófar na socruithe sin de réir a chéile, ag aithint na srianta earcaíochta atá ann faoi láthair.

The day-to-day management of these national monuments lies with the Office of Public Works (OPW).  There is significant public access to these properties and, in many cases, guided tours are available.  Information about these properties and about access to them is available on the OPW's website at www.heritageireland.ie.My Department, through its National Parks and Wildlife Service, manages 6 State-owned national parks, as well as 78 nature reserves, 66 of which are in State ownership. National parks and nature reserves are generally open year round.    Information on public access to the national parks and nature reserves and their scientific significance can be found on my Department's National Parks and Wildlife's website at www.npws.ie.  To encourage and maximise use of these wonderful facilities, access is free of charge in all cases.There is evidence to suggest that Ireland's historic and natural environment is an increasingly important element of our national tourism product. Investment in the conservation of our built and natural heritage has the dual benefits of preserving these properties for the enjoyment of present and future generations, while also improving the local and national economy through the generation and expansion of responsible sustainable tourism.  It is, therefore, my intention to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, public access and appropriate visitor use of national parks and nature reserves.  Such access and use must be consistent with the ethos of the parks as natural places of peace and tranquillity set in scenic landscapes, as well as being compatible with the conservation and biodiversity considerations that are of necessity associated with the management of heritage properties.  For example, the national parks and nature reserves are largely covered by designations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and all activities within these sites must be consistent with the requirements of the Directives.Within the constraints imposed by current economic conditions, I will invest in visitor facilities in parks and nature reserves to maximise their sustainable use and enjoyment.  To this end, and building on previous investment in this area, my Department is working on proposals to further develop visitor facilities such as walking routes, enhanced signage and interpretation.As regards visitor centres, in the last few years my Department has opened modern top quality centres at Ballycroy National Park, Co. Mayo, and Clara Bog Nature Reserve in Co. Offaly.  Also, I will shortly open the new Burren National Park Visitor Information Point in Corofin, Co. Clare, while work is progressing on the redevelopment of Killarney House in Killarney National Park.

Tá sé ráite i gClár an Rialtais 2011-2016   go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas tacaíocht don Straitéis agus go ndéanfaidh sé na spriocanna indéanta atá luaite inti a chur i gcrích.  Aithnítear sa Straitéis féin go bhfuil gá le cur chuige céimneach chun bearta éagsúla na Straitéise a chur i gcrích. Le linn 2011, thug oifigigh mo Roinne faoi chéim an bhunaithe den Straitéis inar díríodh ar bhunú na struchtúr eagraíochtúil agus oibríochtúil, mar atá ráite i bplean forfheidhmithe mo Roinne don Straitéis don bhliain 2011.Bunaíodh struchtúir ar leith chun an Straitéis a sheachadadh agus eagraítear cruinnithe, de réir mar is gá, faoi na struchtúir seo:Tá an Coiste Rialtais ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht, a bhfuil an Taoiseach ina chathaoirleach air, ag déanamh maoirseachta ar an dul chun cinn leis an Straitéis.Tá Grúpa Oifigeach Sinsearach, atá comhdhéanta d'oifigigh ardleibhéil ó Ranna cuí, ag tacú leis an gCoiste Rialtais.Tá Grúpa Idir-Rannach, a bhfuil mise, mar Aire Stáit, mar chathaoirleach air, ag déanamh comhordú ar chur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise.Tá Aonad Straitéise i mo Roinn freagrach as pleanáil agus feidhmiú na Straitéise a threorú.Maidir leis an nGrúpa Idir-Rannach, bhí an chéad chruinniú den ghrúpa ann ar an 8 Feabhra 2012 chun cur i bhfeidhm réimsí sonracha gnímh sa Straitéis a bhrú chun cinn ar bhealach comhtháite. Bhí ionadaithe sinsearacha ó na Ranna ábhartha i láthair agus beidh an chéad chruinniú eile den ghrúpa ann ar an 27 Meitheamh 2012.Mar atá luaite sna Ceisteanna, tá 9 réimse gnímh leagtha amach sa Straitéis. Tá trí ghrúpa oibre ardleibhéil bunaithe ag mo Roinnse leis na príomhpháirtithe leasmhara chun dlús a chur le feidhmiú réimsí gnímh éagsúla den Straitéis. Eagraítear cruinnithe de na grúpaí oibre seo, de réir mar is gá:Grúpa oibre idir mo Roinnse agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna chun tosaíochtaí a aithint maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise i réimse gnímh an oideachais, ag tabhairt san áireamh na laincisí ar acmhainní i láthair na huaire.Grúpa oibre idir mo Roinnse, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Foras na Gaeilge chun idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir na feidhmeanna ar leith a bheidh á gcomhlíonadh ag na comhlachtaí poiblí seo faoin Straitéis ar bhealach a chinnteoidh go mbeidh an luach is fearr ar airgead ag an Státchiste agus nach mbeidh aon dúbláil soláthair ann.Grúpa oibre idir mo Roinnse, an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus an Roinn Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta maidir le hinfheistíocht fiontraíochta sa Ghaeltacht.Mar thoradh ar chinntí polasaí a thóg an Rialtas ar an 31 Bealtaine 2011 maidir leis na struchtúir fhorfheidhmithe don Straitéis agus maidir leis an sainmhíniú nua don Ghaeltacht, tá oifigigh mo Roinne ag tabhairt tús áite do dhréachtú an Bhille Gaeltachta 2012, a thabharfaidh feidhm, de réir mar is cuí, do na cinntí Rialtais.Ar an 26 Aibreán 2012, d'fhógair mé dhá thionscnamh shuntasacha faoin Straitéis. Ar an gcéad dul síos, chuir mé tús leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht faoina mbeidh plean teanga á ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail do gach ceantar Gaeltachta i gcomhréir leis an Straitéis.

I have no function in relation to the adjoining development site.  As part of the consent application process, the applicant was required to provide an assessment of the wider battlefield context of the national monument site. This has been received and is being examined.  Also as part of the consent process, I have visited the monument site and met various representative groups, including the group referred to. A decision will be made on the consent application as soon as possible.  I would like to point out that I have no function in relation to the National Asset Management Agency.

However, under the National Archives Act, the National Archives can give advice on matters relating to archives. Therefore, staff in the National Archives is available to offer advice to the project in question, if such advice would be helpful.I understand that the project is an important resource available to the public in its own right.  I am very conscious of the importance of digitising material in order to protect our cultural heritage for future generations.  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Archives have embarked on an extensive digitalisation programme of State records, most significantly in recent years the digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census returns, which has generated huge interest, resulting in millions of visits to the National Archives website.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Following on from discussions between my Department and relevant stakeholders, including Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Temple Bar Cultural Trust and St. Patrick's Festival, it was agreed that the commitment in the Programme for Government to expand the Culture Night concept and to consider making it a twice yearly event would be best met by the designation/delivery of an International Week of Irish Culture,   based around the St. Patrick’s Day Festival.  This would allow for the cultivation and development of the solid foundations already in place to showcase to the world Ireland’s rich and varied cultural heritage and to promote Ireland as a destination for cultural tourists.The initiative essentially envisages a 5-year development plan, commencing in 2012 and ultimately potentially linking with 2016 commemorations.  This year, the emphasis was on:the international launch of the "International Celebration of Irish Culture” brand abroad;a series of programme activities based in existing cultural venues around the Merrion Square/Kildare Street areas of Dublin;marketing the message of "I Love my City”; andusing the existing St. Patrick's Festival activity to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally.The initiative was well received and supported in both national and international spheres.In addition, in further recognition of the commitment in the Programme for Government, Culture Night 2012 will be fostered and developed as a unique offering of memorable experiences, involving local arts, culture, heritage and communities, which will hopefully stimulate repeat visits to cultural attractions.  Plans for the event are well underway and letters of offer of funding recently issued from my Department to locations that applied to participate in the 2012 regional event.  The aim is to build on the success and popularity of Culture Night to date, which has seen the event grow from a relatively small scale cultural event staged in Dublin only in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, with over 200,000 people in 30 locations across the island of Ireland participating in Culture Night 2011.This year, for the first time, a smartphone/iPhone application will be developed for Culture Night in Dublin, which will allow participants to develop their own personal cultural trails around the city.  It is hoped that this application will act as a platform for the possible development of other Culture Night applications in the participating regions in 2013 and beyond.  I should mention that my Department is also supporting Music Day, to be held this year on 21st June.

The area between Chapelizod and Lucan is protected by a Special Area Amenity Order and part of the Valley has also been identified as a proposed Natural Heritage Area.I further understand that some years ago the Office of Public Works, in association with Dublin City Council and Fingal, Kildare and South Dublin County Councils, commissioned consultants to draw up a strategy for the Liffey Valley, resulting in the strategy document Towards a Liffey Valley Park,   which was published in November 2006. The document set out a strategy to provide an integrated management framework for the Liffey Valley, and to create a process towards the establishment of a Liffey Valley Park which would be composed of a necklace of publicly owned spaces within this area.  Accordingly, it would appear that the implementation of the steps to bring a park into existence in this area is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned.  The report did not recommend the designation of the Liffey Valley as a National Park.

The Media Programme is the EU support programme for the European audiovisual industry.  In Ireland, information on this Programme is available from Media Desk www.mediadeskireland.ie, which provides details on the operation of the Programme, successful projects and funding available at any given time.2. The Culture Programme is the EU support programme for organisations working in the field of culture.  In Ireland, information on this Programme is available from the Cultural Contact Point at www.ccp.ie, which provides comprehensive information on the operation of the Programme.Periodically, there are calls from the European Commission seeking applications for financial support under the Programmes.  The applications are then assessed by an independent body based in Brussels, the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (EACEA). The decisions on what support is provided are based on the merits of the applications.  There is no quota for each country or no amount allocated to each country.Information is available on these two Programmes at the websites I have referred to.  Assistance with applications is also given, as is assistance with identifying funding partners, where relevant.  Any Irish organisation wishing to apply for funding from either programme should make initial contact with the relevant office. The two Programmes will continue until the end of 2013.

The Report was published in July 2011 and an Implementation Committee is at present examining the advancement of its recommendations.  Specifically in relation to industrial relations, I understand that negotiations are ongoing between the relevant parties under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this juncture.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is characterised by non-participation in military alliances. This policy has been underpinned by a set of complementary values which includes the protection of human rights; support for development; and the promotion of disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.    Successive Governments have not interpreted neutrality as meaning that Ireland should avoid international engagement. Rather, they have considered that it enhances our capacity to make a direct and significant contribution to the promotion of global peace and stability through the United Nations, the European Union and in bilateral action.As a member of the United Nations, and in accordance with the UN Charter, we also acknowledge that primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rests with the UN Security Council, and we agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Council acts on behalf of all members. We take seriously the obligation we have assumed to give the Organisation every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter.  Since 2001, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been deployed under the authority of the UN Security Council, which authorised the establishment of a force in the maintenance of security to enable the Afghan authorities as well as UN personnel to operate in a secure environment.  ISAF has a peace enforcement mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.There are thirteen UN Security Council Resolutions relating to ISAF.   The most recent of these, UNSCR 2011, which was adopted on 12 October 2011, extended ISAF's mandate for a further year, and called upon UN Member States to contribute personnel, equipment and resources to the operation.   It also welcomed the long-term commitments made   by Afghanistan's international partners, including NATO, the European Union (EU), neighbouring states and regional partners, to continue supporting Afghanistan beyond the "transition" period.  Ireland supports continuing efforts to develop Afghanistan into a peaceful, democratic nation, based on respect for fundamental human rights, including the rights of Afghan women, and respect for the rule of law.Seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces are serving with ISAF at its Kabul headquarters in non-combatant roles. Their deployment accords fully with both Irish and international law and in no way calls into question Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. The service of the Defence Forces with ISAF represents a further example of Ireland's commitment to participation in UN-mandated peace operations, a long-standing and key foreign policy principle for Ireland.  I would also point out that other neutral and non-aligned States, including Austria, Finland and Sweden, also contribute troops to ISAF.

The family were concerned that there had been no contact from the individual and requested assistance in locating him.  My Department has been providing consular assistance to the family since that time.   In the weeks after the initial disappearance, the Embassy arranged a meeting, which was also attended by an Embassy official, between the family and the Dutch Police.  At that meeting the Dutch Police gave assurances to the family that everything possible was being done to locate their missing relative.  The Police Officer also provided his direct contact details to the family to that they could contact him if any new information was received by them.The Embassy has actively monitored this case continuously and, in March this year, it was told that the Public Prosecutor had decided that the investigation into the disappearance would be re-examined.  Following approaches by the Embassy to the Dutch police and Foreign Ministry last week, appointments have now been arranged between officials of our Embassy and the new Investigating Officer, and also with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to discuss the present status of the investigation and proposed future action into the disappearance of Mr. Grealis.  The family will be informed of the outcome of these meetings.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	356	As the Deputy will be aware my Department provides up to date travel advice for citizens travelling abroad on its website www.dfa.ie. The Department’s Consular Section continuously liaises with its Embassies and other consular partners to ensure this information is accurate and updated when necessary.  My Department strongly advises citizens to take out travel insurance and to register on line with the Department of Foreign Affairs website www.dfa.ie  so that in the event of an emergency or natural disaster the nearest Irish embassy or consulate can contact them if necessary.The travel advice for Azerbaijan was updated on 19 April 2012. The revised advice includes information on the security status and precautions to take.

Ireland's network of diplomatic missions plays a key role in keeping the Government updated on the developments in their countries of accreditation. Officials from our Embassy in Paris, in the usual course of political and economic networking, have of course met with representatives of various candidates in the French Presidential election.  In this context, a wide range of issues have been discussed, including current economic and financial issues.  I am fully abreast of these.The Government has long argued its strong view that recovery in Europe will only be achieved by the adoption of a balanced approach. The Stability Treaty will make a contribution to the restoration of stability and confidence in the euro, but Europe also needs to prioritise and to take actions to generate growth and to promote job creation.  This remains a top-level priority for this Government.  The Government has made it very clear that it will consider with great interest any new proposals to this end — from whatever quarter — and, where they make sense, will lend them support.

E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate.

The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.'.  Separately, a Treaty to establish the European Stability Mechanism has been agreed among euro area countries. This is an intergovernmental treaty that stands outside the EU Treaty framework.  Both instruments are separate and contain their own requirements for entry into force.The amendment to Article 136 will enter into force when approved by all Member States of the EU, including Ireland, according to their national requirements. The target date for this to be done is 1 January 2013.  The ESM Treaty, will enter into force when ratified by signatories whose subscriptions represent 90% of the total initial subscriptions. The target date for this is 1 July 2012.  The Government considers that it is strongly in Ireland's best interests for both instruments to enter into force as soon as possible.  Not approving the amendment of Article 136 will not prevent the ESM Treaty from entering into force once the necessary conditions are met.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	366	In response to the Deputy's question theMoriarty Tribunal made a number of observations and recommendations in relation to Financial Regulation. The report suggests that failures in regulation in the period concerned were related more to the attitude of the Regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers or the overall system then in place. This accords with the extensive analysis of Professor Honohan which concluded that there needed to be a greater degree of intrusiveness and assertiveness on the part of regulators.  Recent reforms of the Central Bank have taken this point through new appointments at top level in the Bank; increased staffing and skills and a programme of legislative reform.
Findings of the Report
The Moriarty Report made the following observations and recommendations in respect of financial regulation:1. The conduct of Guinness and Mahon Bank which gave rise to elements of the report (i.e. the operation of a tax avoidance scheme) failed to be regulated by the Central Bank under the last system but one (whereby there was a single Central Bank with regulatory functions). Since then the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) was established in 2003 and abolished in 2010.2. Failures in regulation were related more to the attitude of the regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers.3. The future vigilance of the regulator can best be ensured by the heightened vigilance of public representatives.These findings are consistent with those of others, such as Professor Honohan in his report on financial regulation and the Comptroller and Auditor General.
Reforms of the Central Bank:
Significant changes have recently been made to the structure governing financial regulation and oversight of the Central Bank. These matters were included in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which was a constituent part of the CBFSAI, was dissolved, the posts of Chief Executive of the Regulatory Authority and Consumer Director were abolished. Two new posts — Head of Financial Regulation and Head of Central Banking — were created.The Bank is now a single fully-integrated structure with a unitary Board, the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the stability of the financial system overall, for prudential regulation of financial institutions and for the protection of consumer interests. The Governor remains solely responsible for European System of Central Banks (ESCB) related functions.The Bank's statutory function of promoting the development within the State of the financial services industry was removed.Annual Performance Statements on regulatory performance prepared by the Bank, presented to the Minister for Finance and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  (Note: this will be in addition to the Bank's Strategy Statement which is to be prepared at least every three years and its Annual Report and Accounts).  A committee of the Oireachtas may call the Governor and/or the Heads of Functions to be examined on the Performance Statement.Regular international peer reviews of regulatory performance with the report of same forming part of the Performance Statement for the relevant year.In addition, the appointment of Professor Honohan as Governor and Mr. Elderfield as Head of Financial Regulation marked a significant change in attitude and approach. Mr. Elderfield is undertaking a very significant programme to enhance the Bank's regulatory capacity which has included the appointment of new staff at all levels within the organisation.
Enhancing the Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central Bank:
The Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central bank are due be strengthened via the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. The Bill responds to the regulatory failures of the financial crisis. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. It also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and will underpin the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.The Bill was published in July 2011 (Government Decision S180/20/10/1435 of 26 July 2011 refers) in accordance with the structural benchmark under the EU-IMF Programme.  The Bill completed Second Stage in October 2011 and is anticipated that it will go to Committee Stage shortly.
Parliamentary Oversight:
The report suggested that the necessary change of attitude by regulators to bring about increased vigilance "can probably best be encouraged by increased vigilance on the part of elected representatives." The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 enhances accountability and oversight mechanisms relating to the governance of the Bank and its regulatory performance.  A Committee of the Oireachtas will receive an annual Regulatory Performance Statement — a new mechanism to increase accountability in respect of regulatory obligations.  This is in addition to more general provisions already in the Central Bank Act 1942 relating to the appearances of the Governor and certain office holders before Oireachtas Committees.  It is also consistent with the recommendations of the C&AG in his special report on the Financial Regulator.
Revenue Matters:

Proposal 1:  Proceedings involving civil and criminal aspects
The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they have put administrative arrangements in place which are designed to enable the civil and criminal aspects of appropriate cases to be managed separately when required.
Proposal 2: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners
Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.
Proposal 3: Representations to Revenue by Office holders
In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.A further recommendation related to the transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The Excessive Deficit Procedure Notification Tables (Maastricht Returns) were published by the Department of Finance and Eurostat on 23rd April 2012. Eurostat has attached two reservations to Ireland's return.  The first reservation refers to the statistical treatment of the July 2011 banking recapitalisation when a net amount of €16.5 billion was injected into Irish financial institutions. At the time of the end-September Maastricht return, it was indicated publicly that a full examination of the deficit-impacting amount of this transfer would be made before the next notification.  The outcome of this exercise is that of the €16.5 billion injected in June 2011, €5.8 billion is classified as a deficit-increasing capital transfer.This adds 3.7 per cent of GDP to the deficit for 2011 only. However, the recapitalisation of July 2011 was fully reflected in Ireland's General Government Debt reported to Eurostat in September 2011, so Ireland is no worse off. This is simply a statistical reclassification from financial transaction to capital transfer for deficit purposes. There is no impact on our debt position.  The reason Eurostat expressed this reservation on the capital transfer amount is due to the fact that restructuring plans of AIB and IL&P, which were used in the analysis, are not yet finalised. This is a prudent approach by Eurostat. When these plans are finalised and if the final versions do not differ significantly from the ones used here, this reservation will be lifted.The second reservation concerns the statistical treatment of the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). A Eurostat 2009 special note on the financial crisis allows for the exclusion from general government debt and deficit statistics of a short-term new special purpose vehicle that is privately owned, is not expected to make losses and whose purpose is to deal with the financial crisis.  The NAMA SPV was established with Eurostat's approval in this way with Irish Life as one of the private owners. However, as Irish Life is now in public ownership, Eurostat has attached a reservation to our Maastricht Returns.However, this is not a concern as my Department has been notified that the sale of the Irish Life shareholding in the NAMA SPV to private investors has been agreed and it is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in the coming weeks. As a consequence, the statistical treatment of the NAMA SPV will be unchanged and it will continue to have no General Government impact.

The settlement of the instalment with a Government bond means that the State did not have to make a cash payment in respect of the 2012 Promissory Note payment to IBRC.In relation to the scheduled liabilities of the bank, the Deputy will also be aware that the Board of the bank is responsible for the day to day operations of the bank. I have been informed by IBRC that the bank and banks in general runs their cash inflows and outflows on a collective (fungible) basis. The bank has also indicated that it does not manage, identify or allocate specific maturing asset inflows against specific contractual maturities.The bank is funded largely by emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Central Bank of Ireland. As these borrowing are short term rolling facilities, which are subject to the ongoing non-objection of a majority the ECB governing council, there are no scheduled ELA liabilities. However, notwithstanding this, both the Government and the ECB are keen to both get IBRC off large scale emergency borrowings from the Central Bank of Ireland and to find a way to re-engineer the promissory notes.  The bank's scheduled liabilities relate to other public debt. These schedule liabilities, as noted above, are managed on a collective basis alongside the other cash inflows and outflows of the bank.

As discussed in the 2012 Stability Programme Update, there are a number of factors holding back consumer spending, including declining real disposables incomes and an elevated savings rate (reflecting inter alia balance-sheet repair, uncertainty and high unemployment).  Since coming into office, the Government has brought forward a number of measures to support the domestic economy and job creation, including the Jobs Initiative, lending targets for the pillar banks and the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. I am confident that these policy actions will help underpin a stabilisation in consumer spending in the near term, followed by a gradual pick-up in private consumption in the years to come.On the VAT increase introduced as part of Budget 2012, I would remind the Deputy of the need to restore order to the public finances. The Government is committed to doing so, and in a way which is least damaging to economic activity. Evidence suggests that direct taxes, such as income tax, are more harmful to economic growth than indirect taxes, such as VAT. This rationale informed our decision at Budget time to keep income tax rates, bands and credits unchanged, but to increase the standard rate of VAT. In the first quarter of 2012, VAT was up by 5.8% year-on-year and 3.2% ahead of profile. Although it is still early in the year, VAT receipts in the first quarter suggest that the annual Budget target of €9,995 million, or a 2.6% increase on 2011 receipts, is achievable.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I have asked the Board of the bank to consider the remuneration packages at the bank.  The Board has consideredreductions in pay levels for individual staff in IBRC but has however, recommended to me its view that pay cuts should not be implemented at this time. The decision not to pursue pay cuts is on the basis that staff retention is a critical issue for IBRC. There has been considerable reduction in staff numbers and current staff are being regularly headhunted by Banks and other organisations. It is the Board's view that further pay cuts would create a risk for the bank in relation to the retention of staff and would impact negatively on the bank's ability to deliver its mandate.The Board has indicated its view that the skills of staff  within IBRC are integral to the successful delivery of the bank's asset recovery programme on behalf of the State and, by extension, the taxpayer.  In this context, IBRC have also pointed out to me that a 20% reduction was applied to the salaries of senior management in the former Anglo Irish Bank immediately post nationalisation. These adjusted lower salaries have remained in place in the organisation for subsequent replacements to those roles.  It should also be noted that IBRC does not operate a performance based incentive plan.  The bank had further indicated that total remuneration paid to the top 50 individuals in the organisation in 2009 has reduced by 15% as at March 2012. In addition, total staff costs in the organisation have reduced by 48% from end 2008 to end 2011 and this includes 6 months of additional cost resulting from the merger with INBS in 2011.Since nationalisation there has been a 60% reduction in total headcount in the combined Anglo Irish Bank and INBS organisations from close to 2,250 in January 2009 to 919 today. IBRC also employs 184 front line staff in its NAMA servicing unit. As part of this reduction, there has been an extensive re-structuring and streamlining of the management structures in IBRC. Of the 50 most senior people employed pre-nationalisation, 34 (or 68%) have since left the Bank.  I have accepted the Board's position at this time. However, I have asked that the situation in relation to remuneration  be kept under review. I have also conveyed my view that downward pressure is to be exerted in relation to the remuneration packages of any new staff recruited to the bank.

The scheme enabled an employer to purchase a bicycle and certain bicycle-related (safety) accessories for an employee, without the employee being liable for BIK.   The scheme complemented the existing TaxSaver commuter scheme and was intended to encourage more employees to cycle to and from work. In addition to reducing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions, more people cycling to work would improve health and fitness levels.The tax relief on the cost of a bicycle and equipment is allowed once in a period of five years, this being regarded as a reasonable lifespan for a bicycle. The employer would save on employer's PRSI on the value of the benefit provided to the employee; the employee would save on income tax, employee's PRSI and income levies on the value of the benefit received from the employer.It is estimated (from industry figures1) that approx. 30,000 bicycles are sold per year under this scheme. This could suggest a cost to the Exchequer in excess of €5m per annum in gross tax foregone; the actual figure would be dependent on the amount claimed per bike. However a number of offsetting factors need to be borne in mind. The Exchequer receives VAT on cycle sales and jobs are provided in the sales and servicing sector, i.e. bikes continue to need spares, maintenance, etc. Also, it is recognised that increased use of cycling is of value in itself from a health and environmental viewpoint.  1(Irish Bicycle Business Association “Report on the Cycle To Work Scheme Tax Incentive, 14th October, 2011,

While I and my Department are aware of the bank's policy in relation to procurement it is not the practice to establish the cost of each individual arrangement the bank enters into.  That said overall expenditure is monitored on an on-going basis through monthly management accounts, interim accounts and annual reports etc. and matters of concern are raised at an appropriate level.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	382	As the Deputy is aware the Board of the bank is responsible for the day to day operation of the bank. I have no function in relation to routine meetings arranged or attended by staff of the bank, when those meetings took place or the number of staff from the bank attending such meetings.    As the matter of the engagement of the company to which the Deputy refers has been the subject of a considerable number of Parliamentary Questions, it would appear that the Deputy has concerns relating to this engagement.  As of yet, it does not appear that the Deputy is in a position to set out his concerns in a manner that will allow the matter to be comprehensively addressed. If the Deputy is concerned that something untoward has taken place or that some wrongdoing has occurred the Deputy should raise the matter with the relevant authorities. Alternatively, if the Deputy is in a position, having consulted with his sources, to set out his concerns I would be happy to refer the matter to the Board of the bank for consideration.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	388	As the Deputy is aware, the programme is envisaged to run to the end of 2013. All programme funding must be drawn down by that date. While the arrangement regarding the recent March promissory note payment does not affect the programme timeframe, it does mean that the Exchequer has additional cash reserves of €3.06 billion at its disposal.   On the basis that we fully draw-down the remaining EU-IMF funds available under our programme and taking account of the current projections for the State's financing needs, I understand from the NTMA that the programme covers Ireland's financial requirements until the end of 2013.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	389	On the basis of my Department's current budgetary forecasts, Ireland's General Government deficit is expected to be below 3% of GDP in 2015.  The deadline for correcting the excessive deficit was extended to 2015 in December 2010 upon Ireland's entry into the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.The forecasts set out in the 2012 Stability Programme Update are consistent with a General Government Balance of just under — 3% of GDP in 2015. As discussed in the document, the exact size of the structural component of this is, of course, uncertain. Not only do technical estimates differ depending on the approach used, but it is also the case that estimates of the structural balance further out the forecast horizon are not fixed — policies being implemented at present, together with future measures, can be expected to impact positively on the figures.As I have said on a number of occasions, reducing the structural element of the deficit will require policy action, though not necessarily taxation and expenditure adjustments. Other options are available and it is the Government's intention to pursue these. Such measures include labour market reforms, together with investment in technology and infrastructure. By boosting the productive capacity of the economy, the ambitious programme of microeconomic reforms that is already underway is expected to help reduce the structural element of the deficit by the middle part of the decade. For example, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the Pathways to Work  initiative include reforms aimed at addressing some of the skills mis-match in the labour market, which should help lower the unemployment rate. This would have a structurally beneficial impact on the public finances, on both the revenue and expenditure sides. In other words, the structural fiscal position is set to improve with these microeconomic reforms.Under the Stability and Growth Pact, when a country is in excessive deficit (i.e. has a General Government Balance in excess of — 3% of GDP), the focus of the fiscal effort is on reducing the headline deficit to below 3% of GDP. In our case, the time path to achieve this objective is end-2015. Once a country comes out of excessive deficit, the focus is on bringing a country's public finances into line with its agreed medium-term budgetary objective.As discussed in the 2012 Stability Programme Update, Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) currently stands at -0.5% of GDP. This objective was set under the Stability and Growth Pact and well in advance of the Stability Treaty. Furthermore, as noted above, estimates of the structural deficit vary in an Irish context. What we can say is that we are making progress towards the achievement of our MTO, and further progress will be made in the post-2015 period on a phased basis, in accordance with a timeline to be agreed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	391	As part of the reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact, contained in the so-called ‘6-pack' of legislative reforms, Member States with a debt-to-GDP ratio in excess of 60% will have to reduce the part of their debt ratio above the 60% threshold by 1/20th annually. This will have to be done irrespective of the Stability Treaty, though it also forms part of the Treaty.    Ireland and the other Member States currently in excessive deficit on the basis of the deficit criterion are not subject to the debt correction rule at this time. In Ireland's case, we must first stabilise our debt-to-GDP ratio — it is forecast that this will be achieved next year. After coming out of excessive deficit, and as a Programme country, we will be able to avail of a three-year transition period before the full 1/20th rule will apply. This means that Ireland will not be fully bound by the rule until 2019, though in the 2016-18 period, we will need to make ‘sufficient progress' in terms of reducing our debt ratio.  Finally, I would also point out that, when it comes to meeting the debt requirement, it is reasonable to expect that economic growth will do most of the ‘heavy lifting'.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The focus of Government presently is on stabilising the General Government debt to GDP ratio and beginning the process of reducing it to a lower, safer level over time. This will be done through the implementation of further budgetary consolidation as well as policies which foster employment and economic growth.  The recently published Stability Programme Update (SPU) estimates that by the end of current forecast horizon in 2015, the debt to GDP ratio will be 117.4 per cent, down from a peak of 120.3 per cent next year.The debt correction requirement in the Inter-Governmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance
in the Economic and Monetary Union   is to reduce that part of the debt ratio which is above the threshold rate of 60 per cent annually by at least one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.  It is important to remember that this requirement is already part of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. We will have to fulfill this requirement irrespective of the Stability Treaty.  A transition period will apply for all countries, including Ireland, that are currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure. During this transition period, which would last for three years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the requirement under the debt correction rule is deemed to be fulfilled if we are making “sufficient progress” towards compliance.Based on the fiscal projections set out in the recently published SPU, Ireland will be coming out of the excessive deficit procedure by the end of the current forecast horizon as a result of reducing the General Government deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP in 2015. Therefore the three year transition period referred to above will apply. This means that it will be 2019 before the debt correction requirement in the Inter-Governmental Treaty fully kicks in.  As there are presently no specific macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the period post 2015, the exact policies that will be required, as well as the level of paydown of General Government debt that would be required to ensure compliance with the Inter-Governmental Treaty debt correction rule are conjecture at this stage.In terms of the fiscal implications of this debt correction rule, it is important to remember that it is the debt to GDP debt ratio that is important, not the overall nominal level of General Government debt. In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions over the medium-term, we can expect economic growth to do much of the work in this regard.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	393	At 60%, the target debt-to-GDP ratio set out in the Fiscal Compact is in line with the reference value for the debt ratio contained in the Stability and Growth Pact. So irrespective of the Stability Treaty, we — like all EU Member States — are committed to reducing our debt-to-GDP ratio to the 60% reference value. This will be achieved over time, and it is reasonable to expect that growth will do most of the ‘heavy lifting' in this respect.  Such a target is designed to inter alia  ensure that the borrowing requirements of governments do not crowd out private investment (e.g. by pushing up interest rates), to reduce uncertainty and to help secure the long-term sustainability of the public finances.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	394	There is no requirement to bring the debt to GDP ratio to 25 per cent.  The debt correction requirement in the Inter-Governmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance
in the Economic and Monetary Union   is to reduce that part of the debt ratio which is above the threshold rate of 60 per cent annually by at least one-twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate.  It is important to remember that this requirement is already part of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. We will have to fulfill this requirement irrespective of the Stability Treaty.  I am aware of the analysis published, which shows that on the basis of certain assumptions, including regarding the deficit in the public finances and nominal economic growth rates, public debt could converge to a low level in the long-run.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The VAT Directive does not make specific provision for a reduced or zero rate to apply to safety equipment, including life saving equipment, and as such they are subject to the standard VAT rate, which is currently 23%.  However, for historic reasons the zero rate of VAT applies to safety clothing, including lifejackets, for children up to 10 years of age, while the supply of such clothing for adults and children older than 10 years is liable to VAT at the 23% rate.  As Ireland applied the zero rate to clothing and protective clothing for children up to 10 years of age on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to retain that zero rated application.  However, as the standard VAT rate applied to safety equipment and safety clothing for adults and older children at 1 January 1991, it is not possible to apply a reduced or zero rate to them.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	396	As regards the recommendations for improvement to the budgetary process, to a large extent these recommendations have been superseded by the major reforms introduced since this Government took office in 2011.  In the first instance, the establishment of an entirely separate Department of Public Expenditure and Reform introduces a new focus upon issues of expenditure management, and incorporates a unified focus upon public service reform and innovation.  In the Medium Term Fiscal Statement of November 2011, the Government mapped out its fiscal plan on a multi-annual basis, setting out the overall level of budgetary consolidation it is estimated is required to adhere to budgetary targets as well as the split between revenue and expenditure measures for each of the years out to 2015.  In the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 which was published by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in December 2011, a new Medium Term Expenditure Framework has been established, with multi-annual expenditure ceilings laid down for all Departments.  The expenditure ceilings, which are fully consistent with the Government’s agreed overall fiscal policy, replace the old-fashioned and incremental estimates processes which were subject to criticism in the Wright Report.  In July 2011, the Government established the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council ("Fiscal Council") on a non-statutory basis.  The functions assigned to the Council encompass the proposals made in the Report.  In the period since its establishment, the Fiscal Council has published two fiscal assessments and a report on strengthening Ireland's fiscal framework.  Provision for the establishment of the Fiscal Council on a statutory basis is included in the General Scheme of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill published on 26 April 2012 in the context of the referendum on the ratification of the Fiscal Stability Treaty.  The Fiscal Council is assigned the function of monitoring compliance by the Government with the budgetary rules set out in the Treaty.A senior HR Manager was appointed to my Department in September 2011.  Measures have been taken to increase the complement of skilled staff in areas such as economics, banking, financial services and policy analysis.  Within the context of the Department's Employment Control Framework (ECF), my Department has examined the skill level of staff and has addressed the issue via a combination of direct employment and secondment.  The Department is currently in the process of being restructured by the Secretary General, John Moran who was appointed on 6 March 2012, to meet the fiscal and economic challenges ahead.  A revised Statement of Strategy has been approved and a new organisational structure is being rolled out that is focused towards the identification and implementation of measures that will contribute to enhanced confidence and delivering sustainable growth in our economy.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the expected yield from Carbon Tax in 2012 is €370.7 million (excluding VAT).  It is the general practice not to ring-fence revenues for specific purposes but rather take an overall view on priorities in the context of expenditure decisions which, of course, are dependent on Exchequer revenues.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of revenue raised by betting duty in each of the past five years is as follows:Year€200736,437,009200836,667,784200930,988,780201030,919,211201127,096,522It was announced in Budget 2011 that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops.  This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State.  This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets.  The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a tax on the commission charged.  In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers' and remote betting intermediaries' licences.The proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences.  The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. This Bill is well advanced and it is hoped that it will be published in the second quarter of this year.  I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.  In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland.  A location with an appropriate licensing regime coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector, which ultimately can potentially be beneficial to all concerned.

Each member is assigned a quota, broadly based on its size relative to the world economy.  A member's quota determines its maximum financial commitment to the IMF, its voting power, and has a bearing on its access to IMF financing. Quotas are denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs*), the IMF's unit of account.Ireland's IMF quota is currently SDR 1,257.6 million, or 0.528% of the total quota share of the IMF, since 4 March 2011 when the 2008 Quota Review came into force.   Details of transactions on the Central Bank's IMF accounts are set out in the Annual Report on Ireland's Participation in the IMF and the World Bank (available at www.finance.gov.ie).  Ireland’s quota is due to increase to SDR 3,449.9 million, or 0.724% of the total quota share of the IMF, when the 2010 Quota changes are implemented.  The 2010 reforms need to be approved by the IMF Board of Governors which requires acceptance by 113 member countries representing 85 percent of the total voting power.*At 27 April 2012  1 euro = SDR 0.85381

However, as Irish Life is now in public ownership, Eurostat attached a reservation to our Maastricht Returns in which it raised concerns about the private sector ownership of the NAMA SPV and consequently the treatment of NAMA for the purposes of calculating General Government Debt.  My Department has notified Eurostat that the sale of the Irish Life shareholding in the NAMA SPV to private investors has been agreed and it is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in the coming weeks.  As a consequence, we expect that the Eurostat treatment of the NAMA SPV will be unchanged.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	402	The Credit Review Office (CRO) was established under Section 210(1)(b) of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 and commenced operations in April 2010. The CRO reviews decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from €1,000 up to €500,000.  Each review will only apply to a specific declined credit application up to €500,000 and not to any other borrowings which may exist.  Therefore, applicants who may have total borrowings above this limit are not excluded from the review process.  The tables below illustrate the activity of the CRO up to 29 February 2012, the date of the most recent CRO quarterly report:Application Rec’d but held at Office until eligibility confirmed with BankOverturned by Internal Appeals / got credit*Abandoned / Withdrawn by customer**Application Received and proceeding through Review processCRO DecisionTotalBanks’ Credit Decision UpheldBank’s Credit Decision Disputed / Bank Subsequently Provided Credit More work required by Borrower and Bank or withdrawn by customerAIB46642327,878BoI47652026,775Total8131294353,151.53**** only tracked since May 2011-new procedures**considered withdrawn/abandoned if no response after 6 months***includes applications awaiting eligibility confirmationFormal AppealsBanks’ Credit Decision UpheldJobs at riskBank’s Credit Decision Disputed / Bank Provided CreditJobs protectedTotal Numbers€3,798,553228+22p/t€4,747,000521+21p/tAIB€1,803,200131+9p/t€2,258,300218+9p/tBoI€1,995,75397+13p/t€2,488,700303+12p/tAnother function of the CRO is to assist my Department in monitoring the progress of the pillar banks in achieving their lending targets.  In his fifth quarterly report of August 2011 the Credit Reviewer stated that it would be a challenge for each of the banks to reach their €3bn sanction target for new and restructured facilities.  Following publication of the report, some robust meetings took place between the CRO, the Department of Finance and the pillar banks, which resulted in increased lending activity in the following two quarters and the annual targets being met.The main aim of the CRO is to ensure that credit is not refused to viable businesses with valid credit propositions. Insofar as this aim is concerned, I consider that a satisfactory solution has been found in all cases.  I would also advise the Deputy that the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 contains a commitment to assess the CRO to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require. It is intended to commence this process shortly.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.As I have stated before, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012.  The original version of the Treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July and 9 December 2011 aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.  It also reflects the political decisions reached among leaders at their informal meeting on 30 January concerning the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (Stability Treaty) in the Economic and Monetary Union.In my previous replies to the Deputy on this issue, I outlined that our approach to these negotiations was informed by the need to secure agreement on the revised ESM Treaty, including the additional flexibilities and the commitment to a review of its capacity. We viewed these as positive developments which are in Europe's interest and in Ireland's interest.  The linkage between the ESM and Stability Treaty ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its accelerated entry into force by July 2012.  In the negotiations, the Government sought to ensure that it was made clear that the link between ratification of the Stability Treaty and the ESM Treaty applied only to new applications for assistance under the ESM, and that it will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries.  The Government also sought to ensure that sufficient time was provided for ratification of the Stability Treaty before the link enters into effect.The Stability Treaty is part of a broader package of measures aimed at improving confidence in the Euro Area, which include the ESM. It is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty. That is the basis of the linkage. We believe the linkage between the Treaties will further contribute to confidence, solidarity and financial stability in the euro area.  These measures have the collective aim of restoring market confidence to the EU as a whole.  Our approach to the discussions on these issues was informed, inter alia, by that concern.The basis on which we agreed to the linkage is outlined above, as it was in previous replies to the Deputy on this issue.  Finally, I would remind the Deputy that the decision to hold a referendum on the Stability Treaty was taken, on the basis of advice from AG's, once discussions on the Stability Treaty had concluded.

VAT registered farmers are therefore eligible to recover VAT incurred on diesel as a business input.Farmers who are not registered for VAT are not entitled to recover VAT, including that charged by VAT registered contractors, and are not required to charge VAT on their sales. However, these farmers are compensated under the farmers' flat-rate scheme for the VAT incurred on their purchases by means of a 5.2% flat-rate addition to the prices at which they sell their agricultural produce and services to VAT-registered traders.  In addition, farmers who are not registered for VAT may be entitled to a refund under the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order 1993 for tax borne on the construction of farm buildings, fencing, drainage and reclamation of farm land.

With regard to the Marlborough Street complex the Deputy should note that this complex consists of a number of buildings including older listed stone buildings such as Tyrone House (built circa 1740) which are not energy efficient.A Display Energy Certificate is in the process of being produced for my Department's Athlone office.  This process was delayed due to the recent conversion from oil boilers to more efficient gas boilers.  It is expected that a certificate will issue to be completed within the next month.  The combined fuel and gas costs for the three sites in 2011 was €139,548.51.In relation to the three independent higher level institutions referred to in the question the Deputy should note that (a) obtaining and displaying a Display Energy Certificate (incorporating a BER rating) and (b) payment of heating costs are both administrative matters for the individual bodies themselves.  Accordingly the information requested is not collated centrally within my  Department.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am informed that the level of new FÁS apprentice entrants (registrations) by employers reduced significantly in the period 2006-2011 from 8,306 to 1,307.  There was a slight increase in registrations from 1,204 in 2010 to 1,307 in 2011.  In 2012, FÁS apprenticeship programmes will continue to be provided for an estimated 1,200 new registrants and more generally for an existing apprentice population of approximately 13,000 at various stages of their apprenticeship.   To assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeship FÁS has put the following interim measures in place:The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme (RAPS) provides opportunities for  redundant apprentices to complete the minimum duration for off-the-job training  and assessment with FÁS approved employers for Phase 3, Phase 5 and Phase 7 of  the standard based apprenticeship programme.  The scheme provides apprentices with a weekly training allowance to complete the minimum period of 26 weeks at Phase 3 and Phase 5 or the minimum period of 12 weeks at Phase 7.  Currently there are 559 redundant apprentices on the scheme with employers, with 31 having completed their training and assessments.A change in rules to allow progression without completing on-the-job elements  and to recognise prior learning have been developed to tackle the issue of the lack of availability of on-the-job components of apprenticeships.FÁS has introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM) (this mechanism  will provide redundant apprentices with the opportunity to demonstrate their  skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for the specified trade  over a number of days in a FÁS Training Centre) to enable eligible redundant  apprentices initially in the trades of Brick and Stonelaying, Carpentry and Joinery, Electrical, Plastering, Plumbing and Cabinet Making to progress towards the completion of their apprenticeship.  Those who successfully pass the Competency Determination Mechanism will be progressed for the award of the FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate — Craft.Refresher Programme for Redundant Referred Apprentices To assist referred apprentices who wish to progress, FÁS and the Institutes of Technology have developed a short duration programme to prepare redundant  apprentices to repeat their outstanding assessments. This programme will be offered by the Institutes of Technology in from November 2012.Fee Waiver Scheme Course fees will be waived for redundant apprentices who attend FÁS day and/or evening courses in order to enhance their employable skills.If a FÁS registered apprentice's employment has been terminated due to insufficient work being available he/she should:Inform FÁS Services to Business immediately of his/her redundant status.Register with the local DSP Employment Services Office for assistance in securing new employment to enable him/her to continue their apprenticeship training.Information regarding employment vacancies can also be accessed by telephoning Jobs Ireland at Freephone 1 800 611 116.Keep FÁS Services to Business informed of all details relating to his/her apprenticeship employment with a FÁS approved employer so that this time may be credited in calculating the finish date of his/her apprenticeship.In the Deputy's question he makes reference to a specific individual and I can confirm to the Deputy that the individual in question has been placed on the Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme (RAPS) with a named employer since the 23rd April, 2012.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process.  The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.There is an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board met on 18th and 19th April. A total of 367 schools submitted appeals to the Appeals Board.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support which now includes a requirement for them to have regard to the overall cap on numbers.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.In considering applications for SNA support for the new school year, the NCSE will take into account the individual care needs of all qualifying children, supports freed up due to any school leavers, and the identified care needs of newly enrolled children with special educational needs.  The NCSE will advise the school by late May/early June of their SNA allocation for the 2012/13 school year.

The building project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The design team are currently working on completing the stage 2(b) submission which will then be submitted to my Department for review.  For the purposes of the 5 Year construction programme new school building projects as well as major extensions have been prioritised on the basis of meeting demographic needs in areas where such needs have been identified.  Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the funding available each year for the provision of school accommodation to meet the increasing demographic requirements it has not been possible to advance all projects to construction concurrently.

The assignment of the staff has helped to reduce the period of the backlog significantly.  Applications received in October 2011 are currently being processed in date order of receipt and every effort is being made, within the resources available, to process these applications as quickly as possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of the employment control framework it is only possible to reassign limited staffing resources from within the existing staff cohort of my Department to deal with redundancy payments whilst at the same time ensuring that other priority functions such the payment of teachers on a fortnightly basis continues.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	412	My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools and post primary schools within the free education scheme.   As the Deputy is aware Budget 2012 provided for a 2% reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools in both 2012 and 2013 and a further 1% in 2014 and 2015.Due to my decision of 21st February last, to retain posts from previous disadvantage schemes in DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 primary schools, it was necessary to generate alternative savings within the primary education budget.  This has been achieved by bringing forward to this year 1.5% of the 2% reduction in overall capitation funding originally scheduled for 2013.  The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc.   With regard to the VEC sector financial allocations are made to VECs as part of a block grant.  VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants.  Fee charging schools do not receive any capitation or related grants from my Department.  The capitation rates requested by the Deputy are set out in the following tables. 1: Post Primary Grants.

Students who are entitled to free fees must pay a student contribution charge to their higher education institution.Under my Department's student grant scheme, eligible candidates may receive funding provided they are attending an approved course at an approved institution as defined in the relevant scheme.  Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for financial assistance where they satisfy the relevant conditions including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  Students qualifying for a grant will also have their fees and/or student contribution paid on their behalf.Springboard is a specific initiative to provide free part time higher education places targeted at unemployed people who have lost their jobs as a result of the recession and who would benefit from upskilling or reskilling in order to get back into sustainable employment.  Since it was launched in May 2011 almost 5,000 unemployed people have been supported to undertake higher education courses under the Springboard programme.  The roll out of Springboard 2012 is now underway and a new range of Springboard courses will be launched in the coming weeks.In addition, as one of the measures included in the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan to boost the domestic supply of ICT graduates for Irish employment opportunities, more than 760 free places have been provided on 17 new graduate skills conversion programmes.  The programmes are targeted at jobseekers who would have the capacity and underlying aptitude, as well as an honours degree in a cognate discipline, to undergo an intensive programme of study and work experience to acquire honours degree level ICT programming skills.

The staffing arrangements reflect the requirement for schools to manage the provision of subjects and the provision of guidance from within the standard staffing allocation.  The details are set out in Department Circular 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website.In accordance with these arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.  My Department is currently in the process of notifying schools of the outcome of their applications for curricular concessions.  The allocation processes at post primary level also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The final staffing position for all schools at post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.

Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions.  The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.  The eligibility of an applicant, or the level of the grant awarded, may be re-assessed by the awarding authority in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year.  The applicant should in the first instance contact the relevant awarding body and notify them of the change in circumstances.I have no plans at present to depart from the above practice in respect of the determination of income.  In addition, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  The access offices themselves also provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.  My Department engages on an on-going basis with other Government Departments in relation to student supports.

The Government believes that this cost should be shared on a 50:50 basis, between the State and those who were responsible for the management of institutions.  The contribution of the 18 congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement amounted to €128 million.  They have since committed to contribute some €110 million to the proposed Statutory Fund for former residents, of which €21.05m has already been received.  They have also offered properties they valued at a further €235.5m to different State bodies and voluntary organisations.  Of the properties offered to the State, 12 have been identified as of potential immediate benefit and the transfer of these properties is being pursued.  The value of these 12 properties, based on the congregations' own valuations is approximately €60m.This House will be aware of my disappointment at the congregations' offers which fall well short of realising a 50:50 sharing of the costs of the response to residential institutional abuse.  I am continuing to pursue the 50:50 division with the management bodies involved and have proposed the transfer of school infrastructure to the State for the benefit of the taxpayer as one mechanism to allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs.

This Anti-Bullying Forum is due to take place on the 17th of May 2012 and will bring together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector including parents and students.  It is envisaged that there will be a range of speakers on the day of the Forum which will include contributions from my Department, the National Anti-Bullying Coalition (NABC), an acknowledged academic or other expert in the field of anti-bullying and contributors from the school sector from the various perspectives of school principal, parent and pupils.  The Forum will also give other stakeholders an opportunity to give their views.The objective of the Forum will be to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.  Bullying is a problem I take very seriously and I hope that the Forum will provide an opportunity to set out a road map on how best to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.I am also establishing a working group on tackling bullying.  The outcomes and recommendations from the Forum will assist the working group in its deliberations.  This working group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and will draw upon the expertise of a range of organisations throughout their work.  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the first phase to be addressed by the Working Group will be homophobic bullying.

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application form and supporting documentation, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student should qualify for a grant.  Where a grant application is refused, the reason for the refusal is given by the grant awarding authority.  An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant awarding authority.  Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.  No appeal has been received in my Department to date in this case.

A meeting was also recently arranged between SOUND and the State Exam Commission.  A central contact point has been established for SOUND with the State Exam Commission, to address issues in relation to the reasonable accommodations which can be made for children with narcolepsy who are taking state exams this year, and I understand that arrangements are being put in place in this regard, where required.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	435	For the Deputy's information:In March 2012 the Irish Research Council was established.  This new Council is a merger of the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET).  This has resulted in a saving of €100,000 in salary costs.Since September 2011, the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) is within the remit of Dublin West Education Centre alongside the Department's largest support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).In June 2011, the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board transferred to the newly established office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of major structural reform projects that are being progressed in the Education sector.  These are:  1) The establishment of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland which involves merger of the National Qualifications Authority, FETAC and HETAC.  These amalgamating bodies have already made major savings in preparation for amalgamation.  The purpose of the agency is in making awards in further and higher education, administering the National Framework of Qualifications and quality assuring education and training providers.  The amount expected to be saved by the merger is in the region of €1 million annually. 2) The amalgamation of 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs)/establishment of 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  The ETBs will take over the work of VECs and will have an expanded role in the delivery of further education and training across the country.  The new bodies will be better positioned to establish shared services and to provide support services to schools not just within the VEC sector but to primary schools and other second level schools in their areas.  They can contribute significantly to driving in particular an agenda of encouraging  aggregated procurement of supplies and services.  Departmental estimates suggest that by 2016 following full implementation, savings of the order of €3.2million can be made annually. 3) The establishment of SOLAS, the new agency to reform, co-ordinate and fund further education and training programmes including developing a seamless interaction with the National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) on activation measures. 4) A single awarding authority for student grants.  City of Dublin VEC will operate as the new single student grant awarding authority to replace the existing 66 grant awarding bodies.  Implementation of the new arrangements is being phased in from 2012/13 academic year. 5) It is also proposed to dissolve the Education Finance Board on the establishment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund.  The purpose of this agency is to pay education grants to former residents and their relatives from the €12.7m provided by the religious congregations pursuant to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement.  The recently published Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill 2012 provides for the dissolution of the EFB and the transfer of its functions in relation to the remaining moneys available to the new Residential Institutions Statutory Fund. 6) The consolidation of Higher Education provision under the Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	436	This Government has protected education as much as it can.  Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools.  But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford.The budget measures in relation to the staffing schedule were focused on small primary schools.  The Government fully recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a major feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable in difficult and challenging times.  Teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.As part of the new staffing arrangements small primary schools that were due to lose a classroom post under the budget measure and who are now projecting increased enrolments for September 2012 were given access to the appeals process.  Schools that were projecting increased enrolments to the required levels had their appeals provisionally upheld by the Staffing Appeals Board at its recent meeting.  The retention of these classroom posts will be subject to confirmation of the actual pupil numbers in these schools in September.

The school authorities have recently requested additional funding associated with this building project.  The application is currently being assessed and the school authorities will be notified of the decision shortly.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	438	My priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access to undergraduate higher education courses despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances.  As a result, no changes were made to the eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in Budget 2012. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.  Nevertheless, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to any maintenance payment under the Student Grant Scheme. Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level.  This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold.  The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.  Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.  Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.In addition to this, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  Also the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.While it is regrettable that any changes need to be made to student supports, I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students and allow us to maintain the high level of supports provided to undergraduate students.I take it that the Deputy's reference to fees relates to the level of Student Contribution.  In order for this country to adhere to its agreed economic recovery programme and to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015 it is necessary to seek to reduce expenditure across all areas of the Department.  As with student supports, this involves difficult decisions including the decision in Budget 2012 to increase the Student Contribution to €2,250 for the 2012/13 academic year.  While the Government considered a range of saving options for the 2012-2015 period as part of the budget process last year, final decisions have not been made in respect of student contribution increases for 2013 and beyond.  More savings will have to be found and further increases to the student contribution in future years cannot be ruled out.  This is one of the options that was included in the Department's Comprehensive Expenditure Report, published last December.In recognition of the financial pressures that the student contribution may place on families, this Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA) requested higher education institutions to consider putting in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the student contribution in two instalments in a given academic year.  It should be noted that the student contribution is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the Department's Student Grant Scheme.  Tax relief is also available for second and subsequent siblings to alleviate the costs for families.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an application for a new school building from the school to which he refers.  The school authority in question has identified a site which it considers suitable as a location for the construction of a permanent building for the school.  However, the site in question is not currently serviced and is not immediately accessible.  Instead, it forms part of a larger site which is undeveloped and is unlikely to be developed in the near future.The cost of providing infrastructure to the proposed school site would be significant.  As such, this site is not considered a viable option for any school until the adjoining lands are developed so that the full cost of providing services and infrastructure to the entire site is not borne by my Department or the relevant VEC.  As outlined in the Five Year Plan, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet future demographic demands, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  The Deputy will appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.

As the scope of works for which funding is sought is outside the terms of the scheme it cannot be considered for funding. The school authority has been informed of this decision.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five year programme announced recently is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  Other school building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on my Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to indicate when this project will progress to tender and construction stage.

With effect from the 2011/2012 academic year, a new student contribution charge was introduced in higher education. This charge replaced the Student Services Charge and applies to all full-time students who currently benefit under the "free fees" scheme.Where students are not eligible for free tuition fees, including students attending part-time course, they are liable to pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution. Such institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, the level of fees to be charged in such cases is a matter for the institution concerned.  As the Deputy may also be aware, tax relief is available at the standard rate of taxation in respect of expenditure on fees associated with part-time higher education.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish Sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science (Skills) to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:the special schools for the deaf/hearing impaired have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.The Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly. Services provided include communication therapy and lip reading classes as well as sign language classes.Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision. This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie. My Department is currently establishing a working group to consider and implement the recommendations of this report.

At that point, the Department of Health/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years. My Department, at that stage, may allocate resources towards an education component of such provision.  The policy of my Department is that Special Schools may make an application to my Department to retain pupils over the age of 18 who are pursuing courses leading to accreditation at level 3 or above of the National Qualifications Framework (Junior Certificate/Leaving Certificate Applied/FETAC 3); for one additional year, in order to complete these courses.I can confirm that my Department has received an application from St. Anne's Special School seeking to retain the pupil referred to by the Deputy for an extra year, and my Department will revert to the school authorities  regarding this application shortly.

As previously stated in my reply to the Deputy in Parliamentary Question Number 394 of 18th April 2012, reckonable income for student grants purposes is gross income from all sources whether it arises in the State or not. It includes income from pensions.  Officials of my Department have been in contact with the VEC concerned and I understand that the applicant applied as a dependent mature student when he commenced his study.  His application is therefore assessed based on his parents' income and that of his own.The applicant is already in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance from the Department of Social Protection in respect of his living costs.  In addition, he was awarded a part fee grant under the Student Grant Scheme based on the reckonable income details submitted.  If the applicant is not satisfied with the rate of fee grant awarded by the grant awarding authority, that decision may be appealed to the awarding authority's appeals officer. Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.

I am advised that a single bank account was used for the by-election, the Presidential Election and the Referendums, which were held simultaneously. General costs, such as staff, premises, preparation etc will apply to all of these events and as such it will not be clear from the final accounts which costs relate specifically to the by-election.However, I have been informed that some €92,000 in costs were incurred by the Returning Officer purely as a result of the by-election. This includes Returning Officer fees, fees for one additional Poll Clerk per ballot box, count staff, clerical and administration costs. In addition, some €274,707 was incurred for the free-postage scheme for candidates and some €10,460 was incurred by OPW.

These are the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (PEACE) and the INTERREG Programme.  The current PEACE III Programme (2007-2013) has a total allocation of 333m euro and INTERREG IVA (2007-2013) has an allocation of 256m euro.  Both Programmes are co-funded by the EU Commission, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government.  The INTERREG Programme also receives some funding from Scottish partners, as parts of western Scotland are covered by the Programme.  The Programmes are managed by Special EU Programmes Body, a North South body established under the Good Friday Agreement and sponsored jointly by my Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland.The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was created in order to build a more peaceful and stable society across the region.  Over the past 15 years, thousands of individual projects, all working towards this objective, have been supported under the programme.  The INTERREG IVA Programme aims to foster a more prosperous and sustainable region.  It builds on the success of previous programmes and supports beneficial collaborations in a range of areas such as tourism, enterprise, environment, rural development and health.

The security service was part of the building management service and not a separate tender competition. The management service will be re-advertised and tendered publicly this year. The security aspect of the service contract will again be part of the tender.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Recommendation 62.15 of the Moriarty Tribunal Report (March 2011) is that the Standards Commission could appoint an inspector to audit the financial affairs of an office holder, within the meaning of the Ethics Acts, by the voluntary and positive election of the office holder, at any time during his/her period in office and for a defined period thereafter.  I am examining another possible approach, namely, to allow the Standards Commission to audit an office holder's financial affairs, but only in the case of an investigation by the Commission of the office holder for an infringement of the Ethics Acts or the Electoral Acts involving his personal financial affairs.   Such an approach would allow an office holder's financial affairs to be audited where there is a real concern about standards in public life.Following the recent Government Decision responding to the Mahon Tribunal, I am reviewing the detailed set of recommendations contained in the Mahon Report related to ethics as well as those contained in the Moriarty Report in order to formulate proposals for those recommendations falling to this Department to progress.  In that context, I will consider in consultation with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government and the Attorney General what steps may be necessary in terms of root-and-branch reworking of the ethics framework.

The full year heating costs for 2011 were €37,470.  The Office of Public Works are responsible for the payment of utility bills for Áras an Uachtaráin. They have informed me that the annual heating costs for the premises for 2011 were €59,229.  Both Government Buildings and Áras an Uachtaráin are exempt from requiring BER certification as they are protected structures.  Payment of heating costs for the National Convention Centre is not a matter for my Department or the Office of Public Works.

The new licence will involve an upfront payment to the State, with some of the payment being used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Children's Hospital. The ongoing provision of a fixed percentage of annual lottery turnover for good causes will be a condition of the licence. The Government has decided that this percentage is to be retained at 30.5% which was the level that was achieved in 2011.  I consider that where the State identifies opportunities to generate additional revenues that do not impact on taxpayers, we need to pursue them.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	461	With regard to the number of bodies and agencies under my aegis, I refer the Deputy to my answer to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald (PQ Ref No: 5539/12) on 31 January 2012 which lists the bodies and agencies of each Department.  Those Offices of State etc., who have their own Vote (see Appendix 1) and for which I am responsible are:Vote 13 — Office of Public Works.Vote 14 — State Laboratory.Vote 16 — Valuation Office.Vote 17 — Public Appointments Service.Vote 18 — Commission for Public Service Appointments.Vote 19 — Office of the Ombudsman.Regarding proposals for the review of operation of these bodies, as the Deputy will be aware, the Public Service Reform   Report, published in November 2011, outlined the programme of public service reforms and improvements which are designed to deliver the commitments made in the Programme for Government.  The radical streamlining of state bodies is a key element in the reform programme and to this end, the Report listed 48 bodies which are due to be rationalised by end 2012 and a further 46 bodies which are to be critically reviewed by June 2012.  The Commission on Public Service Appointments, which is due to be merged with Office of the Ombudsman, is listed as one of the 48 bodies to be rationalised by end of 2012.Those bodies which are under my Department and which are listed for critical review by June include:National Development Finance Agency   (Merge National Development Finance Agency in to OPW/National Procurement Service).Valuation Office   (Merge the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey).Disciplinary Code of Appeals Board and the Independent Mediator    (Abolish/Merge with new employment rights body listed under Appendix IIa of the Public Service Reform Plan).State Laboratory   (Merge Forensic Science Laboratory Medical Bureau of Road Safety into State Laboratory).Office of the Ombudsman (Amalgamate Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with the Office of the Ombudsman.  There are also a number of related actions including merging the functions of the Language Commissioner and merging the back-office functions of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children into the Office of the Ombudsman).
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  Current guidelines including Circular 10/10 —"Facilitating SME Participation in Public Procurement" issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:works and related services contracts with an estimated value of €50,000 or more to be advertised on the www.etenders.gov.ie website.  While there is no requirement to advertise works projects below €50,000 on www.etenders.gov.ie   or elsewhere, the principle of transparency and non-discrimination still needs to be satisfied.  Where a Contracting Authority does not advertise for projects below €50,000 and has satisfied the principles in some other way, five firms should be invited to tender with the expectation that five tenders will be submitted;all public works and related services contracts up to €250,000 to be procured using an "Open" procedure, an "Open" procedure admits all contractors to the tendering stage providing they meet the minimum qualification standards set by the contracting authority;ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract.  National guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects are published on the Capital Works Management Framework available at www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie. These guidelines take account of the principles of transparency, proportionality and fairness under the EU Treaty;permitting applicants to pre-qualify on the basis of self-declaring that they meet the qualification criteria without having to submit all of the required evidence which can be a significant administrative burden for an SME.  Evidence in support of the declarations is only sought at the contract award stage; and sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.All policy, guidance and implementation measures relating to capital projects are published on the Construction Procurement Reform website www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie   where the Capital Works Management Framework provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents are available to download for all contracting authorities to provide a consistent approach to the management of public works projects.Tendering is dealt with through a range of guidance notes and template documents such as Suitability Assessment Questionnaires, Instructions to Tenderers and Forms of Tender which may be downloaded and modified to suit each particular tender competition.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	464	My Department has responsibility for e-working policy in the civil service.  This is outlined in Circular 4/2003: Pilot schemes to promote e-working in the civil service. Most government departments introduced pilot e-working schemes.In 2009, the Minister for Transport published "Smarter Travel: A Sustainable Transport Future” which represented a new transport policy for Ireland for the period 2009-2020. As part of the Smarter Travel Policy Framework, an interdepartmental working group, comprising of representatives from the then Departments of Transport, Finance, Enterprise Trade and Employment, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Environment Heritage and Local Government, HSE and the Office of Public Works was established to consider how best to progress the issue of e-working in the civil and public service.  The conclusion of that working group was that although e-working was technologically feasible, it was likely that progress would be (a) over the long term as the public service engages in a process of transformative change and (b) through the initiatives of individual departments or agencies in promotinge-working as an accepted practice.The transformation agenda accepted by both parties to the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 recognises that previously agreed work-life balance policies and arrangements may need to be reviewed and revised in the context of more integrated public services operating with a reduced cohort of staff. Under any such review of these arrangements, options for e-working may be considered where feasible. This would be a matter for each public service body to consider in light of their own business requirements.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 305 together.Vodafone Ireland announced on 22 March that it had completed a review of the company's contracted mobile call-centre operations.  As a result of this review, the company adopted a new model for its mobile customer care, resulting in a move to a new provider, Teleperformance.  Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin have entered a six-week consultation process with employee representatives.  With effect from 8 May, 27 Vodafone roles and 290 Rigney Dolphin contract roles will transfer to Teleperformance.  Rigney Dolphin will remain a provider to Vodafone for other purposes.  I have been assured by Vodafone Ireland that the transfer of service will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.I recently met with Vodafone Ireland and the company has confirmed that it is likely that work will move to the Teleperformance site in Newry. I also met representatives of the workers, their Union and local public representatives. I understand this transfer process will be a matter for Teleperformance, although Vodafone will continue to participate in the consultation period.  I understand that Vodafone has agreed with Teleperformance that in the event of a move to Newry, all affected Vodafone and Rigney Dolphin employees will have the option to transfer to Newry when their role relocates.  Teleperformance have guaranteed that terms and conditions will carry forward to Newry for those who choose to move, and alternatives for those who choose not to transfer will be discussed through the consultation process.  While the situation that has arisen on this occasion is regrettable, it is nevertheless reflective of the competitive forces that affect the sector concerned.In my meeting with Vodafone, the company made it clear that this decision has been taken for commercial reasons and they are not in a position to reverse it. The company have indicated that the work which they have on fixed line customer service is not under review and is performing well.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Moriarty Tribunal made two recommendations for changes to company law, as follows:That a provision similar to section 172 of the UK Companies Act, 2006 be adopted, together with the adoption of additional implementation or enforcement measures.That consideration be given by the Oireachtas, and/or by the Company Law Review Group, to enacting provisions similar to those contained in Part 14 of the UK Companies Act, 2006, governing the control of political donations and expenditure.The Government considered that provisions in the forthcoming Companies Bill, which will consolidate and give a statutory footing to the duties of directors, meet the objectives of the first recommendation above.  The first, and main, part of the Companies Bill, including the provisions on directors' duties, was published in "soft copy" in May 2011.  With regard to the second recommendation above, the Government intends to impose restrictions on corporate donations within electoral, and not company law. Accordingly, provisions to this effect are contained in the Electoral Amendment (Political Funding) Bill, which comes within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and which is currently before the Oireachtas.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	469	There are two major elements to the Government's response to unemployment —Pathways to Work and the Action Plan for Jobs.  The aim of Pathways to Work is to develop a new approach to engaging with people on the Live Register, particularly those who are long-term unemployed.  The public employment services are being reformed as part of this process, to provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.   Pathways to Work includes the objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placement/work experience places to be delivered in 2012 by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Action Plan for Jobs underpins the work of the enterprise development agencies under my Department's remit, which provides a range of supports to companies including in the areas of interest to the Deputy.Specifically targeting communities, a new Community Enterprise Centre (CEC) Development Programme has been developed for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Action Community and Enterprise Ltd manages two Enterprise Centres in Bawnogue and Neilstown which accommodate 42 small enterprises that account for 143 jobs. Enterprise Ireland has also supported the recent refurbishment of the Neilstown Enterprise Centre under the previous CEC Development Scheme 2007/09.I understand that applications have been made under the current CEC programme for funding for Business Development Managers for Neilstown, Killinarden and Bolbrook/Brookfield Enterprise Centres.  The decision on applications for funding will be announced in June.  In 2011, South Dublin County Enterprise Board assisted 38 projects to the value of €357,682 which resulted in the creation of 45 jobs.  464 training participants availed of South Dublin CEB training/mentoring courses in 2011.  During 2012, South Dublin CEB will continue to support enterprise development in the area through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at county level.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14391	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is an international trade agreement that aims to help countries work together to tackle more effectively large-scale Intellectual Property Rights violations by clamping down on counterfeiting and piracy. It aims to strike a fair balance between the interests of the parties concerned, including citizens, consumers, civil society and business; and to guarantee all safeguards and exemptions provided by existing or European norms, such as fundamental rights, privacy and freedom of speech.  Ireland, along with 21 other Member States signed ACTA on 26 January 2012.Following public concerns regarding ACTA, the Commission has decided to refer the Agreement to the Court of Justice of the European Union to assess whether it is in any way incompatible with the EU's fundamental principles in particular with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Commission Legal Service is currently finalising the written submission that will accompany the question.MEPs are democratically elected to represent the citizens of the European Union and act independently in that role in the EU Parliament. As a Member of the European Parliament and a representative of the people of Europe, it is their responsibility to fully inform themselves of the merit of this Agreement for the people of Europe prior to any vote. Accordingly, my Department is available to provide MEPs with background briefing should that be required.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	471	In order to progress the commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs concerning Government charges on business (Action 1.15), I wrote to my Ministerial colleagues in March, asking them to examine all charges which are levied on business by their Departments and associated bodies, with a view to identifying which of these costs can be reduced or frozen to the end of 2013 or beyond.  It is a matter for each Department or agency, where appropriate, to consider the potential for reducing rental costs as part of this exercise.  The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act 2009 abolished upward-only rent reviews for all new leases signed on or after 28 February 2010.As far as my own Department is concerned, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development operate significant property portfolios.  While both agencies hold leases that pre-date 28 February 2010, the IDA Ireland and Shannon Development have confirmed that, where businesses are in difficulty, they have, on a case by case basis, responded to and facilitated companies' requests for reduced rent and they will continue to do so.  The IDA has informed me that they have not increased any client rents since 2010.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.Action point 1.32 of the Action Plan for Jobs commits to the identification of any sheltered areas of the economy where competition is restricted and the commissioning of studies on such areas where appropriate.  In order to meet the Q 1 commitment  to identify sheltered areas of the economy where competition is restricted the Competition Authority undertook an exercise to identify any such sheltered areas.Having identified an initial range of areas of the economy that are likely to be sheltered in some way from competition, the Competition Authority applied its prioritisation principles to identify those that would potentially benefit the most from a market study.  The five prioritisation principles are: Significance of the issue or effect of the conduct in question; Impact of the Competition Authority's action; Wider economic significance of the market involved; Strategic significance and Risks, resources and costs.A detailed explanation of each of these prioritisation principles and how they are applied is outlined in the Competition Authority's Prioritisation Principles booklet which can be found on its website at http://www.tca.ie/images/uploaded/documents/Prioritisation%20booklet.pdf .The Authority is now engaged in a detailed scoping exercise to enable an informed decision to be taken on which sheltered area will be subjected to an in-depth study.

The European Progress Microfinance Facility is a European Investment Fund (EIF) initiative to support entrepreneurship and employment through microfinance activities. It was established by the EU Commission in 2010.  Initial engagement has already taken place between Social Finance Foundation and the EIF in relation to the EU Progress Microfinance Guarantee Facility.  Formal application will be made for the EU Progress Microfinance Guarantee Facility on establishment of the Micro-finance Fund. A rigorous due diligence process is required to secure EIF accreditation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 to 294, inclusive, together.There are 132 Community Enterprise Centres that have been completed or approved for funding from Enterprise Ireland and their locations are listed in the following tabular statement.The number of businesses supported by each Community Enterprise Centre is a day-to-day operational matter for the centre concerned. However, I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that according to a Community Enterprise Centre survey conducted in November 2011, in which 95 centres responded out of 110 centres surveyed, there were 775 tenants in the 95 Community Enterprise Centres that responded to the survey.Clauses in rent agreements between the Community Enterprise Centres and their tenants are a matter for the parties concerned.  However, I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the survey of Community Enterprise Centres found that each respondent centre mentioned that they conduct a yearly review with tenants to examine rent rates and facility charges. These centres stated that they have reduced their rents, in some cases significantly, to compete with private sector market space since the downturn in the economy.Map Ref No.RegionBorderCountyLocation1CavanKilgarry2CavanKilleshandra3CavanCootehill4CavanBlacklion5CavanBailieborough6CavanCavan7CavanKingscourt8DonegalCarndonagh9DonegalDonegal town10DonegalConvoy11DonegalLetterkenny12DonegalBallyshannon13DonegalGlenties14DonegalMoville16DonegalTaughboyne17DonegalLifford18DonegalBallybofey and Stranorlar19LeitrimDrumshanbo20LeitrimCorry21LeitrimBallinamore/Ballyconnell22LeitrimCarrick-on-Shannon23LeitrimManorhamilton24LeitrimMohill25LeitrimDrumkerrin26LouthArdee27LouthDrogheda28LouthDundalk29LouthGreenore30MonaghanBallybay31MonaghanCastleblayney32MonaghanEmyvale33MonaghanMonaghan34MonaghanCarrickmacross35SligoCollooney36SligoSligo37SligoEaskey38SligoBallymoteDublin39DublinCoolock40DublinDarndale41DublinLiberty42DublinNth Kings Street43DublinOxmantown44DublinSteppingstone45DublinBallymun46DublinBolton St47DublinBalbriggan48DublinBlanchardstown49DublinTallaght (Bolbrook)50DublinTallaght (Brookfield)51DublinAvonbeg52DublinNeilstown53DublinKillinarden54DublinBawnogue55DublinClondalkin56DublinDún Laoghaire-Rathdown (Nutgrove)57DublinFingal58DublinTerenureMid East59KildareAllenwood60KildareAthy61KildareClane62MeathKells63MeathNavan64MeathTrim65WicklowArklow66WicklowWicklowMidlands67LaoisPortarlington68LaoisMountmellick69LongfordLongford70LongfordGranard71OffalyFerbane72OffalyEdenderry73OffalyKilcormac74WestmeathAthlone75WestmeathMullingarSth/Sth East76CarlowCarlow77CorkMacroom78CorkYoughal79CorkMitchelstown80CorkKnockgriffin (Middleton)81CorkBantry (Allihies)82KilkennyKilkenny83KilkennyPiltown84WaterfordDunhill85WaterfordLismore86WaterfordWaterford87WaterfordCappoquin88WaterfordPortlaw89WaterfordTallow90WaterfordDungarvan91WaterfordKilmacthomas92WexfordWexford93WexfordEnniscorthy94WexfordTagoat Yola95Tipperary SouthClonmel96Tipperary SouthTipperary97Tipperary SouthCarrick-on SuirWest98GalwayBallinasloe99GalwayTuam100GalwayClonberne101GalwayLetterfrack102GalwayGalway103GalwayDunmore104MayoKiltimagh105MayoBallyhaunis106MayoBrickins Logboy Tulrahan107MayoCastlebar108MayoClaremorris109MayoFoxford110MayoBallina111MayoKillala112MayoClaremorris113MayoCrossmolina114RoscommonBoyle115RoscommonCastlerea116RoscommonArigna117RoscommonBallaghaderreen118RoscommonRoscommonMid West119ClareEnnistymon120ClareKilkee121KerryKillarney122KerryFarranfore123KerryBallylongford124KerryKenmare125KerryKilgarvan126KerryRoughty Valley127KerryCaherciveen128LimerickLimerick129LimerickKantogher130LimerickKilmallock131LimerickMurroe132LimerickBruree133Tipperary NorthRearcross

In March, a working group comprising officials of my Department, Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland met to progress development of an approach and a programme to support industry-led clustering.  The group identified a number of sectors which have the potential to progress clustering, particularly in the form of collaborative industry-led networks which seek to identify mutual objectives and, which if tackled collaboratively, can have a positive impact on the capability of companies to grow and create employment, wherever they are located.The group also identified some of the key principles which a clustering programme should embody, taking account of best practice.  Early stage consultations with industry were undertaken during April.  It is intended that industry proposals for the establishment of collaborative networks to drive clustering will be invited during Quarter 2 2012, with an active roll-out of the programme taking place in the latter half of this year in line with the Action Plan for Jobs.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	476	In the context of regional and all-island economic development, and recognising the opportunity to pursue mutually beneficial cross border co-operation on aspects of economic policy and infrastructure/spatial planning, IDA Ireland cooperates on a number of initiatives with Invest Northern Ireland.  Both agencies also share a strategic focus on attracting companies from the targeted sectors of ICT, Financial Services and Clean technologies.One of the success stories of this co-operation between the two agencies is the jointly developed North West Business and Technology Zone (NWBTZ). The fundamental aim has been to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor, to develop compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, and to make the region more attractive for investment.  The initiative has provided the catalyst for Eircom, Bytel and BT to invest independently in the telecoms infrastructure between Letterkenny and Derry and has also led to the development of Project Kelvin, which is the first direct International Communications link of its kind into the North West of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland both have a highly educated workforce and IDA Ireland highlights this competitive advantage to perspective investors.  The skills pool available, both north and south of the Border, are presented to potential investors as a key competitive advantage of investing in the Border region on the island of Ireland.  Up to 15% of IDA supported companies in the Border region employ staff living in Northern Ireland, increasing employment and prosperity in areas of north of the Border.  A recent example of this is Paypal who chose to invest in Dundalk based on the pool of skilled staff it could recruit from the large catchment area incorporating both sides of the Border.  While IDA does seek to influence location, the final decision as to where to locate is taken by the investor.

The Government is keen to ensure that SMEs have access to procurement opportunities and the Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures designed to improve SME access to those opportunities.  These include:ensuring that pre-qualification criteria (e.g. turnover, insurance thresholds, experience) for public procurement contracts are proportionate,the assignment by Enterprise Ireland of advisors and mentors to help client companies prepare better for public procurement opportunities, andencouraging more SMEs to register on the Government's eTenders website to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention.The impact of these actions will be measured over time.The number of companies currently registered on the eTenders website stands at over 72,000.  Approximately 90% of these are SMEs.  I understand that the National Procurement Service is currently evaluating tenders for an upgraded eTenders website, which will include a facility to generate reports giving details of contracts awarded.  Ultimately, however, the award of a contract to any particular company is a matter for the procuring authority in question, having regard to the content of the tenders received and the criteria under which they are assessed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 304 together.The Programme for Government states that: "The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people through education, community and voluntary structures."  To progress this commitment, the Action Plan for Jobs (Action 6.7) includes an undertaking to conduct a report on the potential of social enterprises to create jobs.  I have asked Forfás to carry out this work on my behalf.The project scoping work and initial research has been carried out and has involved discussions with a number of relevant parties, including Scottish Enterprise, Meitheal Mid-West, the Cooperative Development Society, and Dunhill Rural Enterprises Ltd.  Further consultation will take place with a wider range of stakeholders.  The report will identify the actions required by Government and other relevant bodies and agencies to support job creation in the sector.  It will examine mechanisms to capture the demonstration effect of locally driven initiatives already in place to nurture new enterprise and employment, as well as identifying ways to promote and develop social enterprise initiatives.  The report will also briefly discuss how social enterprises can contribute to wider policy objectives.  I have asked Forfás to complete their work and to report to me by the end of the year.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Ptolemy is the bespoke administration system of the Irish Patents Office, which facilitates the administration and maintenance of all Patent, Trademark and Industrial Design applications applied for in, or designating Ireland.  This encompasses both Irish (national) applications and those filed in the European Patents Office (EPO), OHIM (Community Trademarks) and WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation — International Trademarks and Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications).  It supports all aspects of the creation and maintenance of the electronic registers for Patents, Trademarks and Designs including payments and renewals, maintaining customer details, assignments, etc.There are currently (as at 31 December 2011) 88,044 Patents, 89,624 Trademarks and 1,652 Designs registered and in force in the State, all of which are managed and maintained by the Ptolemy system. The Ptolemy system also manages the receipt and processing an average of 65,000 individual fee payments per annum. The Ptolemy system supports various on-line services which are of considerable benefit to its customers via the Patents Office website.  These include the facility to pay certain fees on-line, to view and search the Patents, Trademarks and Designs registers and database, view and search Patent specifications and to view and search the fortnightly produced Patents Office Journal. Delivery of these services is in line with best international practice.  Versions of the Ptolemy system are installed in a number of Patent and Trademark administrations worldwide, including Norway, Sweden, Cyprus, South Africa and New Zealand.The Patents Office Ptolemy computer system was originally developed in stages over the period 1998 to 2002.  The total cost of this initial development was €1.914 million.  Since 2002 the system has continued to be developed and maintained to meet changes, including changes in legislation, the adoption of new international agreements in intellectual property protection, and changes in the supported software platforms on which Ptolemy runs.  The system has also been upgraded by the inclusion of new functionality to increase the efficiency of the Patents Office and to deliver improved customer service.  The cost of on-going support and development in the ten years since the system was fully commissioned in 2002 averages €456,600 per annum, which is broken down between new functionality development at €147,200 per annum and on-going support and maintenance at €309,400 per annum.The use of information and communications technology has delivered considerable efficiencies for the Patents Office.  The 2010 Annual Report of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks notes a staff complement in the Office of 46 full time equivalents, which is less than half the staff complement ten years previously.  This staff reduction represents a very significant and on-going reduction in the cost of service delivery, while the quality of service has been greatly enhanced through the application of new technology e.g. online payments, free access to registers and database searching, and electronic publication of the Patents Office Journal.While these systems continue to deliver considerable value through enhanced processing efficiencies and improved customer service, in order to assure my Department that the on-going support and development of the Patents Office systems are delivered in the most effective manner, an external independent review of this support was commissioned in late 2011.  The result of this review is expected very shortly, and will provide guidance on the further enhancement and development of the system.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The role of Government is to not to create jobs, but to provide the environment where successful businesses can become established, grow and generate jobs.  In addition to taking the policy decisions to underpin a competitive environment for business, the Government provides a range of supports to enterprise across a number of Departments and agencies.  Funding for these supports is allocated in the annual Estimates of the relevant Departments.From my own Department's perspective, enterprise supports are provided by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), Shannon Development, and InterTradeIreland.  The total allocation to these agencies in 2012 is €460.39 million.  In 2011, there were over 300,000 people employed in companies supported by these enterprise development agencies.  More than 28,000 of these jobs were created in 2011.The Action Plan for Jobs contains 270 measures for delivery across all Government Departments and 36 agencies which will support job creation this year.  So far this year, the creation of almost 3,400 jobs has been announced in respect of companies wishing to invest, or expand an existing operation, in Ireland.  In addition, my Department secured an increase in its capital budget for 2012 despite severe budgetary constraints. Between 2012 and 2013 almost €1 billion has been committed for capital supports for enterprise.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Following previous representations in December 2011, I had already requested the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to intervene on my behalf in this matter and seek enforcement of the €50,000 award.  In this instance, prior to NERA's involvement, the case had already been brought before the Circuit Court and a Court Order was issued by the Dublin Circuit Court dated 4 May 2011. An Execution Order dated 7 June 2011 contains a certificate from the Sheriff of the City of Dublin dated 11 July 2011 indicating he was unable to enforce the judgement as the business named on the execution order had ceased trading.Following NERA's intervention, the company's solicitor wrote to NERA stating that the company "is no longer trading and ceased any trading operations in or about September 2010. The only remaining assets in the Company are secured by a debenture in favour of its bankers."  NERA has established that a petition to wind up the company was made to the High Court last November. In the circumstances outlined, unfortunately, it is unlikely that the award made can be enforced.  It is my intention this Autumn, in the context of the forthcoming Workplace Relations Bill, to consider how a new and more effective method of enforcing these awards can be developed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	484	My Department currently has 13 State Agencies supporting us in our work.  These are:1. Enterprise Ireland2. IDA Ireland3. Science Foundation Ireland4. Shannon Development5. County and City Enterprise Boards (35)6. National Standards Authority of Ireland7. InterTradeIreland (the North / South Business Development Body)8. Forfás9. National Consumer Agency10. The Competition Authority11. Irish Auditing and Accounting Standards Authority12. Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and13. The Health and Safety AuthorityThe Public Sector Reform Plan published in November 2011 outlines a timeline for completion of a critical review of all of the State agencies and bodies across Government in the context either of merger, amalgamation or abolition.  A number of agencies within my Department's remit are included in the Plan and I can provide the Deputy with an update of progress in relation to the agencies of my Department in this context.In the context of Regulatory Agencies and Statutory bodies, my Department is working to effect the merger of the National Consumer Agency (NCA) and the Competition Authority.  The role of the NCA is to enforce consumer law, promote better understanding of consumer rights and advocate on consumer issues, while the Competition Authority is the State body responsible for enforcing Irish and European Competition Law in Ireland. Government approved in July 2011 the draft Heads of a Bill to allow for the merging of functions as well as well as other changes to consumer and competition law and this is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting.  It is anticipated that in effecting the merger, initial set-up costs will be incurred and minimal savings are expected to result from the merging of functions.As regards the Enterprise development agencies under my Department, a number of developments are in progress.  Forfás   is the national policy advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation and I have considered how the policy and research functions of this Agency can be integrated with my Department's resources to further enhance the formulation and development of national enterprise policy.  A proposal in this regard has been developed and will be discussed with the Board of Forfás in the coming weeks. Following this engagement, an Implementation Group will be convened.  Such an amalgamation will improve efficiencies/synergies between the Department and Forfás, but will not lead to immediate financial savings.As agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs)   support micro-enterprises (employing up to 10 people) in the start-up and expansion phases and also promote economic activity and entrepreneurship in their areas.  Government has recently approved the establishment of a new "one-stop-shop" micro-enterprise support structure through the dissolution of the existing CEBs and the formation of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). Meetings of the Implementation Steering Group will now be convened to facilitate detailed discussions with all relevant parties to ensure the final nature of any restructuring addresses the range of issues arising both from an organisational and policy perspective.  In conjunction with this development, my Department is seeking formal advice from the Office of the Attorney General regarding appropriate legislation.  Any potential for savings will be determined in line with the final nature of the restructuring.The Deputy may also wish to note developments with regard to Shannon Development.  Since December last, my Department has been in discussion with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and with Shannon Development,   the regional development company dedicated to promoting and developing the Shannon Region of Ireland, with a view to formulating proposals for the future enterprise role of Shannon Development. A Memorandum for Government is being prepared which will address both this issue and that relating to the tourism functions of Shannon Development. Savings will arise due to the streamlining of Shannon Development's activities and the elimination of duplication of work by public bodies and will be determined in line with the final nature of any restructuring.Separate to the Public Sector Reform Plan, there is underway in my Department a significant reform project relation to the Employment Rights and Industrial Relations bodies within my Department's remit.  I have announced my intention to streamline the work of five bodies currently dealing with employment disputes in the workplace into a two tier structure.  Four of the existing bodies — the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) and the Labour Court (LC)   — are currently within my Department's remit and one — the Equality Tribunal — is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I expect this reform and streamlining project to deliver a measurable improvement in the quality of services provided to users of the State's employment rights/industrial relations dispute resolution services and to reduce the cost of accessing such services for both users and to the State.  I have appointed a dedicated Project Team to drive this reform initiative and announced an ambitious timeline for delivery. A number of important reforms have already been delivered to date on this project including:A new single contact portal called "Workplace Relations Customer Services" is fully operational since the beginning of this year and provides a single point of entry into the system for employment rights and industrial relations information.  It has dealt with over 3,500 complaints in the first quarter of 2012 and has assisted in eliminating the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings.A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints was launched on the 4th of January this year, which replaced the 30 forms previously in use. Over 70% of all complainants in March 2012 used the new form.The new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie went live on the 4th of January this year. This website brings together, in one place, information on all aspects of employment rights and industrial relations.Delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.  The pilot will be evaluated and the outcome of the evaluation will inform the design of the mainstream service to be provided by the Workplace Relations Commission in the future.In parallel, work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new structure proposed.The total annual cost of the State's Workplace Relations Services amounted to some €20m in 2010.  It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by the end of 2013 by which time the majority of the Workplace Relations Reform Programme will have been implemented.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	485	In March of this year, An Taoiseach Enda Kenny and I led a seven day trade and investment mission to China.  The Mission I led incorporated a seven day programme covering Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Beijing.  Some 130 Executives from 90 companies accompanied the delegation.  During the Mission itself, An Taoiseach and I witnessed significant contract signings from 14 companies totalling more than €35m at business events organised by Enterprise Ireland. All together, these business events were attended by more than 900 Irish company representatives and their Chinese customers and partners and the contracts signed covered a wide range of sectors including: clean technologies, mobile software, international services, healthcare, consumer products, education and industrial technologies.In addition to these signings, a number of significant Memorandums of Understanding were signed between Irish companies and their Chinese counterparts.   These are essential building blocks in developing business in China. These covered areas such as International Education, Financial and International Services. It is expected that these signings will also contribute significantly to future export growth for Irish companies. In addition, Enterprise Ireland signed an MOU with their Chinese counterparts (CCPIT), which will see enhanced cooperation and a focus on working closer together on sectors of mutual interest.Over the course of the trade and investment mission, IDA Ireland met with 16 companies and financial institutions. China is a key strategic focus for securing new sources of Foreign Direct Investment to Ireland over the medium to long term. There are, however, some short term investments to be won and IDA expects to secure a number of investments over the coming months.  IDA Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China's ICBC Financial Leasing, a global leader in aircraft leasing and part of ICBC, the world's largest bank. This means that IDA Ireland is now partnered in China with ICBC, which has an unrivalled client base and network.  The key focus for IDA will be to build on the momentum generated by the Mission and to capitalise on the increasing awareness of Ireland as both a trading partner and a potential location for FDI to Ireland.China is central to Ireland's Asian trade strategy.  Significant opportunities for Irish business exist in areas like ICT and life-sciences as well as the tourism, farming and food sectors.  Contacts made during the mission with education, banking and legal sectors open the prospect of valuable new channels of training and other services exports.  The Trade Mission in March was a very important step in growing closer ties and contacts with our Chinese counterparts and that is given physical form with the agreement of both countries to enter in to a strategic partnership for mutually beneficial co-operation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21597	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	486	In December 2011, the European Commission launched a "Youth Opportunities Initiative" in response to the growing problem of youth unemployment across the EU.  The initiative calls on Member States to work on preventing early school leaving, help young people to develop skills relevant to the labour market, ensure the provision of work experience and on-the-job training, and help young people find a first good job.  The Government is responding to the issue of youth unemployment through the measures outlined its labour market initiative, Pathways to Work, which includes various training, education and work experience measures delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection   is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers and self-referred clients, although the long-term unemployed will be a priority target.In addition to the training and education opportunities outlined in Pathways to Work, many young people will benefit from the employment opportunities that will arise from the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  The objective of the Action Plan is to create an extra 100,000 net new jobs between 2012 and 2016, with the longer-term objective of having two million people at work by 2020.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Pensions are a long-term investment aimed at ensuring that people have an adequate income in retirement.  Government policy supports this aspiration through generous tax reliefs and we are currently reforming the pension system to ensure its future sustainability.  At the moment, people are generally only permitted to access their pension savings at the retirement age defined in their pension schemes.  Schemes may also have early retirement provisions from age 50 and when retirement is caused by ill-health, benefits may be paid regardless of age.  In the case of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs), benefits may be taken at any time after age 60 and from any age in the case of ill-health.There are a number of reasons why early withdrawals of pension savings are generally not permitted, nor desirable, the principal one being that funds, and the associated tax relief on contributions, are designed to support people in later life to ensure they have an adequate income.  This requires that pensions must be long term vehicles based on the principle that savings will be "locked away" until retirement.Allowing access to pension savings before retirement or pension age would be a significant change to pension policy and the basis of pension savings in Ireland.   At the request of the Economic Management Council (EMC) the issue has been considered in detail by an inter-departmental ad-hoc group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection.  The group concluded that the principle of pension savings being "locked away" until pension age should be maintained and reported this to the EMC.   The Interdepartmental Group on Mortgage Arrears also examined the issue of early access to pensions and did not recommend such an approach.The idea of allowing people to access their pension savings early to pay off mortgage debt or to increase their spending power may seem attractive, particularly at the moment.   However, the resulting reduction in pension savings could have significant negative consequences longer term and in particular, fails to address the group who may be most affected by personal debt or mortgage arrears.Younger people are unlikely to have significant pension savings and where their pension scheme has incurred losses, as many have over the past number of years, early withdrawal of funds would mean very poor value for money.  There is no guarantee the funds could be repaid or that people could make up these losses.   Where people are close to retirement, an early withdrawal of funds could significantly diminish the pension they receive as they may not have time before retirement age to fill the gap left by such a withdrawal.Only 51% of people in employment aged 20 to 69 have pension coverage.  This relatively low rate of pension coverage is a concern.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers and so a National Employment Pensions Scheme based on an automatic enrolment approach is being developed.  Allowing people access to their pension savings before pension age would run totally counter to the policy of encouraging more people to save more for their retirement.The Deputy will be aware that the Government has recently engaged the OECD to conduct an independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland.  The review will encompass the totality of pension provision in Ireland — State, private, occupational and public sector.  The issue of early access to pension savings will be considered in this context.

Under the current National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) system, all those who are unemployed and signing on are referred to the employment service when they reach three months singing on.  These NEAP clients are prioritised for assistance by the Employment Service. That assistance may include referral to FÁS training, but also help and advice on job search, referral to jobs or employment programmes, referral to assistance from other relevant public agencies, and assistance in accessing education opportunities.During 2011, over 100,000 people were referred to the (then FÁS) Employment Service under EAP, and some 80,000 people attended for interview. Data on outcomes are available for persons (some 81,900) who were referred for the first time during 2011. Outcomes were measured as at the end of January 2012, when it was found that 65% had left Live Register while 35% were still on it.65% left Live Register:64% (53,300) of the total referred to FÁS (81,900) had left the Live Register by the end of January 2012.15,900 (19% of the total referred) were placed in jobs, training or education and, of those, 4,700 (30%) were placed in jobs.24,600 were interviewed and then left the Live Register without further intervention (30% of the total referred).12,900 did not attend for interview but left the Register (16% of those referred).36% still on Live Register:36% (28,600) of the total referred to FÁS (81,900) were still on the Live Register at the end of January 2012.25,000 were interviewed but not placed in jobs/training/education (31% of  referred).2,800 did not attend for interview and are still on the Live Register (3% of those referred).400 were awaiting interview (1% of those referred).300 were active with the Local Employment Service.The former FÁS Employment Services are now being integrated into the new National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES). This will see the establishment of a single "one stop shop" public employment and benefits service with clear targets for rolling out a new approach which includes:better targeting of services through profiling those entering the live register,responsibility for delivering a more regular engagement with those on the Live Register at appropriate intervals, specifically targeting and tailoring the approach in so far as it is possible.  Interventions will include referral to group engagement, education and/or training and placement/work experience opportunities at appropriate intervals,provision of recruitment and job-matching services for employers and the unemployed,the provision of appropriate career guidance support as part of the engagement and referral system,effective communication and marketing of NEES services to employers,more meaningful engagement between the Department of Social Protection and employers both nationally and at a local level,improved service provision and monitoring of effectiveness through the roll out of a public services card, andthe implementation of sanctions against those who refuse to engage with the activation process.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The criteria for participating on the Community Employment (CE) programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying Irish social welfare payment, as defined on the Department's public website. This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994. Those persons not meeting the eligibility criteria under the Community Employment Part-time Integration or Part-time Job Options, or who are signing for credits, or receiving social welfare benefits from a different country, are not eligible to participate on Community Employment.The aim of CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education and training.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The CE programme is one of a range of training and employment programmes available for unemployed persons. All of these programmes have specific objectives and eligibility criteria that address the specific needs of a wide range of participants.Unemployed persons who are not in receipt of the required social welfare payments can still participate on many education and training programmes.  Such persons are advised to contact their local Employment Services Office where an Employment Services Officer will be happy to discuss the employment and training options that are open to them.  Within the current very difficult budgetary constraints, the number of places on Community Employment will remain at 23,300 in 2012.

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by this Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.The allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy, under the school meals local projects scheme, for the 2011/12 year is €38,304. This allocation is the same as that provided for the 2010/11 year when funding was allocated for the provision of a light lunch for 152 children.  As the budget allocation for the school meals programme has not increased in recent years, it is not possible at this time to adjust the level of funding provided to individual schools irrespective of a change in the school enrolment.  Applications for increased funding under the school meals local projects scheme are being retained on file by the Department and may be considered for additional funding at a future date, should such additional funding for the scheme become available.

Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that those on the  Live Register availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  Individuals who are in receipt of a widow's pension can access the Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months. During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.

The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The analysis of the rental market for Wicklow carried out by the Department found that rental prices for Bray were having a distorting effect on the prices for Wicklow as a whole.

This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.  Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes will take longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This will allow more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review.  The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply. Department Officers are supporting any schemes that have identified a requirement for on-going supports while the review is underway.

The aim of the review is to assess the schemes, individually and in combination, "in the light of their   contribution to the Department's policy objective of supporting people of working age into employment" and to "recommend any changes to the current range of schemes/programmes seen as required on the basis of the analysis carried out".The review is being carried out by an Assistant Principal Officer of the Department under the overall direction of a Principal Officer. An advanced draft of the review report was completed in March. It is currently subject to oversight from the Policy Committee of the Department, prior to being submitted to senior management for consideration.  As is normal for such reviews within the Department, its conclusions and recommendations will also be the subject of consultation with stakeholders of the range of programmes involved. It is envisaged that this consultation will take place in June.  A separate financial review of the Community Employment Scheme is also being carried out.

Cases are reviewed based on either the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed or on the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment. Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how their care requirements may change over time.DCA reviews are initiated with the parent/guardian being asked to complete a "review of medical criteria form", which also requires medical input from the child's GP.   The parent returns this form, together with any additional recent reports of ongoing medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  This information is then sent for review by one of the Department's medical assessors who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child still meets the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.The decision of the deciding officer is communicated to the customer in writing and they are given the option to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office.  Any new or additional information received after the issue of the revised decision and before the appeal is heard, is further assessed by another medical assessor.  In this way, the process affords parents/guardians every opportunity to provide additional information and to have this information assessed at an early stage with payment restored where necessary, in advance of an appeal hearing.Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis, taking account of all the evidence submitted.  Carer's Allowance is a social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits.  Where the person being cared for is under 16 years of age, one of the qualifying conditions for receipt of Carer's Allowance is that a Domiciliary Care Allowance must be in payment for the care recipient.I understand from the Social Welfare Appeals Office that statistics are not maintained on a county by county basis and it is not in a position, therefore, to supply the information sought by the Deputy in relation to counties Laois and Offaly.  For the first quarter of 2012, the average time taken to process DCA appeals decided by summary decision is 27.8 weeks and 43.4 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing. In the case of carer's allowance appeals, the corresponding figures are 29.6 weeks and 46.8 weeks. These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date on which it is finalised.

Qualification for the scheme is not based on the particular disability of the child but on the level of additional care required.  Autistic Spectrum Disorder is treated in the same manner as any other disability when processing an application for DCA.The Department took over responsibility for the scheme in April 2009.  As there were no agreed national medical guidelines for the scheme while it was administered in the Health Service Executive, an Expert Medical Group was established in advance of the transfer. This Group was chaired by the Department's Chief Medical Advisor and comprised of senior medical personnel from the HSE, as well as eminent professionals in the areas of physical disabilities which affect children, and child psychiatry/psychology. The primary purpose of this Group was to agree a set of consistent and objective guidelines for use nationally in determining eligibility of children for the scheme. The report of the Group was reviewed independently by external medical experts.The Group considered that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by assessing evidence submitted by the claimant rather than by way of individual examination by the Department's Medical Assessors, as they are not involved in advice or treatment of the child and the diagnosis of the child's condition by their GP is not in dispute.The process in operation in the Department involves the submission of a detailed statement by the parent or guardian of the child; a detailed statement by the child's General Practitioner; and any other relevant evidence from qualified experts who have examined the child. This evidence is assessed by designated Departmental Medical Assessors who provide an opinion to the deciding officer as to whether the child meets the medical criteria for the payment.In assessing the medical evidence and written reports, the Medical Assessor is required to make a determination as to whether the information contained in the application demonstrates that the child requires substantial continuous additional care and attention.  In this regard, the medical evidence and supporting documentation are key to assisting the Medical Assessor to determine if the child meets the scheme qualifying criteria.It is open to any person who is not satisfied with the decision in their case to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Any new or additional information received after the issue of the decision and before the appeal is heard, is further assessed by another medical assessor.  In this way, the process affords applicants every opportunity to provide additional information and to have this information assessed and the decision revised, if warranted, at an early stage in advance of an appeal hearing.

In addition, the office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department but it does not have a Board.  No statutory body under the aegis of the Department has been merged or abolished since 2011.The report on Public Service Reform proposes the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  These proposed rationalisations are the subject of a critical review under the Public Service Reform Programme. This review will include identifying any potential savings arising from such an amalgamation.  I have recently commissioned the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as an independent expert to review Ireland's pension arrangements.  This review has commenced and I expect that the OECD will also comment on the governance structures in the pensions sector.

The objective is to ensure that Ireland’s greatest resource, its people, will no longer remain on the Live Register for lengthy periods without an appropriate offer of assistance from the State.  To achieve this objective the Government has committed itself to a range of ambitious targets. Two of the most important commitments are:My Department will engage with each person who becomes unemployed in the future with a view to reducing the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months today to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.In addition working with the Department of Education and Skills we will provide in excess of 542,000 places on job placement/work experience and training and education in 2012.These are significant commitments at a time of reduced resources and reflect the importance placed by this Government on labour market activation measures. However, I am conscious of the particular problems relating to youth unemployment and the need to secure cross departmental involvement in the development of appropriate policy responses.  Pathways  facilitate such cross departmental co-operation and the effectiveness of the measures announced are being monitored on a quarterly basis.I note that my colleague Deputy Lyons has indicated that he will be asking the Jobs, Social Protection and Education Committee to give consideration to the development of a youth guarantee proposal.  I look forward to reviewing the proposals of the Committee when they are to hand.

Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.Individuals who are in receipt of a one parent family payment however can access the Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months. During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of certain benefits forms part of this broader review process. This review process is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that I may be in a position to present formal proposals very shortly.

I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay on 20th   February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an initial opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved.  The report of that seminar will be published in the near future and will provide the basis for more detailed consultations with key stakeholders, including other relevant Government Departments such as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, over the coming months.Before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme, a range of complex issues need to be examined in detail.   The cost/benefit analysis of the scheme will be contingent on how these issues are addressed and how the scheme would ultimately be structured.  The analysis of the potential impacts will be developed and refined as the consultations with key stakeholders progress.

The card will provide public service providers with verification of an individual's identity thus reducing the resources currently required to do so each time a member of the public tries to access a public service while at the same time making it harder for people to use false identities.PSCs are issued following a robust registration process and incorporate identification features including a photograph and an electronic signature.  The Department has been piloting the registration processes and ICT systems at three of its offices. This exercise started in July in Tullamore and was subsequently extended to Dublin (Kings Inn) and Sligo. The PSC issue facility was put into production at the beginning of October.  Nearly 7,000 PSCs have been issued to date.  These cards are available to be used by many public service bodies including the Department of Social Protection.  For instance the cards issued can be used to collect social welfare payments at post offices.In addition to establishing that the processes work in practice and that the supporting ICT systems work correctly, the pilot also aimed to establish the resources needed to deploy registration in Local Offices countrywide. Sanction for additional resources to support this has been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and these are currently being sourced and deployed. The pilot has also indicated the need for legislative changes to support the new processes and these have been proposed in the current Social Welfare Bill.  The Department is now finalising plans for a national roll-out of the new cards on a phased basis commencing in May of this year.

Changes have been made to the payment since its introduction in 1991, reflecting the changes taking place in society, the labour market and the expectations and realities of parents' lives, and particularly of mothers, in terms of work and care.  These reforms continue that change.  They recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children, while, at the same time, having an expectation that parents will not remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to participate in education and training, to develop their skills, and to enter or move in the labour market and, ultimately, to achieve financial independence.The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2012, introduces changes to the structure of the payment and the age of the youngest child at which the payment ceases.  These changes are being brought in over time.  I have acknowledged that reforming the OFP will require a whole of Government response.  I am engaging with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills to have a co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to ensuring that the required level of services is in place to support lone parents as their youngest child reaches the relevant age thresholds.At the same time, the development of the National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) and the profiling of jobseekers, which is already underway in my Department, will lead to a better identification and understanding of the supports that individual customers need and the extent to which these are available and affordable. As part of this cross-departmental approach, discussions have already been taking place between officials from my Department and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with regard to the development of a policy framework around after-school care, and, in the short-term, the assessment of the extent of the current provision of such care, the costs of such care to parents, and the demand for such services from lone parents.

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 95,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.The Deputy is correct to state that the Department's officials administering rent supplement are required to notify the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) section of cases where rent supplement is awarded above the relevant maximum limit appropriate to the case under review.  However, statistics are not readily available on the exact number of cases where rent supplement was paid in excess of the maximum rent limit.

It is estimated that saving of the order of €5.9m will be achieved in 2012 as a result of the measure.  In line with other Budget measures, this measure will not impact on any person whose sole income is from social welfare.The detail referenced from briefing on the measure was provided as a point of information reflecting the view of some employers.  In that context, the briefing went on to state that the effect of the measure would be to reduce the contribution from jobseeker's benefit to the weekly amount of total income and help towards a reduction in the reliance on the welfare system among those who currently avail of a mix of welfare and earned income.The 2006 Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to Workers who are not Employed on a Full-Time Basis, found that the scheme definition of a period of interruption of employment, whereby a person must be fully unemployed for at least three days in any period of six consecutive days, may have a disincentive effect. This effect may occur where a part-time worker is discouraged from taking up work for more than three days per week. Consistent with this finding it may be noted that some 40% of the casual and part-time jobseeker's benefit customers who avail of a mix of welfare and earned income, claim benefit in respect of three days and work for three days each week.The measure may act to reduce disincentives to higher levels of employment for this group. However, no estimate of the number who will move to full-time work as a result of this measure has been produced.

From 3 May 2012, new customers will receive the one parent family payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 12, from January 2013, age 10 and from January 2014, age 7. For existing customers there will be a tapered phasing out period to 2015 to enable them to access education and training and prepare them for their return to the labour market.The average weekly recipients, both new and existing, affected by these changes over the period 2012 to 2015 are 170 (2012), 765 (2013), 2,210 (2014) and 4,510 (2015).  When the youngest child of a lone parent reaches the age of 7, if the parent is still in need of income support, they can apply for the jobseeker's allowance (JA) which is paid at the same basic rate as OFP, and which has the same increases for each additional qualified child, and receive the activation supports attached to that payment.They will then be profiled and their individual needs will be assessed. This will facilitate the agreement of a progression plan with those customers, the development of their case management to assist them to either improve on existing skills or learn new ones, and their gradual move towards or entry into the labour force.  It is not known how many customers will take up employment as a result of the activation measures introduced in 2012.  Other than the impact figures provided above, no additional analysis of the specific age changes to OFP is currently available.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  Among the issues that the Advisory Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.Self-employed individuals may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.

One condition is that  a participant must have a minimum of a 156 week period on the Live Register, Community Employment, other recognised training interventions such FÁS training, or a combination of all these.  Of these 156 weeks, 52 weeks must have been continuously spent on the Live Register prior to start in order to qualify for CE in the first place.

As the Deputy will be aware, many actions being undertaken by Government in respect of supporting employment range across a number of Departments and Agencies.In respect of actions undertaken by the Government, a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, were introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May 2011.  In February 2012, the Government published a comprehensive ‘Action Plan for Jobs' and identified a range of specific actions to drive job creation under a range of headings. These actions are spread across numerous Departments and Agencies encompassing a whole of Government approach to protecting and creating jobs.As part of these processes, the Department of Social Protection offers a number of supports which encompass people under 25 years of age.  The Employer (Job) PRSI Incentive scheme was launched in 2010 and has now been simplified and extended as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.  Under the scheme, if an employer takes on an additional member of staff in 2012, who has been unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 6 months or more, they will be exempt from paying employers' PRSI for 18 months.  The job must be new and additional, be for at least 30 hours a week and last for at least six months.  The exemption is available for new and additional employees up to 5% of employers existing workforce or, for smaller companies, a maximum of 5 new jobs.I launched the National Internship Scheme, JobBridge in 2011 to  provide work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  The aim of the national internship scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Additionally, Tús — the community work placement initiative became operation in mid 2011 and provides part-time work opportunities for those aged 18 and over.At the end of 2011, the European Commission adopted a new "Youth Opportunities Initiative" which called on Member State to work on preventing early school leaving; helping young people develop skills relevant to the labour market; ensuring work experience and on-the-job training and helping young people find a good first job.  The Commission urged Member States to make better use of the European Social Fund and put forward a range of actions for Member States to consider.  The Government actions fully support the Commission's initiative.

The Programme for Government 2011-2016   states that the Government will support the Strategy and will deliver the achievable goals proposed therein.  The Strategy itself recognises the need for a phased approach to achieve its various measures. During 2011, my Department undertook the establishment phase of the Strategy during which the organisational structures were established, as set out in my Department’s implementation plan for the Strategy for 2011. The following organisational structures have been established to deliver the Strategy:The Cabinet Committee on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, chaired by An Taoiseach, is maintaining oversight of progress on the Strategy.A Senior Officials Group, consisting of high-level officials from relevant Departments, is supporting the Cabinet Committee.An Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by myself, as Minister of State, is coordinating the implementation of the Strategy.The Strategy Unit in my Department is responsible for directing the planning and implementation of the Strategy.In addition, the following high-level working groups have been established with key stakeholders to progress the implementation of various areas of action in the Strategy:A working group between my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to identify priorities regarding the implementation of the Strategy in education, taking current resource constraints into consideration.A working group between my Department, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge to distinguish between the individual functions to be carried out by these public bodies under the Strategy in a way that will ensure the best value for money for the Exchequer and the avoidance of duplication of provision.A working group between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding enterprise investment in the Gaeltacht.Following policy decisions taken by Government on 31 May 2011 with regard to the implementation structures for the Strategy and the new definition for the Gaeltacht, my Department is currently giving priority to the drafting of the Gaeltacht Bill 2012, which will give effect, as appropriate, to the Government's decisions.I should also mention that I announced two major initiatives under the Strategy on 26 April 2012. Firstly, I announced the launch of the language planning process in the Gaeltacht, under which a language plan will be prepared at community level for each Gaeltacht area, in accordance with the Strategy.  Secondly, I announced a Family Language Support Programme, which aims to strengthen the Irish language as the household and community language in the Gaeltacht, in accordance with the Strategy. Under this programme, my Department intends to undertake 12 specific measures to support Gaeltacht families who are raising their children through Irish or who wish to raise their children through Irish. More detailed information on the implementation of the Strategy is available on my Department's website, www.ahg.gov.ie.

As the Deputy is aware, the Government announced a series of rationalisation measures in the Public Service Reform Plan on 17 November 2011.  A number of amalgamations, mergers and critical reviews of bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group are currently being progressed, as required under the Reform Plan. Details of these are reflected in the Plan, which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform —www.per.gov.ie . 
As the Deputy will be aware, the priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State agencies provide that rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible at this stage to outline projected savings for each State body to be rationalised.  However, the implications from this decision are currently being examined within my Department with a view to identifying savings, as well as opportunities for efficiencies and more effective service delivery.

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector. In the context of the 2013 Estimates, I will, of course, be endeavouring to maximise continuing Government support for the arts.As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions.  The allocation to the Arts Council for 2012 is €63.241 million.  The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, that investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.In addition, my Department through Culture Ireland supports Irish arts worldwide by creating and supporting opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues, presenting outstanding Irish creative work to international audiences through showcases at key global arts events including the Edinburgh Festivals and Venice Biennales, as well as through special initiatives such as the recently concluded Imagine Ireland initiative in the United States.As the Deputy is aware, I wrote to him on 25 April 2012 setting out details of all arts bodies and/or groups that received funding since 1 June 2011, the amount of the funding provided and the purpose of the funding.  I also supplied details of all funding provided by Culture Ireland to organisations from June 2011 to date.  In addition, I forwarded details received from the Arts Council of all funding provided by it to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues in 2011 and 2012.In relation to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, there are 11 specific actions to be undertaken by my Department and the agencies under its remit in the areas of arts, culture and creative enterprise.  Together, I believe that we can work to realise the explicit and implicit targets set for these areas.  The relevant actions (under section 7 of the Plan) are set out as follows.7.14.1Take actions as set out in the Creative Capital Report prepared by the Audiovisual Strategic Review Steering Group to double the value of the film and audiovisual sector by 2016 to over €1 billion, double employment to over 10,000 and increase cultural exports of Irish audiovisual productionSteps Necessary for DeliveryTimelineResponsible bodyWork with the audiovisual industry to grow exportsOngoing 2012Irish Film BoardUndertake a range of skills initiatives to address medium to long-term challenges for the sectorOngoing 2012Irish Film BoardLeverage investment in data centres and cloud computing to create distribution and fulfilment opportunities for the digital content industries.Ongoing 2012Irish Film Board7.14.2Through Culture Ireland, maximise the business opportunities abroad for cultural and artistic businesses and enterprises by promoting Irish artists world-wide and showcasing our strengths in culture and creativityOngoing 2012DAHG / IDA7.14.3Through Culture Ireland, undertake joint marketing activities with the enterprise development agencies to build ‘brand Ireland’ in this sectorOngoing 2012DAHG / Enterprise agencies7.14.4Leverage the potential for language and roots tourism, working with Tourism Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland, Foras na Gaeilge and relevant partnersOngoing 2012DAHG / Tourism Ireland, National Archives of Ireland / Foras na Gaeilge and relevant partners7.14.5Roll-out further cultural digitization initiatives, in partnership with the private sector, in order the leverage our unique cultural offerings and bring them to a wider international audienceOngoing 2012DAHG7.14.6Through the Arts Council, support over 50 venues, approximately 200 festivals and 400 arts organisations in 2012, supporting employment in communities across the country, both directly through funding artists and organisations and indirectly in the tourism sector and the wider economyOngoing 2012DAHG7.14.7Ensure continuity in the provision of heritage services nationally through an allocation of €48m for 2012Ongoing 2012DAHG7.14.8Invest in quality customer offerings through the National Cultural Institutions and regional cultural bodies and enterprises to enhance our overall tourism offering and to make Ireland a destination of cultural distinction for the cultural tourists globallyOngoing 2012DAHG7.14.9Support research activities of relevance to the sector including research in the areas of digital networks, communications and radio spectrum optimisation, semantic web and sensor web, big data and data analytics, and their application in sectors such as film and television, social media and publishingOngoing 2012Research funders and Prioritisation Action Group

My Department also provides some limited funding for the built heritage directly or through the OPW. €2,005,000 has been provided in this year's Estimates for built heritage capital. My Department also provides funding to the Heritage Council which in turn supports many heritage projects throughout the country.  My Department is providing a total of €4,811,000 of Exchequer Funding for the Heritage Council in 2012 together with €1,500,000 from the Department's share of the Environment Fund.  Final allocations for future years have not been decided.The management and delivery of specific conservation projects is generally carried out through bodies such as the OPW, local authorities and heritage organisations that receive grants awarded by the Heritage Council.  This does not include private investment in conservation projects.  Information in relation to the total number of endangered heritage sites, buildings and excavations suitable for conservation and restoration projects is not available to my Department.In relation to protected structures, section 59 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of such structures.  On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served nationwide in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010, figures for 2011 will be available shortly.In 2011 my Department set up an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders to review the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This review includes an examination of how the legislation is operating in practice regarding the protection and management of architectural heritage from a central and local government perspective and the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to consider alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.In the context of the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015, the Department is developing various policy actions which contribute to the protection and appropriate re-use of our built heritage and aims to deal with on-going strategic objectives indirectly effecting our architectural heritage such as climate change, adaptive re-use for historic properties and a forward plan-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities.The scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State's built heritage is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.

However, I understand that the Arts Council, through its various funding schemes has provided support to projects in this area.  Further details are available on the Council's website at www.artscouncil.ie. My Department, together with the Department of Education and Skills, has also provided support to NAPD (National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals) for the Creative Engagement Programme which focuses on providing quality arts participation in second level schools.  My Department is continuing its engagement with the Department of Education and Skills to finalise a Charter for Arts in Education and I hope to agree this with the Minister for Education and Skills in early course.

In response to that question a letter issued to the Deputy dated 25th April 2012 containing the large amount of information sought.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has supplied details to him of all bodies and/or groups that received funding since 1st June 2011, the amount of the funding provided and the purpose of the funding.

As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for funding for the arts rests with the Arts Council, which is statutorily independent in this regard.  Notwithstanding this, my Department does receive applications for support and assistance and, to date this year, some 300 applications have been received from various groups involved in the performance of the arts throughout the country.  Unfortunately, my Department is not in a position to offer financial support in these cases, which are referred on to the Arts Council.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ), which is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain the national network system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.  The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.Having full regard to CER's network connections policy, Bord Gáis Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy.  The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER.  The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, when appraised on an individual basis or as a group, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.  The report can be accessed at www.gaslink.ie.Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.The recent decision to establish Irish Water within the BGÉ Group reflects the Government's confidence in BGÉ.  BGÉ's experience and management expertise in key areas such as raising finance, operating and investing in critical network infrastructure and delivering excellent customer service, can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the scope for any operational synergies over time between the respective operation, maintenance and development of the gas networks and the water networks by the two entities with the Bord Gáis Group.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	587	RTÉ has built, owns and controls the Saorview TV network and is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of that network.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides that the development of the RTÉ network is an operational matter for RTÉ and therefore not one in which I, as Minister, have a function.  That said, I have made enquiries of Saorview and can now provide the following information.  Section 130 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 Act provides that RTÉ must roll out a national digital TV network to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, I understand from RTÉ that their analogue network covers 98% of the population and the Saorview network will also provide 98% population coverage.Work has been ongoing across the country to prepare the transmission sites for the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television.  However, it is virtually impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means. Reasons for this include local topography, for example.  RTÉ is conscious of the needs of communities and is making efforts to ensure areas with larger population centres are provided with the Saorview service.  To date, RTÉ has committed to improve coverage in the following areas: Glenties, Bandon, Carlingford and Dingle.  Coverage improvements in these areas will not be possible until the analogue TV service is switched off.In addition to Saorview, RTÉ has developed Saorsat, a new free-to-air satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RTÉ television services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  Saorsat launched last month — in March 2012.  Currently, Saorsat provides access to the RTÉ channels including the new RTÉ channels developed for SAORVIEW.  TG4 is expected to be available shortly.  TV3 has not yet made a decision.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide this satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  I am informed that with this satellite service, Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population for the first time.I have been further informed by RTENL that certain areas serviced by transposers, self-help community systems and repeater stations are not being replaced or upgraded by RTENL.  To receive SAORVIEW, homes that currently use these systems will need to readjust their aerials to point to a Saorview transmission site.  In a small number of cases some homes may need to use the Saorsat satellite service.The cost of upgrading to either SAORVIEW or SAORSAT is the once-off cost associated with upgrading TV equipment to digital, for affected cases.  SAORVIEW or SAORSAT is free to use for everyone with the correct TV equipment.  A SAORSAT installation, including the cost of installing a satellite dish and set top box currently costs €300-€350.  A full SAORVIEW installation costs about €200 (for set top box and adjustment or replacement of aerial).  As with SAORVIEW equipment costs, it is expected that the cost of SAORSAT equipment will reduce as we approach the 24 October analogue switch off date.Should the Deputy have further questions about specific areas, I am happy to pass them on to RTÉ on his behalf.  Information on coverage is available from the dedicated Saorview website www.saorview.ie.  Information on Saorsat is available on www.rtenl.ie.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Ireland's telecommunications market has been open to competition since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Despite the current economic difficulties, significant private sector investment continues to be made in the provision of broadband products and services.The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  Between these private and public investments, at least a basic broadband service is now available right throughout the country including to SMEs.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie.The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  It will also be a key enabler for SMEs who wish to engage with cloud computing, or to expand their business by transacting online.  Generally, high speed services are available for larger businesses.  However, access and cost can sometimes be a challenge.The rate of internet adoption by SMEs continues to be a cause of concern.  While Irish consumers have shown a significant enthusiasm for purchasing online, figures suggest that much of this expenditure is going abroad as indigenous firms appear to be slow to embrace the opportunities presented by online marketing and sales.  Encouraging and facilitating Irish SMEs to adopt digital in their day-to-day business will be a strong focus of both the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce Report, which will be published tomorrow and the forthcoming National Digital Strategy for which a completion date is the target by year-end.

ESB have advised that during the downward salmon migration to sea (March-early June), the ESB operate a salmon smolt generation protocol involving evening and early night-time generation on their Kaplan sets (the most fish-friendly type of turbine).  These turbine sets are run at near to maximum efficiency and smolt losses are minimised.  The effectiveness of these running regimes has been shown to result in survival rates of between 88-92% for these stations.  The ESB operated salmon hatcheries that further mitigate the small scale losses.Smaller hydroelectric schemes such as Leixlip, operate differently as water is selectively discharged over spillway gates or through fish passes to prevent smolt losses.  On relatively small hydroelectric plants Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) have advised that there is also a requirement to fit fine mesh screens to the intake point during the spring migration period to prevent smolts being taken into and through the turbine.  As an additional safeguard, provision is also made for spilling water over a weir so as to provide an alternative downstream route.As regards the issue of sea lice from marine salmon farms, IFI advise that an important scientific study conducted by IFI on the impact of sea lice infestation of outwardly migrating salmon smolts from a number of rivers on Ireland's West Coast was published earlier this year.  This scientific study, conducted over a 3 year period, concluded that sea lice — induced mortality can be significant and that sea-lice larvae emanating from farmed salmon may influence individual survivorship and population conservation status of wild salmon in the river systems examined.As part of the development of fish farming, the protocols for the control of sea-lice infestation at salmon farms is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in which I have no role.  I am fully supportive of sustainable aquaculture development and I strongly support the ongoing efforts of the Minister, his Department and the agencies operating under its aegis to ensure that all such activity complies with our obligations under the Habitats Directive and other EU legislation designed to protect our environment.These measures are necessary to ensure that protection is afforded to declining native wild salmon stocks and to the valuable angling tourism sector valued at €100 million per annum by Fáilte Ireland and IFI that supports jobs in our coastal and rural communities.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	592	Responsibility for the regulation of premium rate phone numbers, and advertising of these, including those referred to in the Deputies question, is a matter for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The BAI and ComReg are independent statutory bodies and as such I as Minister have no role in this matter.  The enactment of the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act, 2010 transferred the responsibility for the regulation of premium rate services (PRS) in the State from the Regulator of Premium Rate Telecommunications Services Limited (RegTel) to ComReg.In relation to the regulation of premium rate services, ComReg, as the competent authority in this jurisdiction, has a Code of Practice in place.  The Code derives from the original RegTel Code and has been operated by ComReg since July 2010, pending the further development of a Code in this area.  Service Providers of premium rate telecommunications services are required to comply with the provisions of the Code of Practice.There are a number of specific provisions in this Code of Practice which are pertinent to the advertisement of premium rate chat services.  Chatline services of the type that the Deputy refers to are not defined as Sexual Entertainment Services, but rather as Virtual Chat Services.  However, the Code of Practice addresses Services of a Sexual Nature, in section 8.4 of the Code and consequently the Code includes provisions governing the promotion of such services.  The Code also administers, under Section 5.2, and in particular, Section 5.2.3 of the Code that service providers must ensure that services are not used in any way to promote or facilitate prostitution.  Compliance with this code is a matter for ComReg.The BAI has responsibility for certain types of advertising rules.  Section 8(9) of the BAI's General Commercial Communications Code (GCCC) makes general provisions for premium rate telecommunications services and requires that commercial communications for such services comply with Irish and European legislation and with the rules, regulations and Codes of Practice issued from time to time.  The GCCC also makes a more general provision in relation to matters of offence, harm and dignity, and a range of rules under section 3.2 of the Code deal with these issues.  For information also, ComReg inform me that a new Code of Practice will come into force on the 5 June 2012, and will update the rules around these types of services.

Bord Gáis Energy operates as a competitive, dual-fuel, all-island energy business, with some 470,000 gas customers and over 400,000 electricity customers.  Bord Gáis Energy sells gas and electricity in all market segments; with related activities including call centre management, billing, sales and marketing.  Through its Home Services Team, it offers customers a wide range of products and services to help increase their overall energy efficiency.  Bord Gáis Energy also owns and operates a significant portfolio of wind energy assets as well as the 445MW gas-fired power plant in Whitegate.In Northern Ireland, Bord Gáis Energy has 149 MW of wind development projects.  Through its Firmus subsidiary, it offers competitive electricity and gas supplies to Northern Ireland consumers, including the distribution and supply of gas in its franchise area of ten towns in Northern Ireland.Bord Gáis Energy is a dynamic and successful company which has delivered real benefits for consumers as it has invested and grown in power generation and energy supply.  The Government has reiterated its commitment to retaining BGÉ's gas networks and interconnectors in State ownership as strategic infrastructure which is fundamental to Ireland's security of energy supply and the economy.Following the Government's decision on State asset disposals, a group including my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA has been tasked with progressing all policy, regulatory, legislative and financial issues to be addressed prior to the disposal of Bord Gáis Energy.  The work will be ongoing over the coming months.  The timing of recruitment of any external advisors for the process has not yet been decided.

These Regulations transpose the Nitrates Directive and are the basis of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme.  The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, through, inter alia, the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.The Nitrates Regulations were reviewed in 2010 and, amongst the wide range of submissions considered by an independently chaired Expert Advisory Group established by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Marine, were a number seeking increased flexibility with regard to the arrangements for the closed periods for the spreading of organic fertilisers.  The Expert Advisory Group, however, did not propose a change to the dates set out in the Regulations.  The selection of the closed periods in the Nitrates Regulations was informed by meteorological data over a 30 year period.  Conditions for the spreading of slurry have generally been good this spring.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	596	On 15 December 2011, I published the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill.   In developing this Bill I have had particular regard to recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report, published in March 2011.  The Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and is currently before the Dáil at second stage.  It will, when enacted, fundamentally change the way politics is funded and conducted in Ireland.  The Bill provides that political parties will be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.  This provision will address the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation that all income of political parties be disclosed.  It will go beyond this recommendation by providing that the expenditure of parties is also reported and open to public scrutiny.The Tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be disclosed.  The Bill provides that the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission will fall from €5,078.95 to €1,500.  The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or elected representative is to be reduced from €634.87 to €600.  There is provision for a reduction from €5,078.95 to €200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns.  In addition the Bill provides for a reduction in the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies, in reporting donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission, from a figure of €5,078.95 to €1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.The Moriarty Tribunal Report noted that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Oireachtas, and for public debate and consideration, having regard to constitutional issues that might arise and to the national financial exigencies.  With reference to this comment in the Tribunal Report, a noteworthy provision in the Bill is the introduction of a ban on the acceptance of donations over €200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Government's objective is to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  Such donations will also need to be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body, or by its trustees.As a further reforming measure, the Bill provides that the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual is being reduced from €2,539.48 to €1,000.  This €1,000 limit will apply in respect of donations to a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, as well as a candidate at a Presidential, Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament or local election.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party is being reduced to €2,500.  The current figure is €6,348.69.  This Bill will significantly enhance the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland, issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I propose to take Questions Nos. 441, 444 to 447, inclusive, 463, 468 and 488 together.The Programme for Government  provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Government has decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Éireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme. In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water which will also be responsible for repair and maintenance of the meters.It is intended that the installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies will commence later this year and that installation contracts will be awarded by Irish Water to private contractors. The nature of the work will involve minor excavation and reinstatement works and will provide much needed employment in the construction sector. The types of jobs involved could include general operatives, plumbers, fitters, supervisors, contract managers and accounts and administration staff.  The recruitment of staff to carry out installation works and ensuring that they have the skills to carry out the necessary works will be the responsibility of the private contractors. The procurement strategy for the metering programme will be finalised with Irish Water and no contracts have yet been awarded. Tender processes will be managed in accordance with national and EU procurement rules. The technology used will be a matter for public procurement by Irish Water and technology will be a specific criterion for the procurement of the meters.In keeping with international practice regarding water metering, the meters will be installed at the boundary of the property, most typically in the footpath at the front of a house. All necessary health and safety measures will be considered in the installation phase. As is the case with other utility services which are supplied on a metered basis, households will be able to access their water meter and therefore will be in a position to monitor their water usage. They will also be able to query such meter reads with a dedicated customer service centre and customers will receive bills several times a year, as is the case with other utility services.It is not possible to indicate the number of households that may be subject to an assessed charge at the time water charges will commence as this will depend on progress with the metering programme and the date on which charges are introduced. The approach to be taken for the setting of charges will be determined as part of the regulatory process.

Written submissions to the Group were invited from interested organisations and members of the public before 16 March, 2012.  A total of 112 submissions have been received.  In addition, the Group has held meetings with interested parties.The terms of reference of the Group are:To consider the design of a property tax for approval by Government to replace the household charge that is equitable and informed by previous work and international experience.The property tax is to:meet the immediate financial requirements of the EU/IMF programme;provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector in the medium and longer terms; incorporating an appropriate element of local authority responsibility subject to any national parameters;be collected centrally by the most cost efficient and effective means;facilitate easy and/or phased payments by households;be easily determined (e.g. on a self assessment basis), and having regard to the information currently available (or to be made available through registrations for the household charge) on residential property and/or house ownership details;ensure the maximum degree of fairness between and across both urban and rural areas.The Group is also to consider the appropriate arrangements for:a robust audit function; andstrong enforcement and penalty provisions for non-compliance.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.  Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.I have asked local authorities to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoption of their 2012 budgets.  From the adopted Budgets for 2012 submitted to my Department by the 88 rating local authorities, 68 authorities have maintained their ARVs at 2011 levels and 19 local authorities have reduced their ARVs.  One local authority has increased its ARV and will continue to increase it until 2015, but this is a technical adjustment and legal requirement following the extension of a town boundary. Overall, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.  I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under consideration in my Department.

Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, as amended, and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, the Central Bank may authorise inspectors for the purpose of ensuring compliance by financial services providers with the provisions of this legislation. I did not authorise the PwC inspections under the Dormant Accounts legislation and my Department had no role in regard to the reports. The Central Bank was, in the circumstances, acting on its own authority and not, as suggested, acting as an agent of the Dormant Accounts Board.The advice provided by the Central Bank is that it is not permitted to disclose confidential information concerning the banks that it supervises; I must respect the independence of the bank in such matters. Under the Dormant Accounts legislation, where, following an inspection, there is reason to believe that an institution is in breach of any provision of the legislation or there is a material defect in the systems, procedures and practices referred to in section 22 (1) (c) of the 2001 Act, the inspector must prepare a report, in writing, and submit a copy to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.  Queries in respect of specific elements of estates as listed in the Statutory Instrument should be addressed to the relevant local authority.

Application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Both Acts contain common provisions dealing with the situation where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property dies.  The legislation provides that the personal representative of the deceased person is not, in respect of that residential property, liable to pay the household charge or the charge on non-principal private residences relating to a year in which the liability falls after the date of death of the deceased person and before the date of issue of a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person.  The specific provisions are contained in section 4(3) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and, in relation to the charge on non-principal private residences, in section 4(7) of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended.In addition, both Acts provide that where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property dies and, at the date of his or her death, a household charge or a charge on non-principal private residence (and any related late payment penalties) remains unpaid in relation to that property, no  further late payment penalties are payable in relation to that property until a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person issues to the personal representative of such deceased person.The personal representative of such deceased person is, as soon as a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person issues to him or her, liable to pay to the relevant local authority the full amount due and owing by the deceased, at the date of his or her death, in respect of the household charge or the charge on non-principal private residences and any related late payment penalties.  Where the full amount owing is paid by the personal representative within 3 months of the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased, he or she shall has no further liability. Where the full amount owing is not paid by the personal representative within 3 months of the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased, he or she is liable to pay late payment penalties, in addition to the full amount, from the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased.These provisions are contained in section 7(3)-7(6) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and section 6(3)-6(6) of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended.

The Government recently approved for publication proposed legislation, the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012, which will be a key facilitator in the Department's agency rationalisation programme.The Bill will allow my Department to dissolve the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Local Government Management Services Board and An Chomhairle Leabharlanna. In their place a single agency — The Local Government Management Agency — will provide the shared services in industrial relations, ICT, procurement and library services for all 34 local authorities.  The dissolution of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna could provide a once-off windfall to the State through the disposal of their headquarter buildings.The two Limerick Regeneration Agencies will be dissolved with roles to be replaced through the development of the joint management arrangement for Limerick City and Limerick County Council as a step to the merger of the two Councils.The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) has been established and is operating on an administrative basis. It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR). The AHP and the CHR have been closed down and the NBA ceased operating in June 2011. The NBA headquarters was sold in March 2012 for €2.84 million.Comhar (Sustainable Development Council) was discontinued at the end of 2011 and its sustainable development role has been integrated into the work of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC).The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2011 proposes to amend existing dormant accounts legislation so as to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board and transfer the statutory functions of the Board to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Bill was published on 5 September, 2011. It has passed all stages in the Seanad and is currently at Second Stage (resumed) in the Dáil.Initial savings in the order of €1.9 million have been achieved in the agency rationalisation process and I anticipate that this should rise significantly.

It requires initial type testing before an aggregate is placed on the market, and these tests to be repeated if the aggregate comes from a new source, if there is a major change in raw materials or when the aggregate is to conform to a new requirement.Standard Recommendation (SR) 21, published by the National Standards Authority (NSAI) in 2004, provides guidance on the use of I.S. EN 13242:2002.   It was revised in 2007 to give additional specific guidance on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in material fill for use under concrete floors in dwellings and buildings.  The revised standard includes a detailed sample specification which sets out the results expected of hardcore, when tested in accordance withI.S. EN 13242:2002.  The pyrite panel, which I set up in September 2011, is due to report to me shortly.  On receipt of its report, I will give consideration to any recommendations it may contain in relation to a requirement for a common testing standard for buildings affected by pyrite.

The Building Regulations set out the minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings, including houses and extensions.  Works carried out in accordance with the guidance in the TGDs is considered, prima facie, evidence of compliance with the Building Regulations. However, an approach other than that set out in the guidance is not precluded, provided compliance with the relevant requirements can be demonstrated.  I will give careful consideration to any recommendations which the report of the independent Pyrite Panel may contain in relation to standards for the remediation of buildings affected by pyrite.

My Department operates a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities, and any exceptions to the moratorium in local authorities require sanction from my Department.Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for City and County Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.  My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services, and economic issues are given precedence.The number of staff employed across all 34 local authorities at end of June 2008 was 37,243, compared to 28,765 at end of March 2012, a reduction of 8,478 whole time equivalent basis (WTE). The reduction of staff in local authorities is a net figure as given the nature of the front line services provided such as fire and emergency services, road and water services, beach supervision in summer months and other temporary seasonal services, some sanctions for exceptions to the moratorium need to be, and are, regularly approved.  In this regard my Department has processed some 3,448 such requests since 2009. The staffing reductions for each local authority for the period June 2008 to March 2012 are outlined in the table below on a WTE basis.My Department is working with local authorities to ensure that optimal numbers and critical posts are identified and that critical posts are filled.

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.   I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 30 April, 2012, a total of 737,946 property declarations have been processed by the household charge bureau. 722,610 registered for payment of the charge equating to some €72.5m. 15,336 residential property owners have registered for a waiver from payment of the charge.  In addition, 178,000 postal applications have been received in the household charge bureau, which have yet to be processed; these equate to a further €17.8m.  A further 15,500 declarations have been received by local authorities equating to some €1.5m. This gives a total number of 931,446 declarations made equating to €91.8m.  According to Census 2011, there are 1,649,408 households in permanent housing units in the State.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.  The exemptions from payment of the household charge are—Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concern—Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.There are an estimated 50,000 entitled to claim waivers from payment of the household charge; some 18,000 in respect of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement and 32,000 in the context of unfinished housing estates.

This permission is currently valid until 11 June, 2013.  I understand that the person concerned entered the State on the same date as her mother. Given that she is currently over 16 years of age, in line with current legislation, I would advise that she, through her parents, contact her local Garda Immigration Officer as soon as possible in order to regularise her status in the State by means of formally registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In the unlikely event that she encounter any difficulties in this regard, I would advise that she should write to the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 2, to seek such permission.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy about the importance of tackling cyberbullying. I am pleased to say my Department is playing an active role in the effort to defeat the phenomenon but I recognise that it is a difficult issue to address effectively. That however, will not deter us in our efforts to counteract it and to assist children, their parents and teachers in dealing with it and in recovering from it.  I will outline several of the initiatives and projects currently in place to assist those who are confronted with the problem, but at the outset, I want to stress that anyone having difficulties with internet content should, in the first instance, direct their remarks or complaint to the service provider.As regards measures in place, I want to begin with the Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU because it is so important to have full engagement by service providers. The Principles were adopted on a voluntary basis in 2009 by the major social networking website operators based on an initiative from the EU Commission. They provide good practice recommendations for social networking providers to enhance the safety of children and young people using these services. In particular, they provide that social networking services should provide a mechanism for reporting inappropriate content, respond to notifications of illegal or inappropriate content or conduct and should review their systems for examining and responding to such reports. The EU Commission monitors the implementation of the Principles on an ongoing basis.Turning now to more specific initiatives, I want to outline the variety of activities supported by the Safer Internet Ireland (SII) project. It is funded by the EU's Safer Internet Programme and draws together the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), ISPCC Childline, the National Parents Council (Primary) and the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland in providing Safer Internet awareness, hotline and helpline functions. The project is coordinated by my Department's Office for Internet Safety (OIS).  Each of the partners in the SII project performs a specific function. The NCTE, an Agency of the Department of Education and Skills, manages the Webwise initiative (www.webwise.ie) which is the Irish Internet Safety Awareness Centre. Webwise provides parents, teachers and children with educational resources, advice and information about potential dangers on the internet and enables users to minimise or avoid these risks.The NCTE also operates the www.watchyourspace.ie website. It provides advice for young people on how to manage their online activities so as to avoid problems.  ISPCC’s Childline service receives funding from the project to support it in responding to young people who may have encountered difficulties in their use of the internet and other technologies, including cyberbullying.  The project also provides funding to the National Parents Council (Primary) for a national confidential helpline providing information and support for parents if their children encounter issues on the internet, particularly cyberbullying. The NPC also delivers internet safety workshops for parents in schools nationwide. These workshops focus on strategies for improving communication between parents and children and negotiating boundaries to children’s internet use.The annual Safer Internet Day has become an important occasion. It is part of a global drive to promote safer and more responsible use of online technology and mobile phones, especially amongst children and young people. The Day is supported by the EU and has been marked since 2004 in a growing number of countries. Safer Internet Day 2012 took place on Tuesday 7 February with the theme “Connecting generations and educating each other”. Users, young and old, were encouraged to “discover the digital world together...safely”!  The Webwise Primary School Programme was launched by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on Safer Internet Day 2012. This is a programme developed by Webwise and Stay Safe for primary school teachers who wish to introduce internet safety into their teaching of the Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum.The Garda Primary Schools Programme makes a very important contribution. Introduced in 1991, it teaches children sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour. To mark Safer Internet Day 2012, a new module of the Programme entitled "Respectful Online Communication" was launched.  It is targeted at 5th class children in primary schools and aims to address the social media element of the personal safety module of the Programme. It recognises the challenges that children and young people face in modern society, particularly when using new technologies. It aims not only to protect our children from predators or bullies but also to foster a sense of care and respect by them for others when online or when using mobile phones.  Gardaí are presenting the module in primary schools throughout the country.Finally, I want to recognise the contribution of almost 200 industry volunteers from Microsoft Ireland, UPC and O2 who, working with the NCTE's  Webwise, gave internet safety presentations to over 15,000 pupils in schools across the country for Safer Internet Day 2012. The interactive presentations were given to children in senior primary classes — in 4th, 5th and 6th class.  Pupils who attended Safer Internet Day Talk were given a Family eSafety Kit produced  by UPC and Webwise. The pack contains a variety of fun activities and stickers as well as a Parents' Guide.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with our partners in the SII project, the industry and our EU partners to protect and to enhance the projects and initiatives already underway and to develop new responses where possible.

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.

Local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents as a result of anti-social behaviour.  I am further informed that policing measures are in place to address such difficulties, including in areas that have been designated as hot spots for anti-social behaviour.  Local Garda management has directed that additional high visibility patrols of the area take place.  The local Community Policing Unit liaise closely with residents to address any issues of concern raised.  The locality is the subject of regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit and local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources. Incidents of public disorder and other anti-social behaviours are dealt with by way caution, fixed charge penalty notice or by the initiating of criminal proceedings.  Local Garda management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service is being delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirements for the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service.  I am further informed that the situation is being kept under review by Garda management.

A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such prisoners have no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage.  Accordingly imposing multiple life sentences, whether concurrently or consecutively, do not increase the severity of the sanction and have no effect in practice or in law.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce legislation to facilitate courts making provision for structured settlements in circumstances where lump sums are currently awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another.  In the High Court Working Group Report on Periodic Payments to which the Deputy refers, it is recommended that legislation be enacted to empower the courts to make periodic payment orders as an alternative to lump sum awards to compensate injured persons in cases of catastrophic injury where long term permanent care will be required. The Working Group also recommended that periodic payment orders should only be made where the court is satisfied that continuity of payment under the periodic payments order is reasonably secure.The successful operation of a statutory scheme for periodic payments requires the establishment of a financial infrastructure to ensure that continuity of payment is secure. In this regard the Working Group recommended that the State, through the agency of the National Treasury Management Agency, be empowered to provide injured victims with the necessary security for periodic payments either by the provision of annuities to insurers and others or in such other manner as may be appropriate. Alternatively it was recommended that consideration be given to the introduction of a statutory scheme whereby payments made under periodic payment orders will be statutorily protected and guaranteed.With respect to security of payment, the NTMA is conducting an actuarial review to examine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of periodic payment orders as an alternative to lump sum payments, or other options. The review will examine in particular the feasibility of the State acting as an annuity provider to insurers and indemnity providers in personal injury actions to enable compliance with the security of payments principle. The outcome of the review will inform the development of proposals underway in my Department to meet the Government's commitment to legislate in this area. The review is expected to be completed in June 2012.

The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.

I can inform the Deputy that good progress continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It is never the intention that the person would remain long term in the State as a volunteer.  Merely returning home and then applying to re-enter would not appear to be in keeping with the spirit of this policy.  That is not to exclude the possibility that in very special circumstances a particular individual could apply to have their case considered as an exception but in the normal course the three-year limit must apply.The new policy for volunteers was introduced on 1 January 2011 and any person coming here after that date would be aware of the rules in advance.  Moreover since the earliest a person could exceed their three year allowance is 1 January 2014 there should be sufficient time for all the parties concerned to make their plans accordingly.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Questions 589, 597 and 605 on 24th April 2012.
I propose to take Questions Nos. 589, 597 and 605 together.

It is assumed that the Deputies are primarily interested in whether any staff of my Department, who benefited from either the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme in 2009 or the transitional arrangement that operated up to 29 February, 2012 which allowed public servants to retire on pensions calculated on the basis of the salary scales prior to the January 2010 pay reductions, have subsequently been re-employed by my Department. Accordingly the information set out below covers the period of both these Schemes. Information prior to 2009 is not readily available.

The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER), which was in place from 01 May 2009 to 23 October 2009, allowed public servants, who had not yet reached minimum retirement age, to retire without any actuarial reduction applied to their pension entitlements. A total of 51 staff in my Department availed of the ISER, none of whom were re-employed by my Department. Under the terms of the ISER persons who availed of the scheme are not eligible for re-employment by their former public service employer.

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided that the superannuation benefits of public servants, who retired within a “grace period” from 01 January 2010 to 29 February 2012, were unaffected by the pay reductions introduced for all public servants under that Act. A total of 116 staff in my Department retired within this “grace period”.  A number of these staff retired under the terms of the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme (CNER) while others had reached normal retirement age. None of these staff have been re-employed by my Department.

While none of the above staff were re-employed, it should be noted that on occasion, retired public servants may be re-engaged by my Department on a short term basis because of their particular knowledge and expertise in a particular area, for example, to serve on interview boards.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	649	The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that cases in which a plaintiff seeks possession of lands and/or premises can be granted by the Circuit Court sitting locally or the High Court which has full jurisdiction.  The Courts Service has informed me that in 2011 there were 22 Orders for Possession of Property granted by Trim Circuit Court.  All of these orders related to residential property.  It is important to note that orders for possession do not necessarily equate with repossessions as it is up to the person or company who obtained the order for possession to pursue its execution.The Courts Service has further advised that the statistics maintained in relation to possession orders issued by the High Court are not maintained by reference to property type or by county and it would require a disproportionate amount of staff time which cannot be justified in current circumstances.  I am informed however that the High Court granted 281 possession orders in respect of the entire country during 2011.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	650	During 2011, the following State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality were abolished:The Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) was dissolved on 31 March 2011. This body was set up to monitor and report on paramilitary activity across Ireland and also to monitor the security normalisation measures undertaken by the British Government in Northern Ireland.The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IMCD) was dissolved on 31 March 2011. This body was responsible for overseeing the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons. It was established by an agreement between the Irish and British Governments, signed on 26 August 1997, and by legislation enacted in both jurisdictions.The Prisons Authority (Interim) Board was abolished as a result of a Government decision taken on 26 July 2011. This Board was established in 1998. In line with its policy to abolish agency boards, where appropriate, and make agency managers more directly accountable to Ministers, and on foot of its commitment to more effective financial scrutiny in the Programme for National Recovery, the Government saw no case for the continued existence of this Board.The radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011. This streamlining includes the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012, as well as the critical review of a further 46 bodies to take place by the end of June 2012. Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found at: http://reformplan.per.gov.ie/files/2012/01/Public-Service-Reform-28112011.pdf
While these rationalisations will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants. It is not possible at this time to specify anticipated savings on an individual State body basis. The Public Service Reform Plan indicated that across the public service as a whole, savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money are envisaged from the rationalisation programme.With regard to State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, the bodies which are to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished during 2012 are:Equality Tribunal (Rationalise the industrial relation / employee rights institutions — Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority, and  Equality Tribunal into single agency). The purpose of the Equality Tribunal is to deal with all complaints of discrimination in employment and access to goods and services under the terms of equality legislation.Equality Authority, Human Rights Commission (Merge to form new Human Rights and Equality Commission).  The purpose of the Equality Authority is to ensure that all people in the country are treated equally and to ensure that discrimination on certain grounds does not occur. The Authority provides information to the public on the equality legislation and it can, at its discretion, provide legal assistance to people who wish to bring claims of unlawful discrimination. The Irish Human Rights Commission works to promote and protect human rights in Ireland.The merger of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission will create a new and enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It will lead to strengthened institutional arrangements to protect and promote human rights and equality in the State. Last October, I established a Working Group to advise me on practical arrangements in that regard, including on matters relating to the legislation that will be necessary to effect the merger. The Working Group reported and its report was published on 20 April. I intend to bring my proposals for legislation in this matter to Government shortly. While there will be savings, estimated as being in the region of €500,000, on administrative costs due to the merger, regard has to be had to the disproportionate cuts suffered by these two bodies in previous years in deciding how such savings will be applied in 2013 and subsequent years.With regard to State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, the bodies which are subject to critical review in 2012 are:Property Services Regulatory Authority (Merge with the Private Residential Tenancies Board). The purpose of the Property Services Regulatory Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents.Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal (Rationalise various Refugee structures). The purpose of the Reception and Integration Agency is to accommodate asylum seekers in RIA accommodation centres while their applications for asylum are processed and to coordinate the provision of services to asylum seekers in RIA accommodation. The purpose of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is to investigate applications from persons seeking a declaration for refugee status and to issue appropriate recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality. The purpose of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is to decide appeals of those asylum seekers whose applications for refugee status has not been recommended by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.Property Registration Authority (Merge the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority). The purpose of the Property Registration Authority is to act as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland.Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (Amalgamate Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with the Office of the Ombudsman). The purpose of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is to protect the individual’s right to privacy by enabling people to know, and to exercise control over how their personal information is used, in accordance with the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2001.Prison Visiting Committees (Reduce or merge Visiting Committees as there is now a Prisons Inspectorate). A prison visiting committee is appointed to each prison and the committee’s function is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which it is appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests (Subsume Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests into proposed Office of the Charities Regulator). The purpose of the Commissioners is to provide a variety of services to charities of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature in accordance with legislation governing charities.Forensic Science Laboratory (Merge Forensic Science Laboratory into State Laboratory). The purpose of the Forensic Science Laboratory is to provide high quality scientific analysis and assistance to agencies involved in criminal investigation, mainly An Garda Síochána.

Each case is determined on its facts. As a general rule  however it is the case that an immigrant convicted of a serious criminal offence can expect that fact to have the most adverse consequences in any consideration of whether s/he will be allowed to remain in the State.

This programme is progressed by the Office of Public Works, who have responsibility for capital expenditure in respect of Garda accommodation, in close co-operation with the Garda authorities.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that they are currently involved in consultations with the Office of Public Works in relation to the upgrading of the station referred to by the Deputy.  In addition I have been informed that the requirements of the station will be fully considered in the context of An Garda Síochána's accommodation programme and in the light of available resources.

In that context I can confirm that my Department has received submissions from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association as well as from a small number of individual credit unions.  In addition, representatives from my Department and the Department of Finance met with credit union representatives in March to brief them on the proposed legislation.The submission from the group referred to by the Deputy has only just been received by my Department.  The submissions and other comments on the General Scheme of the Personal Insolvency Bill received from credit union representatives and other interested groups and individuals are being taken into consideration in the overall context of the further development of the legislative proposals.

I will contact the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	655	Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 31 March 2012, 3,222 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 2,076 to children. Fifteen good behaviour contracts were made in respect of a child.  In addition, four civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.  In setting up the regime in the Act the intention was that the different interventions would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It is only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order would be applied for.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The provision and allocation of Garda resources, including transport, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational requirements. I am advised by the Garda authorities that a procurement process for the supply of Garda vehicles is currently being finalised by the National Procurement Service with a view to putting in place a contract which will allow for the provision of additional Garda cars.  This is a matter which will be pursued in the light of An Garda Síochána's identified policing requirements and the availability of financial resources.In that overall context the Garda authorities have informed me that they are not in a position to indicate the stations to which additional vehicles will be made available during 2012.  However, they have also informed me that the allocation of Garda cars throughout the country will continue to be monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis in response to operational priorities.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	658	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided in October of last year to merge the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission to form a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC).  I established a Working Group to advise me on practical issues in relation to implementation, including powers and functions for the new body, other issues in relation to the necessary legislation and on the best location for the IHREC.  The Group has now reported and its Report was published on 20 April 2012.The Group recommends that the IHREC should have a single office in Dublin in a premises that is accessible to people travelling from outside the capital and to people with disabilities. The Group makes the point that the bulk of staff of the two existing bodies are based (in two separate premises) in Dublin. Dublin therefore is the most cost-effective location, as well as being the most accessible location for people in other regions.In relation to the Equality Authority's office in Roscrea, the Group concludes that operation of this office imposes an extra administrative cost and burden and that having staff of such a small organisation split between separate premises would undoubtedly make the task of integrating the two existing organisations more difficult. Having considered all the options carefully, and while being conscious of the contribution that staff in Roscrea have made to the Equality Authority, the Working Group recommends that the Roscrea office be closed. The Group acknowledges that there are complex HR issues that need to be managed proactively by management in the new Commission and by the Department over a period of time and that the appropriate transition arrangements should be in place to ensure that the interests of the Roscrea-based staff are protected in the transition.I am currently examining this and indeed all the recommendations made by the Working Group and will bring my proposals in relation to the various recommendations set out in the Report to Government shortly.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State.The key elements of the Bill include—enhancing inquiry and inquest processes,establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters;providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service;moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners;statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process;clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, andpromoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill this year.The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The decision on any sentence imposed in a criminal case is a matter for the courts, which are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their functions.  If a defendant wishes to appeal against a conviction or the severity of the sentence imposed, there are procedures in place for an appeal to be made to the appropriate court.  The Courts have made it clear that the Executive cannot operate a parallel or alternative system of justice by intervening in the sentences imposed by the courts.  There are however powers for the Executive to manage the sentences imposed by the courts.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I understand the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a pilot project, the Community Return scheme, in October, 2011 under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered earned early temporary release with supervised community service.  The pilot project was introduced in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group and is being overseen by a steering group comprising representatives of my Department, the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service.  The scheme is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years.  Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.  As of 30 April, 2012, a total of 161 prisoners have been released under the scheme.
As announced yesterday with the launch of its new three year strategic plan, the Irish Prison Service will begin the national roll out of the Community Return Programme in conjunction with the Probation Service.   Under this strategy, the Prison Service intends to increase the number of prisoners benefitting from this structured form of release over the course of the next three years by working towards the placement of 400 prisoners per annum serving sentences of one to eight years. It is envisaged that there would be no more than 150 prisoners participating in this scheme at any one time and all prisoners will be carefully assessed before being approved for the scheme.This is but one element of a comprehensive strategy which provides for a structured form of release leading to improved resettlement and reintegration opportunities for prisoners along with providing for work to the benefit of communities.  However, as I said yesterday  "In all things balance is critically important and I emphasise the fact that in all of this the most vital strategic target is the enhancement of public safety.  As a key element of the Criminal Justice System, the Irish Prison Service, along with An Garda Síochána and the Courts, has a critical role to play in this regard and it is vitally important that, when what some commentators have described as the inevitable tension between care and custody becomes an issue, we must never lose sight of the need to put public safety and the integrity of the Criminal Justice System to the forefront".
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 to 533, inclusive, together.The Personal Insolvency Bill is currently being drafted by my Department in cooperation with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel. This is a very lengthy and complex Bill from a legal standpoint, with proposed provisions which do not currently exist in Irish law. While it was hoped that the Bill would be published by 30 April, work on its development is still proceeding in the context of the many submissions received on the Bill which include, the report of the Joint Oireachtas Justice Committee received in early March following their completion of hearings on the Bill.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is important that the provisions of the Bill are legally robust.  This requires careful legal drafting of the text and full consideration of issues which emerge during the drafting process.The Troika team was in Dublin in the past fortnight and progress on the Bill was discussed with them. They are supportive of the provisions contained in the General Scheme of Bill which I published on 25 January last along with my colleague the Minister for Finance.  They appreciate the complexities involved in drafting a Bill of this nature and understand that some additional time is required to finalise the text in preparation for publication.  I expect that the Bill will be one of the matters for discussion with the Troika in the context of their next quarterly review in early July.I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June next with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the Dáil prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.

A further 29 recruits were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force up to 30 Jan 2012.  In addition, there was an intake of 32 Cadets from the 2011 Cadetship competition.  The Government has decided to accept my recommendation that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be maintained at 9,500.  I believe that this is the optimum level required to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.  As the Permanent Defence Force is currently below the agreed serving cadre there will be phased recruitment of General Service Recruits in 2012 within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  A recruitment competition was launched on Monday 2 April 2012, the closing date for which was 22 April 2012.   Along with General Service recruitment a limited number of Instrumentalists will be enlisted in 2012.  The 2012 Cadetship Competition was also advertised last week.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	665	I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 to 537, inclusive, together.As the Irish Red Cross Society is not a State Body, there is no requirement for Government to advertise publicly in advance of nominations being made by it to the Society's General Assembly.  Following its recent decision to amend the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939, the Government may nominate up to 10% of the membership of the General Assembly.  On the basis of the Society's current overall membership, which in turn dictates the size of its General Assembly, the maximum number of Government nominees is four.  I intend to propose four names for nomination by Government shortly.I am aware of the fact that it is the firm view of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that membership of the Society's Board of Directors is a matter for the Irish Red Cross itself.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to seek assurances on the future make-up of the Board but I am satisfied that appointments to a new Board of Directors will be made shortly in accordance with the Society's recently revised Constitution and Rules.  The Deputy may wish to note that there is no provision in the Constitution or Rules for the Minister for Defence to have five representatives on the Board.A further change made by the Government's recent decision to amend the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 is that the Society shall shortly appoint a Chairperson, in accordance with its own Constitution and Rules.  The process of appointing a Chairperson is therefore a matter for the Society itself.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	667	To date the information requested from the Deputy when he was Minister for Defence has not been provided.  I am informed by the Military Authorities that the compilation of the information provided to personnel who were prescribed Lariam is ongoing.  As soon as it is complete I will arrange to provide the information direct to the Deputy who requested it.   Lariam is a malaria chemo-prophylactic agent first authorised for use in 1989 by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines, to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines available in Ireland.  Research has shown that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in Drug Safety Newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the Irish Medicines Board remained of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remained acceptable. The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate. Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the Irish Medicines Board.

Approximately 10 acres comprises the main barrack area with the remaining 14 acres consisting of a camp field. There are a large number of buildings in the barracks which generally date from the early 19th century. The main building is a three story block which surrounds the main square and there are also a number of additional buildings on the remainder of the site. The majority of buildings were in use up to the time of the closure of the barracks. A small number of buildings are in a relatively poor condition and were not occupied in the recent past. As the barracks was a functioning entity up to the 30th March there are water, electricity and gas services on site.When the Government took the decision to close a number of Military Barracks, I asked officials from my Department to enter into discussions with other Government Departments, Local Authorities, State Agencies and community groups regarding the possible purchase of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures. In this regard officials from my Department have met with officials from the various agencies and discussions are ongoing.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to dispose of the barracks so as to maximise the benefits to the local community.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	669	The bodies under the aegis of my Department are the Army Pensions Board, the Civil Defence Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.  There are no plans to merge or abolish the Army Pensions Board.In July 2011, the Government approved a proposal to begin drafting legislation to transfer the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence. The Heads of the Civil Defence (Repeal) Bill were subsequently agreed by Government and the Bill is currently being drafted. If enacted, the Bill will repeal the Civil Defence Act, 2002, dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer its functions, property rights, liabilities and other responsibilities to the Department of Defence. Such changes will not have any impact on Civil Defence operations nationally and Civil Defence will continue to operate from Roscrea as a Branch of the Department. The transfer of the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence is expected to realise savings in running costs of approximately €60,000 per annum.Coiste an Asgard was the company set up to manage the National Sail Training Scheme. In September 2008, the company's sail training vessel ‘Asgard II' sank in the Bay of Biscay. In December 2009, the previous Government announced that the National Sail Training Scheme was to be discontinued and the funding for 2010 was cancelled. Up to and including 2009, the company had been receiving funding from the National Lottery of approximately €800,000 per annum.  The Company has been inactive since and there are no crew or staff left on the payroll. The winding-up process is well advanced and it is anticipated that the company will be in a position to close by the end of this year, following a final audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The People's Millennium Forests Project was a flagship Millennium project sponsored by the National Millennium Committee and AIB and managed by Coillte in association with Woodlands of Ireland.  The mission of the People's Millennium Forests Project was to ensure that all future generations can enjoy the benefits of Ireland's native forests.  There were 16 sites involved in this project, 14 of which are in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland. One element of the Project was the "Household Tree Scheme" whereby each household in Ireland had a native tree planted at one of the 13 sites of the 14 sites in the Republic of Ireland, with the 14th site exclusively for the protection of a unique native yew wood in Killarney.While a certificate was issued to each household in relation to the "Household Tree Scheme", it did not confer legal ownership of the tree to that household. The context in which the trees were planted is that they would be part of a woodland community that would remain in place in perpetuity.  People were invited to participate in the People's Millennium Forests Project by visiting the forests and to enjoy the ever-changing natural environment of native woodland with its associated flora and wildlife.I am aware that 12 of the 16 sites involved in the Peoples Millennium Forest Project form part of the Coillte forest estate.  As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.  The protection of the People's Millennium Forests is one of the issues to be considered in the decision-making process in relation to the possible sale of Coillte assets.

In addition, only certain Irish soils are suitable for this crop. While some outdoor growers have ceased tulip production in recent years others, that are operating under protective structures, continue and some are planning to expand their tulip production.  Cut flower and bulb production in Ireland represents a very small proportion of overall horticultural output and tulip production was always a small part of the cut flower and bulb production sector. For example, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine estimates for 2011 valued Irish cut flower and bulb production output at just under €2m, compared to an overall horticultural output farm gate value of €289m.

Sanction for this contract was received from the Minister for Finance and it is expected that the contract will be completed at the end of May 2012.  An Assistant Secretary General who retired under the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement in October 2010 was re-engaged by my Department on a part-time contract basis since.  Sanction for this contract was received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which expires in October 2012.In 2012, one Superintending Senior Research Officer, two Senior Research Officers, and one Superintending Veterinary Inspector were also re-engaged on a contract for services basis for a limited period.  In the period 2008 to date, 8 retired veterinary staff applied to the Department to be rostered for meat inspection, as and when required, on a contract for services basis.  In the same period, 3 retired laboratory staff were re-engaged for laboratory duties on a contract for services basis and these contracts have since terminated.  Normal pension abatement rules were applied in all these cases.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	679	It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, especially from an economic perspective, as it contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families.  While it has proven necessary to reduce the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme, the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria for 2012 have been designed to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.  In proposing the changes in question, the intention is to better focus the Scheme, which is to the benefit of the majority of those farming in areas with recognised constraints, while at the same time attempting to cater for those genuinely prevented from achieving the revised minimums.However, specific provision will be made under the 2012 Scheme for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  In addition, the principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming. A new entrant to farming is defined as someone who commenced farming in their own right and at their own risk at some point since 1 January 2010.

The draft has been published following an extensive review of the existing Rates and Charges Order for the Fishery Harbour Centres that came into effect in 2003.  The 21-day period for public consultations closed on Friday 20th April and a total of 85 submissions were made by stakeholders.The submissions received will now be examined closely by my Department and all submissions will be given full consideration before I finalise the new order.  My officials are willing to meet with interested parties to discuss the draft Rates and Charges Order, to provide any necessary clarification and to listen to and consider alternative suggestions to the individual charges included in the draft order.  It is only when I have reflected on all the matters raised in the consultation process that I will finalise a new Rates and Charges Order for the harbours.

A 21-day period for public consultations closed on Friday 20th   April and a total of 85 submissions were made by stakeholders.  The submissions received are being examined closely by my Department and all submissions will be given full consideration before the new Order is finalised.Representatives of the Dingle Boatmen have indeed made a formal submission in relation to the charges.  I am well aware of the valuable contribution that the harbour and its customers make to both the local and national economies.  The harbour delivers both for the Fishing Industry and the Tourist Industry and I am pleased to say that in 2011 my Department invested almost €700,000 at the harbour from its capital programme.  The valuable contribution made by the Dingle boatmen to the local tourist trade and in providing valuable employment is well known and acknowledged.  It is not my intention to levy charges for use of the harbour facilities at a level that will affect them disproportionately.  At the same time, it is my intention that the new rates and charges will spread the costs fairly and in a balanced way among all the harbour users.Given the variety of the boats in use and the various charges applicable it may be useful for the representatives of the boatmen to meet with my Department's officials with a view to getting clarity on the level of charges applicable and offering their suggestions.

REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue. During the course of an on farm inspection on 28th July 2011, areas which were in non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme were noted and a penalty was applied in relation to non-compliance associated with the Conservation/Management practices pertaining to archaeological monuments in the agri-environmental plan of the person named.An appeal against the decision to impose a penalty has been submitted by the person named.

As the Deputy will be aware, there was provision under the 2011 Scheme and previous years, whereby compliance with the minimum stocking density requirement was waived where the holdings of given applicants where constrained in the level of stock which could be maintained, due to compliance with the requirements of recognised Agri-Environmental measures.It is my intention that specific provision will be made under the 2012 Scheme for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.In addition, the principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming. A new entrant to farming is defined as someone who commenced farming in their own right and at their own risk at some point since 1 January 2010.

One of the conditions of the scheme is that in each of the five years the applicant must be in REPS at the time of application for the annual FEPS premium.  If their REPS membership ceases before the end of their 5-year FEPS term, this makes them ineligible for continued payment of FEPS premiums. Their standard Afforestation Scheme premium would continue for the period of their contract (20 years in the case of farmers).  The linkage of eligibility for FEPS is to the REPS Scheme and it was not extended to the new Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS).

It was the most ambitious trade delegation ever which my Department, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland brought together, with a total of 51 Irish companies and 127 individuals involved.  This was in addition to Government agencies such as Teagasc, BIM, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and leading universities involved in the provision of educational courses in food safety and agricultural science.The purpose of the visit was to facilitate the development of the kind of close political, official and commercial relationships that are intrinsic to doing business in China. The Trade Mission was, I believe, an excellent example of the practical collaborative action between government, industry, universities and research institutes that has helped to increase the profile of Ireland as a major producer of high quality food and a centre of excellence in terms of food safety, sustainable production systems, animal breeding and genetics.China is a key strategic trade partner for Ireland and has a strong demand for imports of quality food, given the size of its population and concerns over food security and safety. Ireland is strategically placed to be a key supplier of quality meats, dairy products, beverages, seafood and other products and services to China.  Already in 2011, Ireland has exported €240m of these products to China.From a political perspective there were also some very significant achievements, following from ongoing discussions with the Chinese side prior to my visit.  These included:1. Signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service on sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues, including the setting up of a working group on market access on beef.  Ireland is the first country in the EU to have set up such a working group with China and is only one of three countries in the world to date to have such a working group.2. Signing of a MOU with the Ministry of Agriculture on mutual cooperation in the agri-food and fisheries areas, building on the expressed wish of Chinese Vice President Xi that Ireland and China develop deeper cooperation in agriculture.3. Signing of a MOU between the Department and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service on the export of Horse feed to China. An Irish feed company, Connollys, is the first foreign company to be approved to export horse feed to China.4. Renewal of Bovine semen protocol.5. Signing of a MOU between the Marine Institute and Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences.Some very significant commercial outcomes were also achieved during the visit including:The announcement of a $50 million project involving an Irish company in a joint venture to partner China in establishing its national equine facility.The opening up of the Chinese market and the awarding of business to the first foreign company from Kilkenny for the export of horsefeed to China.The signing of agreements between BIM and eight Irish Seafood companies to supply China with commercial samples of boar fish to China.Signing of an Agreement between SAMCO and Pioneer on the supply of machinery for maize growing (Enterprise Ireland).The setting up of an Ireland-China Food Hub for Irish food and drink exporters, a shared Office facility, which will be managed by Bord Bia and which will target the Chinese market and provide practical solutions and support for Irish companies already in the Chinese market and those seeking to enter the market.I was also present at the signing of an agreement between UCD and United Dairies which envisages the development of a demonstration farm in China that would use equipment manufactured in Ireland and operated by Chinese staff, trained in Ireland.I was also particularly delighted to have taken part in the dedicated Sino/Irish Forum on ‘Building a Safe and Sustainable Future for Food' in the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences.  This forum served to highlight and build awareness in China amongst key officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chinese Administration of Quarantine Supervision and Inspection Services and well as key opinion informers and policy makers in China of the high level of official control measures applied to the production of Irish food products and the science underpinning the efficiency and sustainability of Irish food production.The invitation from the Nanjing Agriculture University to make a key note speech on Ireland's contribution to the future of sustainable agriculture in the context of the major global challenges of food security and climate change was also a key highlight for me of the Trade Mission.  Overall, I am very proud of the collaborative approach taken and of the very significant achievements arising from the Trade Mission.

Responsibility for these Regulations rests with my colleague, Minister Phil Hogan, Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.These Regulations transpose the EU Nitrates Directive into law in Ireland with the objective of these Regulations being the protection of ground and surface waters including drinking water sources, through the application of measures to reduce the risk of nutrient enrichment from Agriculture to water.  These Regulations require that where arable land is ploughed between the 1st July and the 30th November, the necessary measures shall be taken to provide for emergence, within 6 weeks of ploughing, of green cover from a sown crop. It further requires that where grassland is ploughed between the 1st July and 15th October, the necessary measures shall be taken to provide for emergence by 1st November of green cover from a sown crop.  In effect, these conditions require that land is not ploughed and left unsown at that time of the year when the risk of nutrient loss from the soil or directly as a result of soil being washed from land is at its greatest.Under Ireland's first Nitrates Action Programme which came into force in 2006, the first date for ploughing without the need for establishment of a subsequent crop was set at the 16th of January. This date was however revised to the 1st December following scientific work to evaluate the environmental consequences of revising the date and this revision facilitates the earlier ploughing of land in advance of spring sowing.  I understand from my colleague, Minister Hogan that the current Nitrates Action Programme runs until the end of 2013 and will be subject to review during 2013.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme. The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded under the programme. The programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Family Resource Centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.On 5th December 2011, the Government announced the funding levels being made available to my Department in 2012. As part of the national effort to address Ireland's fiscal deficit, the Family Support Agency, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make significant savings across all the programmes which it administers. The Agency is required to achieve savings of 5% per annum over 2012-2014 on the costs of the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The Family Support Agency has written to the family resources centres advising them of the reduction in funding and the need to plan for change. The Agency is acutely aware of the challenges that the reduction in funding raises for the family resource centres throughout the country. The Agency has not stipulated how centres should apply the reduction in funding.The family resource centres are asked to focus, in particular, on addressing the scope for greater efficiency and for reduction in the administration and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day running of the centres, with the objective of supporting as far as possible, the services that the centres provide to families and groups at local level.  The Family Support Agency has advised that family resource centres should work with the two regional support agencies that provide support and training to them and are available to provide guidance to assist centres to manage within the resources available.  In 2012 an allocation of €26.465m has been made available to the Family Support Agency to fund its services for families.  This includes funding of over €15m for the Family Resource Centre Programme.

Funding of some €56.806m for current expenditure and €1.5m for capital expenditure was allocated in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The distribution of the capital funding is under active consideration at present and a decision in relation to its distribution will be announced shortly.In light of the significant reduction in the overall current budget for the youth sector over the past few years, the emphasis has been, and will continue to be, on preserving front line youth services. In determining financial allocations to initiatives and schemes in 2012 officials from my Department have met with representatives of the youth sector on an ongoing basis with a view to determining how best to minimise the impact of the reduction on youth services.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people. I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and cohesion across departments and front line youth services.  This will ensure that the funding available in future years will be used as effectively as possible.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	703	The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  One of these schemes is the Youth Service Grant Scheme which provides support to national youth organisations.  The Deputy might wish to note that under this Scheme funding amounting to €1,645,457 in 2012 is provided to the Catholic Guides of Ireland, the Irish Girl Guides and Scouting Ireland Ltd. In addition, the organisation referred to by the Deputy has received funding under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.To support my Department's commitment to the development of quality, front-line youth projects and services which address the changing needs of young people and their communities, I have ensured that, as part of the Government's Capital Review published in November 2011, capital funding available for youth projects will increase to an annual amount of €1.5m in 2012. My Department is currently developing a strategy for the implementation and administration of this measure so as to ensure impact, resource effectiveness and value for money.  Information in relation to the distribution of this funding will issue in the near future to administering agencies such as the Vocational Education Committees.Subhead C.6 of Vote 43 for my Department also contains a funding resource allocation of €500,000 in 2012 to support community groups and organisations with an involvement in the provision of supports and services to children and young people under the application based National Lottery Funding Scheme. It will be open to the organisation to apply for funding from this source and details of the funding scheme, including the related application form, are available on my Department's website www.dcya.gov.ie.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I would like to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of public bodies under the auspices of my Department is that there are four agencies funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote. These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Ombudsman for Children.  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.  They are also funded through my Department's Vote.  I can inform the Deputy that none of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department have been abolished or merged since 2011.  There are plans to merge the back office function of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children's Office into the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner's Office and discussions are ongoing in this regard.There are also plans to merge the Family Support Agency into the new Child and Family Support Agency with a view to its establishment in 2013. The Family Support Agency was established under the Family Support Agency Act 2001 and transferred to my Department in 2011.  It is a dedicated Agency with clearly defined functions and responsibilities in the area of family services and policy.  In November 2011, the Family Mediation Service which was part of the Family Support Agency transferred to the Legal Aid Board which comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.The National Educational Welfare Board was established in 2002 under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 as the statutory agency with responsibility to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives a certain minimum education, and provides a service to most disadvantaged areas and the most at — risk children and young people.  I propose to review the role of the National Educational Welfare Board by the end of June 2012 in the context of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency and a working group has been established to progress this.There are currently no plans to rationalise or review the functions of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  It should be noted that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011 the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Amendment Act 2011.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 and 585 together.The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It sets out minimum standards regarding intercountry adoption and covers issues such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.A limited number of adoptions from Russia are currently being processed under transitional arrangements as provided for in the Adoption Act, 2010. Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2012, with the possibility of the Adoption Authority granting approval for an extension of up to one year. Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  In the circumstances, adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bi-lateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard. I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so shortly.The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.

These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.A delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption.  The AAI is currently preparing a report for me on its assessment of the situation which will inform the next steps to be taken.

The latest data available are in respect of March, 2012. These show that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies was 2,627. The number of individuals employed in social worker grades at end 2009, 2010 and 2011 was 2,418, 2,674 and 2,674 respectively.  It is important to note that these figures apply to all social workers employed by the HSE, and indeed by a range of other public and publicly funded bodies, to fulfil a range of roles, some of which fall outside the child welfare and protection services. For example, social workers are employed in hospitals to assist patients and families with the social aspects of their illness, in the mental health services, in primary care and in relation to older people.  It is also important to note that these figures represent the number of individuals employed and not the whole time equivalent figure, which provides a more accurate and meaningful representation of the quantum of services provided.The latest information from the HSE indicates that 31 social work staff availed of the early retirement scheme.  The HSE is actively reviewing the impact of recent retirements at national and regional level. The National Director of Children and Families Services, Gordon Jeyes, will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, having regard to identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.  The HSE has in place an agreed Service Plan for 2012 and this includes the recruitment of 10 additional social workers as part of the establishment of a multi-disciplinary team for children in care and detention.I am very much aware of the financial and service challenges facing the HSE in 2012. The challenges are such as to require acceleration of the reform programme across child and family services, leading to the establishment of a new and dedicated Children and Family Support Agency, to which the Government is fully committed.  The Government has made additional budgeting provision of €19m for child welfare and protection services compared to the funding made available last year.  This compares to a reduction of €14m which was made in the HSE's 2011 National Service Plan which was approved in December 2010. The additional funding made available for 2012 provides further impetus to the comprehensive reform of service delivery which is under way and which is aimed at generating the best possible outcomes for vulnerable children and families.My Department will be working very closely with the HSE throughout the year to ensure that the priorities set out in the HSE National Service Plan are implemented where they relate to children and family services.  We have set an ambitious programme of work, one which is designed to significantly strengthen the policy, legislative and practice framework.  Our shared goal is the delivery of appropriate, effective and consistent services, notwithstanding the very challenging and demanding circumstances in which these services are delivered.

The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made by the Madden Commission in 2008 and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.  Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.  Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.  It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised by year end.  In the meantime I am making arrangements to put better information in place for people who are planning to undergo cosmetic surgery in Ireland.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 592 together.The total budget for long-term residential care in 2012 is €994.7m. This is effectively the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme albeit that transitional arrangements must also be facilitated from within the subhead, i.e. people in contract beds, people who choose to remain on subvention and people who were in public nursing homes prior to the commencement of the scheme.  Additional funding of €55 million was originally allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme for 2012. However, the Minister for Health subsequently decided to transfer €13 million of the €55 million for a pilot scheme of increased and targeted community care interventions in 2012. The Special Delivery Unit is working with the HSE to develop and implement this pilot scheme.The decision in relation to the transfer of funding was taken following analysis of a report into the care needs assessment process (CSAR process) which determines whether a person requires long-term residential care. The report was based on an audit of 1,200 persons in long-term residential care. It found, among other things, that while in 93% of the cases long-term residential care was recommended,in 40% of the cases the individuals were not considered for interventions such as Home Care Packages. In a further 40% of the cases it is not clear if they were considered for such packages.The HSE's National Service Plan 2012 estimated that a net additional 1,270 people would be supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme by end-2012. However, the €13m transfer outlined above occurred after the Plan was published. The HSE now estimates that it will support a net additional 640 people by end-2012. However, it should be noted that the pilot scheme of increased and targeted community care interventions being developed by the Special Delivery Unit should reduce the number of people applying for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme by ensuring that as many people as possible are empowered to remain in their homes for as long as possible in line with their wishes and Government policy.

The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work. The Terms of Reference for the review are being finalised at present.  The Department will be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	715	As of 17 April, all applications for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which had been determined on or before 16 April had been approved for funding. Therefore, there is no placement list for funding at present.On average, applications for the Scheme take between 4 to 6 weeks to process, from receipt of completed application to date of determination. Depending on the level of complexity of the individual case, processing of the application may take longer. For example, in cases where ancillary State support is sought, additional factors may impact on the timeframe, e.g. the HSE must establish title of a property before a decision can be made and establishing title can be a lengthy process in some cases. This timeframe was the same at this time last year.There was no placement list for funding this time last year. The placement list for funding only came into effect when the scheme re-commenced in June 2011 following a one month suspension while   the examination of funding was being carried out.  As the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is resource capped, the placement list is critical in facilitating the HSE to operate within the budget for the scheme. It also ensures equity of access to funding nationally because applicants are placed on the list in chronological order by date of determination of their application.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	736	I propose to take Questions Nos. 616, 622 and 656 together.Wisdom Services is a voluntary body operated by the Daughters of Wisdom and provides services for people with a disability in the North Western Region.  It supports over 200 service users with 111 on campus, 75 in the community and 20 day attendees.  The HSE contracts for services with Wisdom Services through a service agreement on an annual basis.  Service Agreements are used with a range of providers across many services as the means by which the state contracts for services with voluntary or non statutory providers.  Wisdom Services is not a limited company so the order has a liability for any deficits.Under the HSE National Service Plan 2012, the disability budget nationally is being reduced by 3.7% in 2012.  The NSP states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  I am aware that Wisdom Services is experiencing financial difficulties and has estimated that it will have a significant budget deficit in 2012, even before cost containment measures take effect.  The HSE has been working with Wisdom Services for some time to try and reduce the deficit which has been building up since 2010.  Although Wisdom Services has a cost containment plan for 2012, and has had some success, it still faces significant challenges to address the deficit.I share the HSE's disappointment that a service level agreement to continue the current service has not been agreed at this point for the provision of services in 2012.  The reduction in the budget for 2012 is consistent with other disability service providers in the region.  While the HSE appreciates the difficulties for Wisdom Services, it is not possible for additional funding to be allocated to address the deficit in Cregg House.  In this context, the Department of Health is reassured that the HSE and Wisdom Services are working together to ensure that all service users will continue to receive the care and support they require, and that discussions are ongoing in this regard.  These discussions are also considering the most appropriate arrangements and funding for the various services delivered by Wisdom Services.

Last year the HSE Regional Adoption Services agreed to take responsibility for the adoption files of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society in respect of homes in Bessborough, Co. Cork; St Peters, Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath and Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day-case surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

Savings also arise from the dissolution of Agency Boards, some of which attracted payment of travel and subsistence and/or Board fees.AgencyFunctionThe Office of Tobacco Control (Subsumed into the HSE, 1st January 2011)Advised the Minister for Health and advise him or her in the implementation of policies and objectives of the government, on the control and regulation of tobacco products generallyThe National Social Work Qualification Board (Subsumed into CORU, 31st March 2011)Provided advice to the Minister on matters relating to the qualification of social workers and awarded professional qualifications in social workThe Children Acts Advisory Board (Subsumed into the Minister for Children and youth Affairs, 8th September 2011)Advised the Ministers on policy relating to the co-ordinated delivery of services under the Child Care Act, 1991 (care, protection and welfare) and the Childrens Act, 2001 (detention)The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery (Subsumed into An Bord Altranais, 31st December 2011)Monitored and advised on education and professional development of nurses and midwivesCurrently in 2012, three agencies are being dissolved/subsumed with legislation at various stages of preparation.AgencyFunctionNational Cancer Registry Board (To be dissolved and subsumed into the HSE)To collect information for use in research into the causes of cancer, in education and information programmes, and in the planning of a national cancer strategy to deliver the best cancer care to the whole populationOpticians Board (to be subsumed into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council)The functions of the Board include approval of the education and training of optometrists and dispensing opticians, registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians and control of the practice of optics, in accordance with rules made by the board with the approval of the Minister for HealthDrug Treatment Centre Board (to be dissolved and subsumed into the HSE)The function of the Board is to provide effective, high quality client focused treatment for the population it serves

The models considered will be based on the evaluation of geographical areas, call volumes, road networks and population density. This approach will allow for the appropriate placement of ambulances to meet the demands placed on the service. Examples, apart from existing ambulance stations, could include emergency dispatch points such as fire stations and HSE facilities. However, this process is at an early stage and no agreements have been reached by the National Ambulance Service with potential providers to date.

The report outlines progress made by the HSE, in collaboration with a range of partners, in the further implementation of reforms in intern training. It also raises concerns at the availability of intern posts to cater for the increasing numbers of EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  The HSE has confirmed that the number of applicants for the July 2012 intake of intern posts is substantially less than that originally expected and that the existing number of intern posts is sufficient to cater for the EU applicants remaining in the recruitment process and some non-EU applicants.Projections of the number of EU graduates from Irish medical schools suggest that the increase in graduates will begin to have a significant impact on the availability of intern posts from 2013 onwards. My Department and the HSE are considering a range of short term and longer term options to address this issue.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I propose to take Questions Nos. 641, 646, 655 and 663 together.The Health Service Executive National Service Plan for 2012 sets out a reduction of 3.7% in funding to disability services.  However the Service Plan states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  In this context and as part of the ongoing collaborative work of the National Consultative Forum on Disability, a number of representative organisations and some of their membership have already met to begin a process with the HSE to identify and agree a framework for addressing efficiencies, with minimal impact on frontline services.  The HSE will endeavour to ensure that residential, day, respite and personal assistant services are protected where possible from reductions in frontline services.  As a first step, the HSE has introduced a general reduction of 3.7% from the budget of disability agencies, pending the outcome of its discussions with agencies at a local level.  Pending the implementation of the National Service Plan 2012 reduction, it is not possible at this stage to foresee the allocation for 2013.The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a range of assisted living services, including Personal Assistant service to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant / home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with physical and/or sensory disability.  The HSE aims to minimise the impact of the 3.7% cut on service users and their families as much as possible.  With regard to personal assistant / home support hours, service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service, rather than reducing the number of PA hours.  In this context the HSE National Disability Unit is engaging with each HSE region to identify models and approaches in place pertaining to Personal Assistance and Home Support Services.  This process will identify the precise nature of the services available with the intention of identifying agreed models of service delivery.  A consultation process to progress the agreed models will then take place through the National Consultative Forum on Disability.

There are now 61 Child and Adolescent and 124 Adult Mental Health Teams working throughout the country.  Progress has been made in closing the old traditional psychiatric hospitals and providing appropriate alternative community based facilities.Developments on the Capital Programme are continuing with new Acute Units, Community Mental Health Centres, Residential Facilities, Day Hospitals and Day Centres being developed around the country.  Mental Health projects being progressed include: a 54-bedded long stay facility as part of the Grangegorman Redevelopment Project, an acute in-patient psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the unit at St. Ita's, Portrane, residential units in Clonmel and Wexford etc.  In relation to Child and Adolescent mental health services, two 20-bed in-patient units have been developed in Cork and Galway.  Work is continuing on the development of the second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview which will increase capacity from 6 to 12 beds and the development of an 8 bedded interim facility at St Loman's, Palmerstown.  The Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Day Facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin has also been completed and will open shortly.At the time of publication of A Vision for Change  in 2006, the estimated cost of the implementation of the 7-10 year development programme was €150 million.  Up to the end of 2011, additional development funding of €54m had been allocated to the mental health services for this purpose.  A special allocation of €35m for mental health was announced in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children’s mental health services which will ensure, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes based on an early intervention and recovery approach.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  Some provision will also be made to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with A Vision for Change.  Over 400 additional staff will be recruited to support these initiatives.

In line with international best practice the HSE and the Department of Health are currently developing plans for the effective management of chronic diseases at primary care level.  The initial focus in 2012 is on the establishment of an integrated model of care for the management of patients with diabetes whereby,1. Uncomplicated Type 2 diabetes patients will be managed in primary care only.2. Patients with complicated type 2 diabetes, as defined by the national model of diabetes care, will be managed both by primary and secondary care.3. All patients with Type 1 diabetes, genetic causes of diabetes (MODY diabetes), secondary causes of diabetes, post-transplant diabetes, pregnancy and diabetes will be managed in secondary care only.The integrated model of care for diabetes is to be rolled out on a phased basis as resources permit.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 668, 669 and 674 together.The Government is committed to fundamental reform of the healthcare system with the objective of delivering a single tier health system, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not income. Every citizen will have a choice of insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy.There are a number of key initiatives in the reform programme which will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance. Significant work has already been undertaken to progress these. They include:the strengthening of the primary care sector to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier. The Government has established a Universal Primary Care Project Team to oversee the introduction of universal primary care.  In addition, the Government has given its approval to the preparation of Heads of a Bill to progress the phased introduction of free GP care in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. It is envisaged that the first phase in the Programme will provide for the extension of access to GP services without fees to persons with illnesses or disabilities to be prescribed by regulations under the new legislation.reform of the acute hospital sector, including the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) which has been tasked with unblocking access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  An important part of the Programme for Government is the establishment of independent not-for-profit trusts. As a first step, non-statutory hospital groups will be set up which will have a single clinical governance model, one budget and one employment ceiling. I clearly set out my policy on the formation of hospital groups in my letter of 28 March 2012 to the Chairman of the HSE as a Direction under Section 10 of the Health Act 2004. In this letter I stated that I intend to revert to my colleagues in Government to agree the arrangements for, and make up of, hospital groups where they are not already in existence. Preliminary work in this regard is already underway within the Special Delivery Unit. The hospital groups will be established on the clear understanding that the groupings and their governance arrangements will be reviewed prior to 2015 to ensure an appropriate environment for the introduction of UHI.the introduction of the more transparent and efficient  "Money Follows the Patient" funding mechanism for acute hospitals.  A number of initiatives are already underway including a patient level costing project and a pilot initiative in relation to prospective funding of certain elective orthopaedic procedures, at selected sites.In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance. The Group is tasked with helping to develop detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and to actively drive implementation of various elements of the health reform programme.  The Group held its first meeting on 1 March 2012 and a second meeting took place on 4 April 2012. A project team comprised of senior Department of Health officials has also been established to support the work of the Implementation Group.The initial work of the Group will focus on overseeing reform work in relation to the following work streams:—Hospital Financing (e.g. Money-follows-the-patient, Hospital Care Purchase Agency),Hospital Structures (e.g. Hospital Trusts),Regulation of the Hospital Sector (e.g. Patient Safety Authority, Licensing),Health Insurance Market (e.g. Risk Equalisation, Minimum Benefits),Overarching UHI Design (e.g. detailed design of the UHI system, including the legislative framework and the package of services to be covered).In certain respects, we are fortunate in being at the early stages of the reform process in that it enables us to learn from and use the experiences of other countries to inform, develop and advance implementation proposals. To that end, during 2011 my officials undertook a study visit to the Netherlands to examine the Dutch health insurance model and also hosted a seminar which was attended by international experts. In addition, the Implementation Group on UHI comprises both those with executive responsibilities within the health service and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies. However, I should point out that, ultimately, this Government's reform proposals will be designed to meet the needs of the Irish system and to ensure the best outcomes for Irish patients.The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years. The Implementation Group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and will oversee different elements of the reforms as they are being put in place. It is also intended that it will consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.

Ketamine is a controlled substance under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. To date, in Ireland, a small number of samples found to contain methoxetamine have been seized by Gardaí.  My Department works closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Gardaí, the Revenue Customs Service, the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Irish Medicines Board and others to monitor the emergence of new psychoactive substances with a view to bringing these substances under control where necessary.  Approximately 200 substances were controlled in May 2010 and a further 60 in November 2011.Furthermore, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 makes it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which may not be specifically controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have psychoactive effects.  My Department in conjunction with other relevant organisations is closely monitoring availability of methoxetamine, and I will not hesitate to seek Government approval to ban the substance based on evidence that it poses a risk to public health.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Our country has suffered a significant economic crisis which has led to a large fall in Exchequer revenues.  Tax revenues fell from €47.25 billion in 2007 to €34 billion in 2010, a fall of 28% in just four years.  We are now endeavouring to re-build our revenue base but we do not have the resources to fund all the services that we would like to provide.  It is the Government's priority therefore to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that frontline services are protected while ensuring that patient safety remains the highest priority.  The challenge for the health service has been to reduce the cost of providing care whilst maintaining and developing services to the maximum level possible within the available resources.  The funding of the health services has been considered in the overall context of the state of the public finances, the need to control public expenditure and to meet the fiscal targets set out in the Programme for Government.The 2010 Budget for the health services provided for €659 million in pay savings and €400m in non-pay savings.  The pay savings of €659 million took account of general pay reductions, and higher reductions for those on higher pay on foot of the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration along with savings associated with the moratorium on recruitment and promotion.  The non-pay savings of €400 million concentrated on areas which would not have a significant impact on front line services, such as reductions in drugs costs, further economies in areas such as procurement, and improved private income collection by public hospitals.In 2011 further price reductions were applied in relation to pharmaceuticals, to achieve full year savings of €200 million in the cost of drugs.  Further reductions in GP fees under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest Act 2009 were applied, and the charge for treating private patients in public hospitals was increased by 21%.  Along with further procurement economies, and reductions in pay as a result of the voluntary exit schemes, the objective was to mitigate as far as possible against affecting front-line services.

The trend, based on a three year rolling average has dropped from an average of 11 fatalities per annum to an average of ten fatalities per annum over the period, with the actual figure for 2011 being seven fatalities.Initiatives that have been undertaken to increase safety awareness include the publication of a booklet entitled the "Code of Practice for the Safe Operation for Recreational Craft" and the issuing of Marine Notices which communicate important safety information to the maritime community.  Marine Notices have issued, for example, on matters relating to the carriage of inflatable life rafts on small fishing vessels, safe manning of vessels including hours of work and Marine notices updating the Code of Practice for small fishing vessels and guidance on the selection of Personal Flotation Devices (PDFs) for use on board pleasure craft are planned for later this year.  The legislative basis underpinning maritime safety is also being updated to take account of the International Conventions relating to the welfare and training of Seafarers and various general aspects of maritime safety.Other recent initiatives include investment in a new Search and Rescue helicopter programme which will result in a more effective and efficient helicopter service, upgrading the Coast Guard's road transport and small boat fleet and updating the training framework for all Coast Guard volunteers.  In addition, a new Integrated Communication System (ICS), which is operational at the new National Maritime Operations Centre (NMOC) in Dublin will be installed at Malin by mid-2012, and at MRSC Valentia possibly by year end.

The Committee responded to me on 28 March in a comprehensive report which contained a number of recommendations, many of which will be reflected in the resulting legislation.The Committee made several recommendations in relation to the level of declamping fees, to which I will have regard in framing the legislation.  With regard to recent suggestions that clamping fees should be increased, the current maximum declamping fee that may be charged by public authorities for parking offences on public land was statutorily set in 1998 at £65 which, with the introduction of the euro, translated to €80.  My Department has begun drafting the necessary legislation to regulate the clamping industry and I expect to be in a position to introduce a Bill in the Oireachtas later this year.  In light of the forthcoming legislation, I have no proposals at present to modify the current arrangements in relation to declamping fees.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, responsibility for the delivery of public transport infrastructure, including the provision of cycling facilities in the Greater Dublin Area, is a matter for the NTA.  Under its Sustainable Transport Management Grants Scheme, the NTA provides funding to local authorities for a range of schemes to benefit cyclists including cycle paths and cycle corridors.  Parking facilities for bicycles is also being provided at a number of rail and Luas stations.  Funding is also being provided by my Department through the NTA to relevant local authorities in the four regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford for a programme of public transport and sustainable measures and projects.  These measures include the provision of a variety of cycling initiatives to include cycle corridors and cycle parking.The proposal to facilitate car parking at rail stations for onward travel by bicycle raises some issues.  Many of the car parks at rail stations are already heavily utilised by people parking their cars and taking the rail service to their destination.  Releasing some of that limited car parking space and dedicating it to onward cycle based travel would potentially reduce public transport use, in that some people would be unable to obtain the car parking necessary for them to use the rail service.  Equally the distance to be travelled by bicycle would be a negating factor in a lot of locations.  However, the Department and the NTA will continue to develop and deliver the various measures that support increased cycle use including availing of opportunities to increase cycling potential associated with the rail network.  There is a private carpark at Navan Road Parkway Station which is well served by bus from Dublin 15 and East Meath.

Action No. 119 of the current Road Safety Strategy provides for the research and evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative correction/rehabilitation programmes for such offenders.  My Department, the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality are currently analysing international best practice in this area.  I anticipate receiving the recommendations arising from that analysis in the Summer and will, at that time, consider those recommendations in the context of current road traffic legislation, in consultation with the Courts Service, the Gardaí and the Department of Justice and Equality.  It should be noted that legislation would be required.

No new ones have been established.  Dundalk Port Company was merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, while Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1 January 2012.  The Board of Harbour Commissioners ceased to exist in each case.  The current intention is that the last remaining harbour under the auspices of my Department, Bantry Bay, will be transferred to a more appropriate governance framework over the course of the next year.My Department is also currently engaged in a review of ports policy which will, inter alia, consider the issue of port company restructuring.  The merger of Dublin Tourism with its parent body, Fáilte Ireland, is now complete, while Coaching Ireland has been subsumed into the Irish Sports Council.  The Public Service Reform Plan, www.reformplan.per.gov.ie, sets out full details of all agencies, including those under the aegis of my Department, which are to be rationalised in 2012 and 2013 and also those which are subject to critical review to be completed by June of this year.  It is not possible to quantify the potential savings from rationalisation until the detailed arrangements in respect of each implementation have been worked through with the agencies in question.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Prelude	796	Some 35 Rural Community Transport Groups are currently being funded under my Department's Rural Transport Programme (RTP) to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from lack of access to public transport.  Older people and people with disabilities form the core customer base of the RTP which is operating in every county.  According to 2010 performance monitoring figures, approximately 81% of services were defined as either fully (45%) or partially accessible(36%).  In addition, many RTP services have passenger assistants on board their vehicles.In line with a recent Government decision, I announced plans on 28 February to achieve greater levels of transport integration and co-ordinated delivery across a range of exchequer funded local and rural transport services incorporating the RTP, HSE non-acute transport, school transport and voluntary transport services.  The National Transport Authority, which has been allocated responsibility for the RTP will, in conjunction with a national committee made up of key stakeholders, develop proposals for future integration based on a series of pilots which will trial how services in rural areas can be further enhanced and optimised while achieving necessary efficiencies.  Accessibility will remain a core criterion in the further development of RTP.  Public Transport accessibility is being progressed under the umbrella of Transport Access for All, which is my Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005.  The RTP has a key role in that regard.  The plan is under review.  It is hoped to publish an updated plan later this year.
