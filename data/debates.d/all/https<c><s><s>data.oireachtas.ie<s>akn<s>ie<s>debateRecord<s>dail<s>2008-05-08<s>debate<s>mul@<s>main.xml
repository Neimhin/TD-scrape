I was going to comment to the effect that it would have been desperate if the President had not accepted any of the nominations he put forward.

We should like to see a change given that the House has a new Taoiseach, a new system and a new Leader.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national and local importance, namely, the urgent need to discuss the serious crisis in the HSE as regards subvention payments, where clients or patients have been asked to pay the increased charges being imposed by nursing homes, some of them since 1 January 2008.  In one situation, a person aged 100 may have to return home where there is no individual to care for him, apart from his son.  In another case, a couple with Alzheimer's disease were assessed for their further increase of €300 per week, while the HSE had been allocated €110 million towards the fair deal project, which was never implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, now the Minister for Finance — good luck to him — received the Morris tribunal report on 24 April.  It was published yesterday, which was statutorily the last day to do so.  Was there a reason that it was not published before the statutory deadline was about to be reached?  In view of the importance of this element of the Morris tribunal now being available and given that the Tánaiste is a Member from the county involved, can I take it we will have an opportunity to discuss this report in the House?  Will she give consent to the new Whip to approve that debate?  It is a matter of very serious import for the conduct of the Garda, for those involved and for ordinary citizens.  I hope the Tánaiste will give consent to an early discussion in the House on this first element of the Morris tribunal.</p>

When is it proposed to introduce the legislation giving statutory effect to the National Property Services Regulatory Authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_31">What is the Tánaiste's view in respect of the siting of the Central Mental Hospital at Thornton Hall?  Evidence is now very clear that this is the wrong thing to do.  Is there a change of Government policy in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Now that we have a reformed or recycled Government, as somebody said yesterday, what is the position on the reintroduction of the long-term residential care services Bill?  This was to be rammed through before Christmas by the Minister for Health and Children, who is not present.  We were given consistent responses from the previous Taoiseach that this was on its way very shortly.  However, there now appear to be some constitutional difficulties with it.  It is a matter of very considerable import to thousands of people, as the Tánaiste well knows.  Can I take it that we will have an accurate report as to when it will be introduced in the House?</p>

There was a statutory framework within which the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform worked as he indicated publicly today.  It was a very short timeframe.  On the basis of that short timeframe, the Garda Commissioner wished to prepare his response.  It was on that basis that it was statute-bound and published yesterday.  We are not averse to the Deputy's request for a debate on the matter and I am sure it can be raised with the Whips in due course when time allows for that discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I also wish to raise the issue of the Morris tribunal report.  Publication of that report yesterday on the day when the Government was being formed was an act of political cynicism.  It reminded me of the press officer in the UK who circulated a memorandum on 11 September 2001 suggesting to Ministers if they had any bad news to release, it would be a good day to do so.  I heard the explanation of the Minister for Finance this morning.  While I accept yesterday was the final day, there was nothing to prevent the publication of that report earlier than yesterday.  The publication at lunchtime on the day the Government was being formed was clearly a well news-managed event.  It does not behove any new practices on the part of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I ask about the arrangements for a debate on it.  This is a report with very serious conclusions.  I ask the Tánaiste whether that debate will take place next week.  I understand a Whips' meeting is to take place immediately after the Order of Business, so I presume the Government has already decided the business the House will deal with next week.  Will the debate on the Morris tribunal report take place next week?</p>
          <p eId="para_45">As I am on the subject of news management, I did not want to raise this matter in this forum yesterday because it was a feel-good day around here.  However, I want to protest very strongly at the disrespect the Government showed for this House yesterday.  The Taoiseach was asked to extend the time for the debate on the formation of Government merely by an hour.  In a very arrogant way he refused to do so.  It was clear what was going on.</p>

These are now public documents that are laid before the Oireachtas.  I have the same regard as all of us for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the publication in no way marries the way in which this matter has been dealt with.  It is statute bound.  It is publicly available.  As I have indicated, we will be forthcoming in organising a debate to discuss it.  To be prudent in the better use of time and time management, it may be better to afford the opportunity for the other two reports to be discussed.

          <p eId="para_85">Senior Government spokespersons have been quoted in newspapers recently as saying the fair deal Bill relating to long-term residential care services is looking less and less likely.  It is time the Government was up front about this because it keeps missing deadlines.  It is clear to me, as a solicitor who worked in property, that there is a problem.  A clause in the Constitution says the State cannot pass a law to abolish people's rights to leave or inherit property and I see difficulties in this regard.</p>

While I will not ask anything relating to the Department of Finance on the Minister's first day, I will ask a question about the road traffic Bill.

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_285">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving Fine Gael the opportunity of raising on Private Members' time an important issue which is concentrating the minds of many of the 500,000 people who live in apartments and mixed developments in urban areas.  There are approximately 303,000 apartments in Ireland, including the 60,000 built since 2005, along with 4,600 management companies.  The motion sets out the problem as well as the actions the Government can take to resolve it.  I shall describe the background to the issues, while my colleagues will make proposals in regard to the required remedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Home owners are experiencing a significant information deficit in regard to their rights and responsibilities, particular in the area of management companies and agents and the varying management fees levied on individuals.  On various occasions during the past several years, Deputies have asked the Government its proposals for finding solutions to these issues.  Every Deputy has been contacted by home owners regarding the types of charges levied, the responsibilities of management companies and the abuse by some companies of the manner by which they are established under company law and the fees they charge.  The information we are putting before the House is not new because the problems associated with management companies and apartment living have long been identified.  Organisations such as the National Consumer Agency, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Dublin City Council and the Law Reform Commission have produced reports and made recommendations on improving the present situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In 2006 the National Consumer Agency published a report on the property management sector entitled Management Fees and Service Charges Levied on Owners of Property in Multi-Unit Dwellings, which examined the sector and made 25 key recommendations on regulation of the industry and protective measures for consumers relating to transfer of control, service charges and sinking funds.  The report also recommended the establishment of a professional body and qualifications for those working in the industry.  The agency also produced a helpful booklet, Property Management Companies and You, which set out in clear terms the manner in which money was being extorted in the absence of proper accounts.  There is extensive evidence to suggest that management companies are extorting money through false pretences.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">In December 2006 the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement commenced a public consultation process on the governance of property management companies, with a particular focus on apartment developments.  The office is currently assessing the responses to its consultation with a view to producing recommendations in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Dublin City Council has produced two comprehensive reports on apartment living and the problems associated with management companies.  The first report examined the strengths and weakness of the existing system, while the second investigated survey charges, design and owners' attitudes in 193 private apartment schemes in Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Law Reform Commission has also been examining this issue for the past year and is due to report on it at the end of May.  I look forward to seeing the recommendations it makes because the issue is pertinent to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I welcome the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  The issue gives rise to cross-departmental concerns in the areas of property rights, legal standing of property and, from the perspective of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, company law in respect of ownership and the type of companies established to manage complexes.  I do not wish to minimise the difficulties involved.  If the problem was an easy one to solve, the Law Reform Commission would not have to get involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">In the case of multi-unit developments and gated estates, many complexes include both internal and external common areas accessible to all occupiers.  These typically include lobbies, halls, stairwells, lifts, corridors and roofs.  Owners collectively share common areas and, as part of a management company, enter into legal arrangements that create certain rights and obligations.  The need for a management company arose in the first instance to manage all common areas and services in a complex not belonging to or being the responsibility of an individual.  Abuse occurs at present where owners of management companies retain ownership of a certain number of apartments and do not pass responsibility for management of the complex to all apartment owners as a single corporate entity, which would allow the latter to run their own affairs at a reasonable price rather than having figures picked out of the air in the absence of proper accounts and timelines on the establishment of structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Members and owners of management companies were supposed to make the key decisions on whether to manage the complex themselves or appoint a professional management agent.  Most auctioneer firms in Dublin would consider becoming management or letting agents.  I declare an interest in that I pay management fees for a property I inhabit in Dublin when I conduct my parliamentary business.  It is difficult to know where exactly the money goes and how it is calculated.  The accounts may look very fine at the end of the year but the devil is in the detail for many of these companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">People from various parts of the country have written to Deputies about this problem.  Increasing numbers of people live in mixed apartment units and townhouses.  Dwelling patterns in Ireland have become denser, particularly in the centre of urban areas, and people have various options for living as close as possible to their places of work.  That is a welcome development but they should not be penalised by the unregulated developments currently taking place.  Of the total number of dwellings built in 2005, apartments comprised 53% in Dublin city and county, 25% in Limerick city, 22% in each of counties Kildare and Wicklow and 18% in each of counties Louth, Galway and Cork.  These substantial proportions indicate the size of the problem we face.  It is expected that the 2006 census will reveal that the current estimate of 303,000 apartments has increased to 500,000.  A further 50,000 to 100,000 people who live in traditional townhouse developments are also subject to management charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The regulations and primary legislation needed to deal with these issues are lacking but Fine Gael is offering the Government an opportunity to consider with urgency the remedies needed.  For the past several years questions have been raised on the matter in this House and commitments have been made in regard to legislation.  The former Taoiseach spoke a number of times on the Order of Business about the difficulties of addressing the issues involved.  Nevertheless I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform understand that once the Law Reform Commission report comes to his Department, we should not see it put to one side and not dealt with.  It is a massive consumer issue which we feel strongly about.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The new Government has made reform a key priority.  There is no more urgent matter in the housing area than the reform of the management company and agency area.  An authority was set up on an interim basis in 2005 to bring about some kind of reform in this sector, which indicates that the issue affects many constituents.  It cannot be properly brought into focus or effect until such time as we have primary legislation on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The people who are most affected by these issues are young families and professionals purchasing their first home, as well as many newly-arrived workers.  They are facing possible negative equity and the last thing they want is to pay management company fees at a time when mortgage rates have increased nine or ten times in the past couple of years.  Every penny counts at this stage for many people, and they wish to know the service charge they have to pay is being spent properly or if it is being spent at all.  They wish to receive in a more transparent way the type of information they are entitled to as consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The problem is not exclusive to large urban areas, although it is a major issue there.  It is concentrated in such areas and many people living in high-density dwellings feel nobody is looking out for them or their rights.  This Government has an obligation to do so but has not indicated, in terms of primary legislation, any urgency on the matter in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">We have had much investment and tax breaks introduced in these major urban areas over the years for property developers.  They have achieved higher densities than would normally be expected in the centre of urban areas.  That has been laid down through national regulation in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There is no point in allowing developers to get the benefits of tax breaks and management agents and companies to extort money from consumers and people living in those complexes without regulating the type of policy which would be appropriate to a very important consumer issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Many apartment blocks have been built around the country without linkage to transport arteries, green spaces, facilities for families or energy efficiency.  The lack of planning for properly organised management structures in these developments is a policy failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Potential solutions to this will be dealt with by my colleagues, Deputies Terence Flanagan and Mitchell.  I ask that under the planning and development Acts, companies Acts and frameworks which can be set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day, amendments be brought forward to treat this matter seriously.  A cross-departmental solution is required, as I indicated earlier, and this side of the House will facilitate the Minister in bringing forward proposals at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure people understand before buying an apartment or townhouse or entering high-density living that there is transparency in the way their costs are levied.  They should understand people are not allowed to get away with the type of unregulated approach to modern urban living in a way that has been the case in so many apartment complexes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_301">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his move to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and wish him well in his new role.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fine Gael Private Members' motion before the House this morning and thank my colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, for helping to bring this motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to put the office of the regulator — the national property services regulatory authority — on a statutory footing and give it proper powers and adequate resources to regulate both management companies and management agents.  We want to see the annual service charge set in a fair and transparent manner, and the provision of a sinking fund to take care of the long-term maintenance issues should be made mandatory for every management company.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Company law should be amended to allow a name change from management company to owners' company as soon as the control of the management company is transferred from the developer to the owners.  We are also calling on the Government to have developers transfer more quickly control of a completed development to the owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The reason we must bring this motion before the Dáil is simply the inaction of this Government on this issue.  In 2002, the programme for Government put together by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats stated the Government would consider the introduction of legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of property management companies.  Yet six years later this legislation has not been introduced and we are still talking about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The Government introduced a draft Bill in 2006 and also established the National Property Services Regulatory Authority to regulate management companies in July 2006.  A director and staff were appointed then on a non-statutory basis and a budget of €700,000 has been allocated to this office in 2007, with €930,000 in 2008.  No legislation has come before this House to regulate management companies.  What we currently have is yet another quango where a director and staff have been appointed with a substantial budget but the office has no statutory powers to regulate the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Today, problems continue with management companies because of the Government's slow-footed approach.  Apartment owners remain unprotected as they have been neglected by this Government.  Approximately 500,000 people live in apartments and mixed-unit developments.  They are mainly young people, paying service charges on average of €1,500 per annum to approximately 4,600 management companies.  This figure has increased almost threefold in the last six years alone.  Multi-unit apartments and mixed developments are a feature of modern living and will continue to increase as we move towards higher urban densities and more environmentally sustainable living.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Property management companies in Ireland must be regulated, which is the basis of the motion before the House.  We understand their necessity, as they exist to maintain common areas, as Deputy Hogan noted, such as halls, stairs, lifts and gardens, as well as areas which are accessible to everyone living in the building.  They own the freehold of the common areas, which apartment owners are not always aware of.  Apartment owners have a leasehold on the apartment they purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">In new developments the general practice is that a management company is incorporated by the developer or his solicitor before any units are sold.  The vast majority of the management companies deal with apartment blocks, although it is also possible for them to be set up in housing estates.  The management company collects a service charge from all owners in the complex and is responsible for providing a sinking fund to cover repairs and long-term expenditure.  Management companies may manage the operation of the development themselves or employ a management agent to undertake responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Over the past number of years it has become apparent there are many problems in this area with management companies which must be dealt with.  In my own constituency of Dublin North-East, apartment owners are contacting my office on a daily basis highlighting the problems they have with management companies.  As a result of the huge volume of phone calls and correspondence relating to this matter, it was necessary for me to hold a public meeting recently on the issue.  At this meeting, owners of apartments voiced their strong concerns about the fact that the Government has not regulated the sector.  They also highlighted that it is a free-for-all with some management companies and management agents ripping off their owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Some of the problems associated with management companies include confusion among the public regarding the terms "management company" and "management agent".  There is an information deficit among homebuyers as to their rights and responsibilities.  Many people feel they were ill-advised by their solicitor or estate agent about management companies and agents when they signed their contract for their new apartment.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">There is a lack of transparency with some management companies which do not hold annual general meetings.  Some of the ones that hold such meetings do not inform all their members about the meeting.  There is a failure of some management companies to provide the members of their management company with financial information.  For example, this might relate to the income and expenditure accounts relating to the performance of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">There is no transparency on service charges and the calculation of the charge. Management agents charge different rates.  Some of these rates are good, while others are extremely bad.  There is no value for money and there is a difference in the level of rates.  The rate one pays depends on where one's home is located.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Service charges in Dublin ranged between €400 and €4,000 per annum.  They are normally set at a low level initially as a method of enticing prospective buyers and higher charges are normally imposed in subsequent years, with no come-back for the homeowner.  Service charges have been used to rectify snagging problems with developments, which is wrong.  Some management companies have not established sinking funds and this will cause difficulties for apartment complexes in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">There is a lack of information regarding the importance of service charges.  The law is that people cannot sell their apartments until all outstanding service charges are paid.  This is not explained to those who wish to purchase apartments.  There is a lack of information for homeowners and, as a result, these individuals blame their management agents for the problems affecting their complexes and do not pay the service charges.  Ultimately, this has a knock-on effect on the owners of apartments because the value of their investments deteriorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">In many instances, the control of management companies is not handed over to owners until the last unit has been sold.  Some developers remain on as directors for many years.  This prevents owners from electing the directors of their choice.  In theory, a developer is supposed to leave the development when all units are sold and hand over charge of the management company.  However, this is not happening in practice.  In addition, complaints boards, to which residents can voice their grievances about their management companies or agents, are not being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Many management agents have no experience of the requirements under company law requirements and they operate in an industry that is unregulated.  Some management companies fail to complete annual returns and this may result in their being struck off the companies register and apartment owners being unable to sell their properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I recently received an e-mail  from a constituent regarding some of the problems she has encountered at the apartment complex in which she lives.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_318">I moved into my apartment in December.  Unfortunately, from the moment I moved in, myself and the other residents have been faced with on-going problems.  The complex itself is still under construction so there have been many teething problems for example, flooded carpark, lifts not working, lights not working and even a sewage leak.  I appreciate that these types of problems are to be expected (with the exception of the sewage leak), as the complex is brand new.  However, my main worry is the access to the complex.  We can access the complex through the underground carpark or by using the pedestrian walkway.  The pedestrian walkway is a long wooden manbuilt tunnel, which I feel is very unsafe — particularly at night.  I would never use the walkway at night on my own . . . . it's dark, very long and you have no idea who could be waiting for you at either end.  The walkway is also very secluded.  I really feel that this walkway is very dangerous — in the day time and especially at night.  The other option is to go through the underground carpark.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_319">At the moment, if I do go out in the evenings, I have to stay in my parents or friends houses as I simply can't access my home in a safe way.  Taxis can only drop residents off at a side road leading up to the complex.  Then residents can either access the carpark using their swipecard and walk across the deserted (and flooded) carpark or worse, risk the pedestrian walkway.  As I'm sure you can imagine, neither of these options appeal me. I'm too scared to try either.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_320">My friends came to visit recently and used the pedestrian walkway, which leads to the gates of the complex.  When they reached the end of the walkway, they found two young men there and they were drinking.  This is exactly my point — this area is completely hidden from the main road.  Anybody could be waiting for you and you literally have nowhere to go.  Unless you turn back and run the length of the walkway.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">I have contacted the builders about this and have asked them what plans they have once the complex is complete but my request for information has been left unanswered.  My family, friends and even taxi drivers are in utter shock when they see how we have to access our homes.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_322">There is security on complex but I never see any security guards at night.  In fact two cars were stolen from our carpark recently.  I also saw three teenagers climbing over the complex wall (they used ladders the builder had left out, so it was very easy for them) and they walked straight to the stairs that leads to the carpark.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_323">The builders are obviously unconcerned about the obvious dangers in the complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">This is just one example of the problems people are experiencing with their management companies on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Another constituent contacted me by e-mail and outlined the issues in respect of which no one is willing to provide them with assistance.  All this person wants is answers but unfortunately these have not been forthcoming from the builder, the management company or the management agent.  The e-mail to which I refer states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_326">I purchased my apartment off the plans in Oct 2006 and finally got my keys in Dec 07, but to be honest I really didn't know what I was buying.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_327">I am very happy with my property however the development itself is in an awful state.  Myself and a number of neighbours have been in constant contact with our management company over issues we are having but we have been passed back and forth between the management company and builders each other claiming the other is responsible for dealing with our queries.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_328">There is also NO visitor parking in or around the development.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_329">Our underground car park has also been flooded since we moved in December, every time there is the slighted drop of rain we are flooded, although I think the builders are trying to rectify this.  But if you [had] seen the state of the place you would be shocked.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_330">My other major grievance is that the external walls of our apartments these have been left unfinished.  When I snagged my property I brought up the state of the external wall and I was told like my neighbours that these would be finished at a later date as there was still building going on around us and this work would be completed when development is finished . . . I have mentioned this to our management company who have now informed me that this is not the case that they think our apartments will be left this way.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_331">I have tried to contact the builders to ask them but have had no luck.  When we [saw] the show apartments the external walls had either nice red brick or [were] painted a cream colour while our apartments have [a] rough grey concrete finish.  Its really horrible and basically just looks unfinished.  If we bought our property based on the show apartments surely our homes should be completed to the same standard.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">At the minute we have paid expensive management fees of €1,500 but no one seems to want to help us.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">This is one further example of the problems with which a regulator might deal.  We are seeking that such a regulator be appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">It should be acknowledged that much work has been completed in this area by the Law Reform Commission, which has commissioned reports on the need for the regulation of management companies and agents.  Dublin City Council must be commended on taking the lead in this area by producing two reports, namely, Successful Apartment Living, parts 1 and 2.  The city council also established an apartment owners forum to discuss the problems people living in apartment complexes experience on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Director of Corporate Enforcement also produced a report entitled The Governance of Apartment Owners' Management Companies.  He is responsible for taking action against directors who do not take their responsibilities seriously and is to be commended on the good work he is doing.  In addition to the reports to which I have referred, the National Consumer Agency published a report on the property management sector in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I welcome the Government amendment to the motion, which commits it to publishing the property services regulatory authority Bill.  The latter will provide for the establishment of a licensing system for regulating property management agents.  The Government amendment indicates that this long-awaited legislation will be published during the current session.  However, actions speak louder than words and we hope that the legislation will be forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Government must get real in respect of this issue.  It must appoint a regulator and give him or her statutory powers and adequate resources.  Young homeowners are struggling to make their mortgage repayments and are becoming increasingly aware of their outgoings.  On average, these people are obliged to pay service charges of €1,500 per annum.  That is a bridge too far, particularly because the money is going to an industry that is unregulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I hope the Minister will take on board the points I have made.  I also hope he will appoint a regulator and provide him or her with statutory powers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_339">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I checked my records this morning and saw I had first raised this issue in April 2005.  In November of that year, Fine Gael had a Private Members' motion suggesting reforms and regulatory control of property management companies along the lines of Deputy Hogan's proposal.  However, here we are in 2008 and nothing has happened despite the promises made on many occasions since that time.  Meanwhile, the building boom has come and gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">In urban Ireland, certainly in my constituency, that boom has consisted almost entirely of apartment building rather than the building of conventional houses.  In my constituency, the ratio is 8:1.  Any legislation we now pass is too late to help the many new home owners over those years.  This drift is causing problems not just for those buying apartments, but for the rest of us who live in urban Ireland.  It is now the dominant home form, certainly in Dublin, and if there are problems, this will impact on all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It has been heartbreaking to see the difficulties, the lack of information and sometimes the downright robbery young starter home buyers have been subjected to.  Equally worrying is the future impact on the environment if this area is not regulated.  Given the value that we place on home ownership in Ireland and the high incidence of home ownership, which is probably the highest in the world, it is inexplicable that we have made absolutely no move to protect the owners of this significant part of the housing stock.  We can assume it will continue to be a significant part of the housing stock because urban land will become scarcer and it is inevitable that we will build in a more compact form.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">As my colleague said, there are now approximately one third of a million apartments in Ireland.  That is not bad in itself.  It is good that it gives young people an opportunity to get into the property market, gives older people an opportunity to downsize and facilitates worker mobility.  All of these factors are positive but unless we, as legislators, regulate the sector and ensure that owners are protected, what is the biggest investment in their lives for many young people will eventually become an unsaleable asset.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">For every urban public representative, the same story is coming from apartment owners — lack of information, lack of transparency, poor planning, lack of control of their own management companies, of which they do not seem to realise they are members, and, in some cases, downright abuse by developers of unsuspecting new, young home purchasers.  Not to put a tooth in it, developers write contracts to suit developers.  They then collect management fees from the hapless purchasers and in some cases use them to finish apartment blocks which others will buy.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The crucial point is developers are allowed to control the management companies until all of the blocks are completed and until it suits them to move out.  Meanwhile, they collect fees from the individual owners but do not themselves pay fees for the residences that remain in their ownership.  The hapless purchaser signs the contract.  I have seen cases where the fees are then used to clean the windows of the next apartment block, to prettify the development so the developer can sell more houses or even to finish off the development, which the developer is required to do in any case under the planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Why do owners sign up to these contracts, which are so clearly not in their interest and put them in such an unfavourable and powerless position?  One of the reasons is the egregious practice of builders offering to pay the fees of the solicitor of the purchaser.  Obviously, the builders do a deal with the solicitors to do a job lot of conveyancing.  The young buyer, not realising the implications of this, thinks it is great and signs up for it but the solicitor is not going to look after the interests of the buyer in the way he or she would if the buyer was paying.  It is human nature and is inevitable that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  They will not upset their paymasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I was horrified by the lack of basic advice being given by solicitors to new home owners in some cases.  They would not even advise them of basic issues such as to examine their development plan or consider what is perhaps planned for next door.  Many young purchasers get a big shock when they eventually find out what is to be built next door.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Reform of this area, along the lines of the Fine Gael motion, must involve mandatory use of standard contracts such as those that now apply in the rental sector.  Full information must be made available to purchasers about what they own, what they own in common with other buyers, what their duties and responsibilities are as shareholders, the need for a sinking fund and the reality of escalating annual service charges.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to those young purchasers to empower them and to ensure they control and manage their own affairs, and have the information to protect their joint investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">We must also regulate the property management companies which are springing up.  This is a great new area for people with absolutely no training who can set themselves up as property managers.  It requires no training or registration, yet they control huge amounts of owners' money.  It is outrageous that there is no control in this area.  While I do not want to suggest all builders or developers are involved, nevertheless, there is a widespread practice whereby the builder sets up a property management company.  He does not pay into it but all the other home owners do and the money is effectively at the disposal of the builder, through his son or some other indirect mechanism through which he controls the property management company.  The unfortunate owners cannot sack the property management company because the builder has maintained control of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Nonetheless, the one point I want to stress above all is the danger of people not paying management company fees.  It should be brought home to people that management fees are inevitable where there are common areas to be maintained and where the exterior of a building is the joint responsibility of the owners.  If the fees are not paid, there can be no maintenance.  The exterior becomes shabby and values fall.  People cannot sell and when they move out, renters move in.  The owner has even less interest and fewer fees are paid, and the spiral of degradation is almost inevitable.  This will affect the environment of all and is the biggest threat to the value of apartment owners who fail or refuse to pay.  It also places a huge burden on those who do pay.  It is in everybody's interest that everybody pays and understands when they sign up that they will have to pay in perpetuity.  Lack of maintenance and the absence of a sinking fund to cater for large-scale external repairs will produce a spiral of degradation.  Rundown or shabby apartment blocks are not in anybody's interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Regulatory reform must include a well-publicised certainty that unpaid fees will be recouped by the management company when the apartment is being sold.  This is not understood by people who decide it is a mug's game and that they will not bother paying management fees.  As a long-term solution there should be a lien on the property and owners should know this.  In the short term, there should also be a mandatory "name and shame" option involving mandatory notification to all complex owners of those who fail to pay their management charge.  This would help to ensure compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Abuse of controlling positions in management companies by some developers has already led to a resentment and a negative attitude to paying management fees by many apartment owners.  This will become a real problem where developers are no longer selling their apartments but are maintaining ownership of them and renting them out.  Given that the housing market has weakened and with many developers retaining ownership, it is imperative that they cannot use their extra voting power in the management company to disadvantage individual owners and, crucially, that they are obliged to pay the management fee for every apartment that they retain.  Otherwise, the buyer loses, which seems to be the norm in this relationship, which is unfair to young purchasers.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It is essential that we have regulatory reform along the lines suggested in this motion.  I ask the Minister to take the motion seriously.  It is a vital issue in urban Ireland because this is becoming the way people live.  If apartment blocks do not succeed, God help us all because it will destroy urban Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">I thank the Acting Chairman and the Members opposite for their remarks and I look forward to working with them in a spirit of co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Having read the file pertaining to this matter late last night and this morning, I do not believe this is an issue on which the House should divide.  We are all of the very strong view that action needs to be taken in this area as quickly as possible.  I have great sympathy with the content of the Fine Gael motion and believe it has a lot in common with the Government amendment.  I suggest that, at the end of this debate, we might adopt a reasonable approach.  One aspect of the Government's approach is that it believes the Fine Gael motion is a little too prescriptive given that the issue is much wider than it suggests.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It is important to put the Government's position on record.  Recent years have indeed witnessed very rapid and significant growth in the numbers of people living in multi-unit developments.  While apartment living is a common feature in many other countries, it is a relatively recent phenomenon here.  Some of the difficulties now being experienced by owners of units in multi-unit developments stem from the fact that the current legal framework is ill-suited in many ways to deal with the problems arising in regard to this form of residential accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I assure the House that the Government is determined to deal with the problems arising in this area urgently and in a very thorough and comprehensive manner.  Action is already under way in several areas and necessary legislation is in the course of being drafted.  The Law Reform Commission has indicated it will publish, within the next few weeks, its report on multi-unit developments.  This report, which follows extensive consultation, will contain definitive reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies.  The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the commission's recommendations.  The types of action to be taken will be dependent on the form the recommendations take.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">A high-level interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of my Department and comprising representatives of relevant Departments and offices, has already met on a regular basis to review the issues that were raised in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper.  The committee will be examining the commission's final report and a key task of the committee will be to identify the legislative and other actions to be taken and determine a timescale for their implementation.  The committee is reporting to a Cabinet committee whose membership comprises the Attorney General and the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Government is already committed to publishing the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill in this session to regulate property service providers, including property management agents.  The Bill will contain extensive provisions to protect the interests of home owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The main functions of the new authority will be to operate a comprehensive licensing system covering all providers of property services, including property management agents; to set and enforce standards for the grant of licences, for example, educational and training standards and levels of professional indemnity insurance, in addition to standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees; to establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services; to promote increased consumer protection and public awareness of property services in general and the cost to consumers, risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services; and to establish, maintain and administer the compensation fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The legislation will provide that all property management agents providing services for property management companies will be required to be licensed by the authority before providing such services.  Both the company and the staff providing such management services will require a licence to operate.  It will be an offence to provide a property management service without such a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Bill will provide that an application for a licence must be accompanied by references as to the applicant's character and competence as the authority may require; certification by a suitably qualified person that proper financial and control systems are in place for the protection of clients' money; evidence of the availability to the applicant of the required level of professional indemnity insurance; and the prescribed fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The authority will refuse to grant a licence if it is satisfied that an applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a property service, is under 18 years of age, has been adjudicated bankrupt, does not comply with any requirements of the Act or detailed regulations under it, has not furnished the authority with written evidence of there being available to the applicant the prescribed minimum level of professional indemnity insurance, or has not paid the prescribed fee or the prescribed contribution to the compensation fund.  Similar provisions will apply to companies and partnerships.  Licensees will be required to renew their licences on an annual basis and the authority will keep a register of licensees.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">In order to ensure compliance with the legislation, the authority will be empowered to investigate, on the basis of a complaint or on its own initiative, both persons licensed to provide property services and those who may be engaged in providing such services without a licence.  In order effectively to discharge this function, the authority will have extensive powers of investigation including powers to enter premises, to require the provision of information and documents and to require persons to attend before it.  If satisfied that the licensee has been guilty of misconduct or of a contravention of the Act or regulations made under it, the authority will be empowered to revoke the licence or suspend it for a specified period or to issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">In the case of an investigation into the provision of a property service by a person who does not possess an appropriate licence, the authority may seek an injunction from the High Court requiring the person to cease the activities that the authority reasonably believes to be in contravention of the legislation.  A person who is aggrieved by a decision of the authority will be able to lodge an appeal with the property services appeal board that is to be established under the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Further protections provided for in the Bill include a requirement to provide clients with a letter of engagement setting out details of the service to be provided, costs etc.; strict provisions relating to the keeping of client accounts; and the establishment and maintenance by the authority of the compensation fund, to which licensees will be required to make an annual contribution.  The purpose of the fund will be to compensate clients in respect of losses arising from dishonesty on the part of licensees.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The protections of clients of property services providers will also, subject to appropriate modifications, apply in respect of property services provided in the State by persons from other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Pending enactment of the proposed legislation, an implementation group has already been established to assist and advise on practical matters relating to the establishment of the new authority and to prepare for a new licensing system.  The implementation group has recently published a code of practice for auctioneers and estate agents.  This code identifies the key principles and values that should guide day-to-day practice of the industry and sets minimum standards of professional conduct to be expected of service providers.  It also incorporates a complaints system which enables complaints concerning non-compliance with the code to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The code has been sent to all licensed auctioneers and estate agents and they have been requested to sign up to it on a voluntary basis.  I am informed that, to date, approximately 60% of licensed auctioneers and estate agents have signed up to the code.  In addition to those who have already signed up, a number have indicated they are amending their current administrative procedures to enable them to comply fully with the code, at which stage they will agree to be bound by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The implementation group is currently drawing up a code of practice for management agents that it hopes to be in a position to launch in the near future.  The group has compiled and published a public register of licensed auctioneers and estate agents.  This register, which may be viewed on the authority's website, comprises a list of the auctioneers and estate agents licensed by the Revenue Commissioners under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973.  It also indicates those licensees who have voluntarily agreed to be bound by the code of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">In the area of consumer awareness, the implementation group has been working on a consumer information package to promote consumer awareness of the process involved in property transactions, and the nature and levels of service provided by property services providers.  It is hoped this information package will be published shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Another area being addressed by the implementation group is the development of a complaints handling and licensing database.  The complaints handling database will facilitate the handling of complaints in accordance with the enforcement provisions of the code of practice.  While the authority will have no licensing function prior to the commencement of the legislation, it is important that it be in place well in advance of the authority being established on a statutory basis so as to ensure a smooth transition to the new licensing regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The great value of the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper has been the overview it provides and the detailed consideration it gives to the problems associated with ownership of apartments and their service and management as a complex of various interests.  The consultation paper stresses the cross-cutting nature of the issues arising in this regard and the need for the Government to address them in a comprehensive and joined-up manner.  This already has been acknowledged by Members opposite.  Clearly this will require action across a number of important policy areas, including the planning and development code, company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">For this reason, to coincide with publication of the consultation paper, the Government established a high level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive Government programme of action on this matter.  A key task of this committee will be to ensure that legislative and other actions are taken in response to the commission's reform recommendations and to determine a timescale for their implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Action continues to be taken by Departments and State agencies since publication of the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has produced policy and guidance documents in the planning and housing areas with particular reference to sustainability aspects.  These initiatives specifically target multi-unit living, while others address the broader issues of sustainability, well designed quality housing, as well as proper social, community and transport networks which, while relevant to all housing forms, also have particular relevance to apartment living.  These initiatives address many of the draft recommendations set out in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Members will be aware that an aspect of multi-unit developments that has come in for much comment in recent years has been the taking in charge of estates by local authorities.  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 places a legal obligation on planning authorities to take in charge residential developments, finished or unfinished, where certain conditions have been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">A new policy guidance regarding the issue of responsibility for the maintenance of common shared facilities in residential estates including small open spaces, car parking and playgrounds, as well as the issue of the completion of estates and the taking in charge process, was issued by way of a departmental circular to all planning authorities in February 2008.  The new guidance document is based on the outcome of the deliberations of a working group established by that Department in August 2006.  The group comprised representatives of the Department, local authorities, architects, planners, the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA, and the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and its task was to consider issues pertaining to taking in charge and property management companies.  This policy advice is based on the outcome of the deliberations of that group.  All planning authorities are now required to develop or update, as appropriate, their policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 on the basis of the framework and the wider housing and planning policy guidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The core principles underpinning the framework for taking in charge, which must be reflected in each local authority policy on this matter, are — a statement of the facilities that will be taken in charge and the maintenance services that will be provided; the issue of taking in charge must be addressed at the pre-planning stage with the approved design facilitating the taking in charge of core facilities; the planning authority's construction and design standards for residential areas will be set out; developers will be required, through the development management process or permission, to complete residential developments to a standard that is in compliance with the planning permission granted; planning authorities must take all necessary measures in this regard in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and enforcement action when necessary; and the procedures for taking in charge will begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Protocols, including timeframes, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge.  In the case of core facilities in existing residential developments that were approved by the planning authority on the basis they would remain private and be maintained by a management company, these must be taken in charge if the majority of residents request it.  The guidance document makes it clear that planning authorities must not attach the establishment of property management companies as a condition of planning in respect of traditional housing estates, save in very exceptional circumstances, such as to maintain a specific facility in that estate which is for residents' use only, such as a private playground, or in the case of holiday homes.  In addition, planning authorities should only attach planning conditions requiring management arrangements regarding certain shared facilities in the newer type of mixed residential development in limited circumstances.  In respect of older estates, priority must continue to be placed on resolving those estates that have been left unfinished or not taken in charge for the longest period.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">As for the monitoring and review of the process, a planning authority's policy on taking in charge is to be made available to the public and published on its website and should continue to be reported on to the elected members on a regular basis and at least once annually.  As part of the overall review and update of the local government service indicators, a new indicator in respect of taking in charge is being introduced from 2008 onwards.  This will provide benchmark data in 2009 for monitoring the taking in charge process and, in particular, the priority being accorded by individual authorities to the taking in charge of unfinished or legacy estates.  This information will allow the Department to review the ongoing work of planning authorities in this regard and will help determine whether additional policy advice on this matter is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Government acknowledges that the owners of units in multi-unit developments need to get clear information on their rights and responsibilities as members of property management companies.  Improved awareness of their rights and an understanding of the corresponding duties and responsibilities of developers and builders will encourage apartment owners to assert their rights as company members become involved in the management of their company and combat abuses and sharp practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">There have been developments in another area since the publication of the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper.  The National Consumer Agency has published a report entitled, Management Fees and Service Charges Levied on Owners of Property in Multi-Unit Dwellings.  The report examined the sector and made some recommendations on the regulation of the sector, service charges and sinking funds, management companies and management agents.  Following the publication of this report, the NCA established a stakeholders' forum to examine the possibility of developing non-legislative voluntary processes, which would be of benefit to consumers.  A number of outputs from the forum are expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The NCA has been working with the Irish Home Builders Association to agree a code of practice in respect of multi-unit developments.  Its scope relates to the construction, completion, marketing and sale and purchase of such units and, in particular, to the management and maintenance of common areas and facilities, as well as to the provision of common services.  This includes issues such as the calculation of service charges, transfer of the management company from the developer to the owners, agreements with management agents etc.  As the NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in this regard, the code will operate on a voluntary basis.  The NCA will, however, monitor the code of practice and revisit it as appropriate over time.  I understand that a preliminary version of the code was approved by IHBA members in March 2008.  A final version is before the IHBA at present and a definitive decision on its content and implementation is expected early this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The NCA, through the work of the multi-unit developments stakeholder forum, has developed a checklist of proposed standard headings to be considered for inclusion in written contracts between management companies and property management agents.  This document has been approved by the forum and will form one of the outputs when the work of the forum is published this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The NCA also has been working on the development of education and training material to assist consumers to better understand multi-unit development living from both a legal and practical perspective.  In particular, the NCA has furthered the development of an e-learning initiative for prospective apartment purchasers.  The initiative will involve training and information on all aspects of the owner-occupiers role in property management companies, building on information previously provided in the NCA booklet, Property Management Companies and You.  The NCA is working closely with Dublin City Council, which will be co-funding and piloting the e-learning initiative in early 2008 with its affordable housing purchasers.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has published a draft guidance document on apartment owners' management companies.  The intention of the document is to support directors and members in the effective running of their management company's affairs and in protecting the valuable assets which comprise most apartment developments.  The document seeks to explain the separate roles of the management company, that is, as the owner of a complex's common areas and as the party responsible for its upkeep, and the management agent, who is contracted by the management company to provide the required building maintenance, insurance, security and other services.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Reference is made to the three phases of a management company life cycle, namely, the developer-only, developer and members and members-only phases.  Following a period of consultation, it is expected the completed guidance document will be published this year.   In 2007, the Government published a policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, which emphasised the need to improve the quality of the built form and placed a focus on building sustainable communities.  In the same year, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published best practice housing guidelines to provide a practical and valuable tool for local authorities, housing associations and private sector clients when formulating the design requirements for housing.  Last year, the Department published development plan guidelines which were designed to improve the quality and consistency of local authority development plans, strengthen their strategic content and improve the building of consensus in the preparation, implementation and review of such plans.  Development management guidelines which address the processing of planning applications from pre-application consultation to the enforcement of planning decisions were also published.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The design standards for new apartments were issued in September 2007.  The primary aim of the standards is to promote sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the overall design and layout of new apartments will provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes, including families with children, over the medium to long term.  Recommended minimum standards are set for, <i>inter alia</i>, floor areas, storage spaces, sizes of balconies and patios and room dimensions.  The new draft planning guidelines on sustainable residential development in urban areas, which were published in February 2008, will act as a blueprint for future sustainable development of Irish cities, towns and villages.  The guidelines, which are accompanied by a best practice urban design manual, focus on more suitable and better accommodation for families, higher quality urban design, high standards of environmental quality and energy efficiency and a focus on locations that capitalise on future transport plans.  It is hoped that they will deliver more sustainable communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is making progress with the developing areas initiative with the aim of seamlessly delivering infrastructure and services in a coherent manner.  The initial focus of the initiative is on quickly growing areas within the national spatial strategy's gateways and hubs.  The Department is working in consultation with local authorities to identify and resolve the blockages in respect of infrastructure and service delivery in each of the strategic locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The Government has approved the drafting of a companies consolidation and reform Bill along the lines of the general scheme prepared by the Company Law Review Group.  The philosophy underpinning the proposals in the general scheme is to simplify company law for the benefit of all stakeholders in company law, including shareholders, members, small privately owned companies, business operators and company law practitioners.  The Bill will enhance the competitiveness of the economy by streamlining and simplifying the companies code.  Company law provides a choice of models by which companies in general, including property management companies, can be incorporated.  This choice is not made by the purchasers of units in the development, but by the developer at an early stage of the development process.  Property management companies own the freehold of the common areas and the freehold reversion in each unit acquired under a long lease by an individual owner.  They have the responsibilities of landlords in enforcing covenants in the leases.  They must manage the complex on an ongoing basis, usually by means of a contract with a separate property management agent.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The general scheme of the proposed Bill contains a number of provisions with the express intention of facilitating the use of the company structure by multi-unit developments.  It is proposed that the membership limit of 99 which will ordinarily apply to the most common company type — the private company limited by shares — will not apply in the case of a residential management company.  Membership of a residential management company will be deemed to transfer from the vendor to the purchaser upon the sale of the underlying property to which the membership relates.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">It is important that proposals to change company law to refer specifically to property management companies reflect the voluntary nature of the role of the director in property management companies.  Such proposals should also reflect the fact that owners of units in a multi-unit development who comprise the company, and from whose ranks directors are necessarily drawn, may have little or no experience of running a company or complying with the formal requirements of company law.  This has to be taken into account also in developing any new company models for such entities and devising future reporting arrangements.  The current strike-off provisions, which are designed to penalise commercial trading companies that do not comply with company law requirements, and which may lead to a company's dissolution and the vesting of its assets in the Minister for Finance, are ill-suited to the operation of property management companies.  Having said that, I feel that if the strike-off provisions are discontinued for property management companies, they will need to be replaced with more suitable provisions.  This is one of the aspects which needs to be addressed further in the ongoing company law reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I acknowledge that there is a widespread lack of understanding about the calculation and payment of management fees and service charges.  Owners of apartments need to be made aware of the purpose of such payments and their responsibilities with regard to the payment of such fees.  They should be aware that the maintenance of the common areas and the fabric of the buildings helps to underpin the value of their property.  The work of the National Consumer Agency's stakeholder forum on multi-unit developments in respect of education and training resources for prospective purchasers in multi-unit developments should prove particularly beneficial in this regard.  The outputs of the stakeholder forum will include sample lists of the costs and services typically covered by a service charge or a sinking fund.  This indicative list should help consumers to understand what is the responsibility of the management company and what falls within the remit of individual unit owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I am conscious that there appears to be a lack of knowledge among owners of units within multi-unit developments about sinking funds.  Pending the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, I am leaning towards the view that there is an absolute need to make the establishment and maintenance of sinking funds by property management companies mandatory.  Owners need to be aware that non-payment of service fees and the absence of a sinking fund will, over time, reduce the value of their property and investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">As I said at the outset, the issue of multi-unit developments is a complex one.  Those who have read the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper will acknowledge that this is a statement of fact rather than opinion.  Issues pertaining to such developments relate to many aspects of legislation, including the planning and development code, company law and consumer protection.  The complexity of these problems highlights the requirement for the Government to address them in a comprehensive and joined-up manner.  This is the approach which the Government has adopted and will follow.  It is not true to say, as was implied in the original motion, that the Government is complacent about this issue.  I do not want the House to divide on this matter.  The Government is not complacent.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I have outlined in detail the substantial amount of work that has been done in this regard by various Departments and State agencies.  Further work will be taken on foot of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations.  The commission has made progress with its final deliberations on the basis of intensive consultation and examination of the issues.  The Government has never attempted to pre-empt that important process and I would like to think Fine Gael would not like us to do so.  We will build on the actions the commission has already taken.  We will take on board, as far as possible, the imminent recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The Government will also take into account the views expressed by Deputies in the House today.  While I commend the Government amendment to the House, I do not believe we should divide on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I thank Deputy Hogan and his Fine Gael colleagues for bringing this motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I would like to remind the House of what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said in response to the then Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, on 14 June 2006:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_415">The only way in which Government can control this situation and set guidelines is to examine the legislative process if local authorities cannot take control of the situation.  I do not understand why local authorities give planning permission that permits management companies in residential housing areas.  Why should it be a condition of planning permission that a management company looks after 30 or 40 houses?  I do not see why that should be a condition of planning permission.  Management companies were never regarded as desirable or essential for residential housing estates.  Management companies in housing estates represent an unnecessary cost unless residents wish that they are established, and that is a decision to be made when people are living in their houses rather than beforehand.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">That was almost two years ago.  There is a management company crisis in this country.  As the Fine Gael motion clearly states, with almost half a million people living in over 300,000 apartments, there has been a long-standing issue of neglect of this matter by the Government.  What is the purpose of management companies and who should be their chief beneficiaries?  Management companies are clearly not needed for housing estates and while they do serve a function for apartment owners, the absence of legislation has led to the creation of a rogue's charter with residents being ripped off and finding themselves subject to management company charges indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">At present, we have a service industry that is totally unregulated and charging almost €1,000 per year for a house and up to €2,000 per year for an apartment.  We should have an end to management companies in private housing estates and a strictly regulated situation for apartments.  To date, there has been a total dereliction of duty by Government on this matter and a clear absence of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The current cosy arrangement allows both the Government and local authorities to wash their hands of their responsibilities while at the same time placing wads of cash in the hands of management companies from households that are already overstretched by mortgage and child care payments.  Such costs are set to continue indefinitely into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">We hear much about local government reform.  If one thing needs to be reformed in this area, however, it is the notion that county and city managers can wash their hands of responsibility for the people who live in their local authority areas by using this clause to introduce rates by the back door.  Local authorities should not be allowed to renege on such responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">For some time, Labour has been proposing a policy directive under section 9 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requiring planning authorities to insist that all new housing developments are designed, constructed and completed to taking-in-charge standards.  Such a policy directive would also require local authorities to issue new planning guidelines for management companies specifying the limited circumstances where such companies may be permitted in the case of apartments.  In respect of such permission, services should be set down, including, where possible, all roads, public open spaces, public lighting and water and sewerage services, which should be completed prior to the taking-in-charge standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Minister indicated earlier that he may support such a move, which is welcome.  Up to now, however, the Government has been inactive on the issue.  It has an appalling record in this regard.  As other speakers have said, the Labour Party introduced a Private Members' motion on this matter in November 2005.  The previous Taoiseach referred to it in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">We have an issue of governance whereby people are paying fees without getting a service.  The Minister may make worthy statements but there is a lack of action.  We need to hear something by which we can measure the action the Government proposes to take.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_423">A similar motion on the regulation and control of management companies was tabled by the Labour Party in November 2005.  It was debated and defeated by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  The Government's 2005 amendment, which was passed, was almost identical to the one tabled today.  At that time, we had the full support of the Green Party.  Now, however, the leader of that party, having been assumed body and soul into the Fianna Fáil Party and its ethos on the building industry, is shamelessly supporting a carbon copy of the amendment he opposed so strongly before he joined Fianna Fáil in all but name.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Since that Labour Party motion was debated some two and a half years ago, no promised legislation, instructions or guidelines have seen the light of day.  Government Ministers have been sitting on their hands regarding this issue because Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Greens, who accept everything, do not want to upset their friends in the building industry.  They never upset their paymasters who have made a fat killing on the backs of young families to whom they sold houses at inflated prices.  Their greed knows no bounds and the magic management companies provided the icing on the cake for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">However, the rot did not start in 2005 at the time of the Labour Party's motion, but with the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Planning and Development Act 2000.  That legislation enabled county managers to impose a planning condition that a management company be established and that it be registered as a lien on the title of each property.  That literally gave developers a blank cheque that they drew down from the accounts of young families struggling with already massive mortgage repayments.  Management companies sprang up like mushrooms not just for apartment blocks or mixed housing estates, but also for standard housing.  They did so without regulation or control.  They became a new milch cow for already fat cat developers.  Without regulation or control, they could force householders to pick up the tab for services that were clearly the developer's legal responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In my constituency, some 4,000 housing units are now covered by management companies.  They are paid on average €1,200 per year, effectively to the developer.  The vast majority of these, some 3,200, are standard houses with absolutely no need for a management company.  The only benefit they gain from this developer's bonanza is that the grass is cut, but they are also picking up the tab for the ongoing liability of the developer for water, sewerage, roads, paths, lights and open space.  In my constituency alone, I calculate that homeowners and tenants are paying some €4.6 million per year into the already well-lined pockets of developers.  These families live in houses in Kill, Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth, Sallins, Kilcock and Straffan.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Labour Party demands that action be taken to end this rip off of young families.  Where management systems are required in apartment blocks, they should be controlled by legally binding regulations.  They should also be organised on a co-operative basis.  In all cases affecting standard houses, these rip-off companies should be abolished and clear title restored to the home owners concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">Like my colleagues, I welcome the Fine Gael Private Members' motion, which is similar to a previous motion on this issue tabled by the Labour Party.  There is a political issue at the core of the Government's refusal to legislate for management companies.  Thousands of young home owners and a smaller number of older home owners who downsize to apartment complexes face frustrations by being charged — certainly in Dublin West — an average of €2,000 to €3,000 per year for very poor services.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The political issue arises from the fact that Fianna Fáil is in hock to vested interests in the building industry, including developers.  Those vested interests constitute a permanent stain on the character of the Government, which was previously led by Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The refreshed Government, formed by the new Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, seems unwilling to address the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I wish the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, well in his new portfolio.  As I am sure he is aware, in the Drogheda area of his own constituency, many thousands of people are caught up in this management company trap.  In my own constituency — in Castleknock, Mulhuddart, Clonsilla and Blanchardstown — management companies have spread like a rash among new developments.  This is the case both in apartment blocks, where management companies are essential to manage common areas, but also in ordinary housing developments where people are essentially being charged up to €600 per year to have a small lawn and three shrubs at the front of their house cut by a developer.  Many people living in large developments do not object if the location is kept clean and tidy and they receive value for money from such services.  The residents may be busy commuters.  From the places Deputy Emmet Stagg and I represent, it is often a commute of an hour and a half to work in Dublin.  For good services, therefore, people might be prepared to pay fees.  However, many young couples who have just got started on the housing ladder are being fleeced by the management companies and management agents.  There is no proper invoicing and no indication of what services are being paid for by the management company.  In some cases, the local authority is also providing some of the services for free, such as public lighting, yet residents are paying on the double.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Government apparently established an interdepartmental committee on this issue but nothing has emerged from it.  I am glad that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has arrived in the Chamber.  The Green Party has many good objectives in Government, which I share, but if that party is unwilling to address the vested interests that have Fianna Fáil tied hand in glove to developers and builders, who have made tens of millions of euro in speculation on the backs of young people buying into management companies, it is difficult to understand why it is in Government other than to enjoy the vicarious pleasure of holding office.  The previous Taoiseach told me no fewer than five times in this House that he considered it scandalous that young people were being ripped off in this way by management companies.  However, that was all talk.  There is now a new Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is restored to his old Department but there has not even been a mouse-like roar from the parties indicating that they will take action.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Indeed, I am one of the Deputies mentioned by my colleagues who spoke on this issue in 2005.  The situation has not moved forward by even a centimetre in the meantime.  Deputy Burton is correct that the people who are suffering as a result of the failure to provide adequate legislation in this area are young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I wish to focus on apartment blocks.  My constituency of Dublin South-Central is awash with apartments, from Park West through Drimnagh, Crumlin and Walkinstown and into Cork Street and the inner city.  All one sees in the constituency are patches of land for which planning permission is being sought or high rise apartments.  To confuse matters further, there are new proposals for maximising the city's potential from Dublin City Council which envisage further high rise blocks.  We might need more development but the proposals mean more high rise apartments, more management agents and companies and more ripping off of the unfortunate owners of those apartments.  There is a great deal of fudge and lack of clarity surrounding the issue of management agents and management companies.  The owner of an apartment is often at a complete loss as to who has responsibility for what.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">One issue that will become important, and Deputy Ciarán Lynch has mentioned it on a number of occasions, is where local government will allow tenants to purchase their flats.  In due course the issue of overall management will have to be addressed.  Who will address the issue in that case?  Who has responsibility?  What management agency and management company will be in place?  Will there be more of the same, whereby the fat cats that were mentioned earlier will avail of the system?</p>
          <p eId="para_435">When I last spoke in the House on this issue, I put forward a number of proposals that could be addressed and that could bring clarity to the situation.  I proposed, for example, that a condition be imposed on developers to complete the apartment complex satisfactorily within a specified period.  That condition exists when a development consists of two or more houses so why should it not apply to apartments as well?  I also proposed that as soon as an apartment development is completed satisfactorily, ownership of the common parts must be handed over immediately to a management company.  A number of speakers have mentioned the problem of those areas staying, in effect, under the control of the developer, effectively disenfranchising the owners of the apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Developers should not be allowed to maintain prolonged control of apartment complex management companies.  In Britain, where there is a longer history of the management of apartments, there is a relatively straightforward simple solution in place.  It is a solution that could be put in place here.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I will briefly outline the situation of one of my constituents, who is a member of a management company and lives in an apartment.  It is indicative of the problem faced by many other people when there is no legislation in place to regulate this area and they cannot go the National Property Services Regulatory Authority to advise it or mediate the issue on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">My constituent has lived in a small apartment in west Dublin for over two years and has been sent numerous bills by the managing agent.  It appears that after two years the constituent owes approximately €6,500.  He has raised numerous problems with the service being provided by the managing agent.  The lifts were out of order for six months, carpets that were ripped were not repaired, broken light fittings have not been fixed and rubbish such as refrigerators dumped in the stairwells has not been removed.  He took photographs to show me and to bring to court.  The state of the common areas was appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">He was eventually summonsed to go to court by the management company.  He initially brought a solicitor with him to court, at a cost of €600.  However, the legal team for the management company did not turn up and the case was struck out.  He was then summonsed again for the same amount.  On that occasion he tried to defend himself.  He brought the photographs and listed the services that had not been provided but, unfortunately, the judge found against him.  He intends to appeal the case.  He subsequently received another summons for almost €5,000.  If there is another judgment against him, he will owe approximately €7,000 and will possibly have to pay legal costs as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">My constituent is trying to defend himself as best he can but he does not have the ability to do so.  He did not have the ability to persuade the judge.  I practised as a solicitor and I knew when I looked at the photographs and material he showed me that he had not received the service for which he is being charged.  That should have been taken into account in the court decision.  The problem is that he is not experienced and he is up against the big legal team of the management company or management agent — they are more or less the same.  He is unable to defend himself.  I believe many people will not even try to defend themselves and will have judgments registered against them.  Some people will pay the charges even though they are being charged unfair amounts and are not receiving the services.  Those who do not pay will have judgments and judgment mortgages registered against them for amounts of approximately €7,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Many of the people concerned bought so-called affordable housing units, which turned out to be apartments or houses in managed complexes.  They are not well off and can barely pay their mortgages, let alone the exorbitant management fees.  They cannot afford legal costs and have nowhere to turn.  They approach their local representatives but we cannot help them either because the situation is a mess.  I have been in contact with the National Property Services Regulatory Authority and I suggested to another constituent that he write to the authority to see if it could help him, but the authority replied that it could not because there is no legal basis for it to deal with people who are members of management companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We do not need large complicated reports; there are plenty of them.  The Minister need only copy the Private Residential Tenancies Board legislation and substitute the National Property Services Regulatory Authority for the board.  This will give the authority the legal standing to meet with clients and mediate on their behalf.  The Minister can put other legislation in place afterwards.  It is not a complicated matter.  If there was a means whereby people could negotiate and mediate, they would at least not get fleeced and there might be a possibility of compromise, with reasonable management fees and a better service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_443">I welcome the Private Members' motion put forward by Fine Gael.  I wish to comment on the Government's proposed amendment to the motion.  This is an area which requires legislation.  We should be critical of developers, speculators and the private management companies that are ripping off people living in apartment blocks.  None of that is reflected in the amendment.  I urge Deputies to vote in favour of the Sinn Féin amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The amendment includes much of what the Fine Gael motion contained and adds to it.  Good housing is one of the most important elements of a healthy society.  It is crucial to have proper regulated housing and in particular regulated management companies.  Such regulation should be part of a robust tenant protection regime.  We have long advocated the introduction of this legislation, which would provide that.  Irish republicans have always believed the ability to rent one's home under fair conditions, with fixity of tenure or outright ownership to be a social good and part of the birthright of Irish people.  From the just demands of the 19th century Land League and the 20th century civil rights movement, housing rights have been the touchstone of our struggle for generations, and will remain so into the 21st century.  Combating the scourge of management companies is an extension of this struggle.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">We recognise it is necessary to have management bodies in blocks of flats and apartments.  However, Sinn Féin is opposed to the involvement of private for-profit management companies in the maintenance of roads and common open space, which in traditional housing estates have normally been the responsibility of local government.  Such services should be paid for through direct progressive taxation.  The main problem with private management companies is that they impose a form of double taxation through the imposition of fees and therefore are a stealth tax.  It is fundamentally inequitable that some residents pay for a service, while their neighbours receive it free of charge.  For-profit management companies should not be allowed to extort thousands of euro from people in housing estates towards the upkeep of an area and the provision of essential services when these should be the responsibility of local authorities.  All public areas should be in the care of local authorities and never outsourced to private management.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">At present, although they are subject to company law, such private estate management companies are unregulated and company law does not adequately serve to prevent the unethical practices they are engaged in.  Many specific problems are associated with their proliferation in the Twenty-six Counties, in particular the virtual entire lack of accountability to the residents who pay for their services, as well as the fact that the fees charged are often exorbitant and subject to enormous increases.  I have heard of increases of up to 300% in a single year, without any corresponding improvement in service, which is nothing short of a licence to print money.  This cannot be allowed to continue. Tenants should be able to participate directly in the running of not-for-profit management companies, co-operatives or whatever — there are many models to follow.  Local authority funding should be provided to foster community engagement projects in the running and co-operation of estate management.  The current situation leaves no room for tenant participation, when management or landlords control the voting procedures.  It is disgracefully unfair that a company can increase its fees and ensure grave hardship for those who have to pay them.  Furthermore, it is disgracefully unfair when a management company can charge exorbitant fees and not even provide the services for which tenants are paying.  We saw an example in Tyrellstown, Dublin 15, when tenants were left for years without a suitable water tower as the service was being run by a private management company.  To add insult to injury, while the supply was inadequately managed, the water became contaminated with e.coli.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">A form of management company is unavoidable for some apartment blocks, but in the event, such companies should be run on a not-for-profit basis and cover only structural insurance, internal communal areas and walled gardens.  The Government must implement legislation to ensure that these fees are not then foisted upon the tenant when the development is incomplete.  He or she should not have to shoulder the construction costs for the developers, as has been the case in some instances.  It is imperative that legislation is introduced to regulate such companies as company law is clearly not enough.  They are unregulated entities to which tenants are forced to buy into since they have no other legal option.  In the Bructailt estate, in Nenagh, County Tipperary, residents who had no part of the management company, were faced with solicitors' letters when they tried to take action to extract themselves from their present situation.  In Castlecurragh, Blanchardstown, in 2006 a management company was established by Fingal County Council in which both of its directors were employees of the company.  This company then proceeded to charge a legal fee of €25 per household for the sole purpose of prosecuting local residents.  This came about after one resident had successfully won a case against the management company.  As the company wished to appeal the decision to a higher court, it proceeded to charge the legal costs to the residents.  That is a disgrace and meant the residents were effectively paying the company to sue themselves.  This is a farcical scenario, but just one of many such examples.  The onus is on the Government to urgently introduce legislation that will combat all such unjust situations, not just some.  Builders and developers regularly fail to complete the work on housing developments — mainly footpaths, road surfacing, road markings, drainage, landscaping, builders' rubble and waste disposal.  There are quite a number of other examples of where such companies and developers have neglected to complete the work, as they should have.  The money given in service and management charges is often unaccounted for — this is the biggest disgrace — in terms of how it is spent.  Tenants frequently ask questions such as whether the gates were fixed, why the lift was inoperable for months on end, if the wall was painted and the rubble collected.  Many residents ask such questions but do not get the answers from the management companies.  Costs need to be more transparent so that the already cash-strapped home owner knows that he or she is not being ripped off.  That is a reasonable demand for anybody to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Housing policy in Ireland has, for a very long time, been fundamentally inequitable and unbalanced in a number of respects, and that needs to change.  This is one of the ways in which that change can be brought about.  The number of elements contained in the Sinn Féin amendment improve on the Fine Gael motion, and I welcome that.  There has been an overemphasis on the financial gains to be made from housing at the expense of social housing, which is central to the well-being of the nation.  The private property speculator, the developer and the rental sectors are being enormously subsidised by the State at taxpayers' expense.  More people are being driven into the hands of management companies and the people behind them, many of whom are developers who see this as another way to extract more money from those trying to buy their own homes.  The decrease in social and affordable housing is pushing people into the private rental sector where they lack security of tenure or forcing them to dangerously overmortgage or into crowded accommodation with their extended families.  They are then forced to pay astronomical fees to private management companies which sometimes do not even provide the basic services.  The big business management companies, private property speculators and developers once again line their pockets at taxpayers' expense.  The legislation is long overdue and must contain all the elements I have included in the amendment I have proposed to the Government's amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
          <p eId="para_449">The Government is determined to ensure that the public concerns relating to multi-unit developments and property management companies are urgently addressed.  This issue is broad and touches on a wide range of legislative and policy areas and legal documentation, leases and other legal agreements between buyers, sellers and management companies, as well as consumer protection and company law issues.  A targeted study and consultation process has been undertaken by the Law Reform Commission in relation to multi-unit developments and is nearing completion.  An interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was established after the publication of the initial Law Reform Commission consultation paper and includes representation from my Department.  This committee will help to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to the recommendations for legislative reforms.  I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with input from relevant Departments, will progress whatever legislation may be necessary in response to the Law Reform Commission report.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">My Department does not have a central role in the management and maintenance of private apartment schemes or other private accommodation, or the operation or governance of property management companies in private developments.  Our role in this area mainly arises in terms of planning and sustainable housing and a number of significant initiatives are already under way in these areas, providing an overall framework within which the creation of sustainable communities can be achieved.  While these documents are generally relevant to housing in all forms, the underlying theme of sustainability, well designed quality housing, proper social community and transport networks are even more pertinent to modern apartment living.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">A new policy statement of housing policy, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, was launched in February 2007.  The policy statement strongly endorses the vision of better quality housing in sustainable communities, as set out in Towards 2016.  The statement sets out a vision to guide the transformation of the Irish housing sector over the next ten years by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing this in a more strategic way.  It sets out a range of actions geared at building sustainable communities and responding to housing need in a way that improves choice and encourages individual responsibility within communities.  There is a clear emphasis on a services approach, one which tailors supports to households taking account of their position in the lifecycle, effectively delivering housing programmes to get better outcomes for the households supported and better value for money for the taxpayer.  The emphasis following publication has been on implementation of the reform agenda set out in the statement.  This has involved consultation with stakeholders, developing the detail of schemes and progressing the drafting of legislation to reflect the social housing reform agenda set out in the policy statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">In March 2007, my Department launched new design guidelines on housing delivery entitled Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities.  This was followed in September 2007 by new design standards for apartments, which aim to promote good living environments which can support successful apartment living, particularly in terms of better internal space standards, including storage space.  These documents form part of a suite of guidance documents which my Department is developing to promote quality in housing and neighbourhoods.  I welcome this focus on sustainable communities that meets the diverse needs of existing and future residences that are sensitive to the environment and contribute to a high quality of life.  This is particularly timely and relevant in the context of multi-unit developments where issues of interdependence and the complexities of high density living arise in a more pronounced way.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">In February, I published for public consultation new draft planning guidelines on sustainable residential development in urban areas which update and expand the 1999 residential density guidelines.  The public consultation period on the draft guidelines closed earlier this week and the comments and submissions received will now be fully considered with a view to finalising the guidelines later this year.  The new guidelines are accompanied by a best practice urban design manual.  The proposals involve setting high standards in terms of space and facilities, which will help achieve the most efficient use of urban land through housing densities that are appropriate to the location involved and the availability of supporting services and infrastructure, particularly transport services.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Intrinsically linked to the strategic planning of sustainable communities is the co-ordinated delivery of the necessary infrastructure and services in those strategic locations currently under development pressure.  New developments need to be more than just the provision of houses.  It is essential that schools, community facilities, employment, transport and amenities are integrated with the housing development process in a timely, cost-effective and sustainable manner.  Key infrastructure such as roads, water and wastewater services should anticipate rather than follow the delivery of new housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">A Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was mandated to take responsibility for driving this developing areas initiative.  A dedicated unit has been established in my Department to work with the local authorities and delivery agencies in resolving blockages and providing a coherent approach to servicing and releasing these lands for development.  I congratulate Deputy Batt O'Keeffe on his elevation to higher office as Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Last December, as a further step in improving quality in housing, I introduced building regulations for new dwellings, including new multi-unit developments.  The regulations, which meet in full the 2007 commitment in the programme for Government in this area, are intended to achieve a 40% reduction in energy consumption and a 40% reduction in related CO2 emissions from 1 July next.  These new measures were the start of a whole new dynamic which I intend to bring to bear on the energy efficiency of our dwellings over time.  My proposals are as follows.  I will review the building regulations again in 2010 with a view to a 60% improvement over the 2005 standards for new dwellings.  As a natural evolution of this process and as stated in the recently published Statement of Strategy 2008-2010 of my Department, my aim is to achieve zero carbon emissions associated with the development of dwellings and buildings in general at the earliest date practicable.  As part of this process, I will invite local authorities, building on the experiences of the House of Tomorrow initiative, to submit proposals for a number of targeted and focused demonstration projects within their housing programmes, aiming towards zero carbon housing and based on criteria to be issued by my Department.  I will work closely with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the roll-out of the building energy rating system for all dwellings and in developing strategies for the retrofitting of existing dwellings.  In my direct area of responsibility, I intend to reinforce a strong energy efficiency component in ongoing programmes of refurbishment and upgrading works of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The energy area is also directly connected to the issue of the management of multi-unit development as greater efficiencies are available both in capital and operational terms when energy services are managed on a shared or collective basis.  Group heating systems can be matched with combined heat and power and with renewable energy to bring about major energy savings in energy costs for residents and greenhouse gas emissions.  The recommendations being developed by the interdepartmental committee I referred to earlier will take account of the need to ensure that the legal framework for management of multi-unit developments facilitates and encourages energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I wish to refer to the matter of responsibility for shared facilities in residential estates, including high density estates comprising a mix of houses and apartments.  In February last my Department issued policy guidance to planning authorities asking them to adopt or update policies on the taking in charge of estates, which will include the following essential elements.  Certain core facilities, namely, public roads and footpaths, public lighting, public water supply and sewerage, public open spaces and unallocated surface parking areas will generally be taken in charge and then maintained by the planning authority.  The issue of taking in charge must be addressed at the pre-planning stage and the developer must identify clearly on the planning drawings the areas that will be taken in charge.  Developers will be required, through the development management process permission, to complete residential developments to a standard that is in compliance with the planning permission granted.  Planning authorities must take all necessary measures in this regard, in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and enforcement action when necessary.  The procedures for taking in charge must begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including timeframes, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Where there are core facilities in existing residential developments which were approved by the planning authority on the basis that they would remain private and be maintained by a management company, these must be taken in charge if the majority of residents request it.  Planning authorities must not include management companies as a condition of planning in respect of traditional housing estates, save in very exceptional circumstances.  Planning authorities should only attach planning conditions requiring management arrangements in high density estates in limited circumstances.  Such cases would include requiring management to maintain the exterior and shared internal areas of multi-unit structures, as has traditionally been the case.  Also, management arrangements might be considered necessary to maintain certain shared external facilities that will not be taken in charge, for example, highly landscaped open spaces or allocated car-parking.  As these facilities have effectively replaced what were the owners' private gardens in the traditional housing estate, it is considered reasonable that the residents should maintain them.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Implementation of this policy will, effectively, mean that residents in high-density estates that include multi-unit structures will be on the same footing as residents in traditional housing estates regarding the facilities that will be taken in charge by the planning authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">These guidelines and strategies make a valuable and relevant contribution to the creation of sustainable communities, where people can and want to live and work.  I will ensure that my Department will continue to deliver on its remit in this area.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and wish him well in the new Government.  I am glad to note the Minister's interest in this subject.  I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago on it and I sensed his particular interest.  As other colleagues have said, he knows this is an issue that affects us all across the political scene.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I also wish the new Government well and congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  I make particular reference to Deputies Tom Kitt and Séamus Brennan because they share a constituency boundary with me and previously represented parts of Dublin South-West that I represent along with Deputies Brian Hayes, Pat Rabbitte and Conor Lenihan.  I pay tribute to both Deputies and wish them well.  I will continue, along with other colleagues, to represent their former constituents in what is now Dublin South-West.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I applaud the appointment of Deputy Dermot Ahern as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I wish him well.  I listened carefully from the Chair to his speech this morning and was impressed by his grasp of the issue, as were my colleagues in the House, including, I think, those on the Fine Gael side.  It is important that this is an issue for all of us, not just those on the Opposition benches.  I represent Dublin South-West and this is an issue throughout my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">In recent years Dublin South-West, particularly the Tallaght region, has changed as far as units of accommodation are concerned.  There are far more apartments now than there were five or six years ago throughout Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills and this has presented particular challenges.  Even politicians cannot get access anymore.  If Deputy Hayes has cracked how to gain entry to apartments he might share the information with me.  I will be happy to co-operate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_467">This is an issue but of greater gravity are the challenges facing those living in apartment blocks.  We in Tallaght have received much contact from Marlfield, Deerpark and around the Belgard Square area.  We recently objected to more apartments being built in Tallaght and South Dublin County Council's planning application for the old Esso site in Tallaght village.  Like other colleagues, I am disappointed there are to be more apartments in Tallaght village because this presents a particular challenge for my community.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I am not copying Deputy Terence Flanagan but I wish to refer to a cutting from the <i>Tallaght Echo</i>, which I read every week.  There is a great picture of Deputy Hayes in it this week, in case anyone would like to see it.  The Deputy is getting good publicity.  “Residents refuse to pay hiked management fees”, screamed a headline last week.  This illustrates that this an issue throughout all constituencies, as my colleagues have said.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_469">A group of residents in an apartment block in Tallaght are refusing to pay management fees because of what they see as an unacceptable increase in last year's bill.  The <i>Echo </i>spoke to several residents from the Loftus Hall apartment block in Belgard Square who say they cannot afford to pay the management fees, which, they claim, have gone up by over €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">This highlights the issue that is being presented to us all and I hope Ministers, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will understand the need for proper, effective legislation in this regard as this is something we would all support.  We must put out a positive message that what is happening is not right.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The new Government is working hard and constructively on delivering the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Not far from here, around Grand Canal Dock in Dublin's docklands area, there are many apartments and the area has been transformed.  This has been a good thing and it has transformed people's lives because it has brought about much needed accommodation and housing stock.  There are difficulties associated with living in apartment blocks and they are particularly isolated, in many ways.  They can be separate communities from the wider community, which can lead to tension.  As a public representative, I believe these challenges are not healthy for either political bodies or apartment communities.  This is something we will have to deal with and the Government will address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">There is clearly a problem.  I spoke to a resident in the docklands area who pays over €2,000 in management charges every year; there are 120 apartments in his block which means a significant amount of money is involved.  Management agents are making big money from all of this and in the case I refer to almost a quarter of a million euro to manage a block of apartments seems excessive.  Many agents have neither bonds nor security and there is clearly a problem because often the agent is appointed by the developer and acts on his or her behalf, rather than on behalf of the residents.  When a developer finishes the last apartment, he or she can high tail it away, leaving the place unfinished.  It can be particularly difficult to get them to come back to complete the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Residents are suffering, something needs to be done and the Government is addressing this issue.  The legislative programme published in early April indicates that the issue of multi-dwelling buildings is being prioritised.  The publication of legislation that will establish the National Property Services Regulatory Authority, NPSRA, in this Dáil session is a good thing.  There is no doubt that this issue will be dealt with as it is a matter of urgency.  As Deputy O'Connor suggested, people face severe financial difficulties as a result of management agents charging huge amounts of money.  The NPSRA already has a website that is very informative, helpful and consumer-friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">It is ironic that Fine Gael is calling for a statutory footing for the NPSRA when it has already been agreed that this will happen in this Dáil session and when that party has already expressed concerns at the number of quangos.  Does Fine Gael favour fewer regulatory bodies or more of them?  In my view, the success of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the need for the NPSRA shows that certain agencies can be effective in dealing with management charges.  This will make a substantial difference.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_478">It is no coincidence Members present represent mainly urban constituencies.  Management companies are a problem for new urban areas.  I live in a housing estate which comprises more houses than apartments but has a management company.  It charges €200 a year to essentially cut the grass and insure common areas.  To many this might sound like good value but it is a housing estate where there are no insurance issues and the apartments are treated separately.  There is a serious issue in several apartment developments in my constituency and Drogheda where management fees are very high.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The difficulty for many residents is when they attend their management company's AGM they have little power and cannot get information on tendering processes or how, say, an insurance quote was obtained.  Answers are very often oblique.  I have also noted many AGMs are held deliberately at times that do not suit residents.  For example, in one estate with many young couples an AGM was held on Valentine's night.  In other cases management agents do not want to be hassled to give information on fees.  The proposed property services regulator will play a large role in property management charges, which will be a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Residents have responsibilities themselves.  I have attended several management companies AGMs and noted attendance was poor.  While there are injustices in the system, residents have a duty to get involved as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The strike-off provisions in company law are presenting difficulties for people buying apartments.  I know of one individual who was about to close a deal when he found out the management company for the apartment had been struck off, making it difficult to complete the transaction.  All solicitors acting for purchasers should research management companies on the Companies Registration Office website before contracts are signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">We do not want a system of privatised taxation which is what management companies are.  Where I live, we pay to have the greens cut while in a nearby estate they are cut by the county council.  Insurance is not a matter for residents but for the council.  I accept different estates have different rules, not always depending on when they were built.  Newer housing estates have been exempted from the condition for management companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Residents must know the duties and responsibilities of their management company.  Constituents often contact me about not being able to get through to their management company on, say, moving an abandoned car.  In many cases I cannot tell them if it is their management company's responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The title deeds on apartments are very complicated and contain extraordinary rules as to what residents can do in their apartments.  Most times they are designed for the overall betterment of an estate.  However, some rules serve no purpose and are not known by residents.  Often a management company will enforce them to residents' annoyance.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">The Dublin North constituency has a large number of apartment block developments.  It is essential that in existing developments roads, lights, public open spaces, etc. come under the immediate control of local authorities.  The main problem with management companies is that people feel they are paying charges for services that fall under the remit of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">There must be a clear delineation of the rights and duties of management companies, developers and local authorities.  Often areas are part completed and handed over to a management company.  In one estate I know, confusion exists over which body has responsibility for a playground.  It was a condition of the planning permission for the developer.  However, is it still his responsibility or that of the management company or the local authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I welcome the Government's commitment to publish the property services regulatory authority Bill.  The sooner proper licensing of management agents is introduced, the better. As in any other profession, proper standards are needed and the cowboys that exist in property services need to be routed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I hope the interdepartmental group on property services will complete its report at an early date, allowing the House to consider its recommendations when dealing with legislation on management companies.  The sooner a chief executive officer designate of the proposed property services regulatory authority is appointed, the better.  It will allow us to give clear direction to developers and management companies in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">There is an onus on solicitors to point out to potential apartment purchasers the rules and regulations of management companies.  Often people are not aware they have signed into a management company and its responsibilities.  This must be set out clearly in the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I also suggest that a separate client bank account for management companies be provided for, similar to those used in other professions.  While I am not suggesting management companies are doing anything improper with the fees charged, no one knows where the fees go.  The legislation must provide that the money is locked into a client account.  This is a cross-party issue with no need for point-scoring.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Trying to compile a proper electoral register in apartment blocks is impossible.  Many residents are foreign nationals who may not want to be on the electoral register.  Apart from the difficultly of politicians trying to canvass apartments——</p>

          <p eId="para_498">That the Government has enacted no legislation in this regard is extraordinary.  For 15 years, large apartment blocks have been built in cities.  They spread throughout Dublin city and county.  Limerick, Galway and Cork have experienced this phenomenon, as have other cities and towns to a lesser extent.  They have one factor in common, namely, management companies meant to take care of apartment blocks and to deal with services.  The manner in which this matter has been dealt is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Too frequently and for too long, management companies have been controlled by apartment developers.  They view the companies not as providing a service to those to whom apartments have been sold, but as a means to rip them off.  They fail to provide essential services and when management companies controlled by developers get around to holding annual general meetings, they try to hold them at times and locations that render attendance impossible for 95% or 100% of apartment owners.  The management company of an apartment block called Parkview in Stepaside in my constituency decided to hold its AGM at 7 p.m. on a weekday in a hotel in the city centre, knowing full well that it would be impossible for working residents to attend.  I do not know how many appeared, but I would be surprised if it was more than six.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">That there has been no legislation to date is scandalous.  I have listened to other speakers' comments.  Every Deputy has been the recipient of complaints from people who found themselves helpless when confronted by management companies.  Agents appointed by developers to run management companies become the developers' playthings.  If the developer is involved in a variety of developments, the agent knows he or she will get further fees from running management companies if he or she does what the developer wants.  If the developer does not like what the agent is doing, the agent will be sacked.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">With the exception of those controlled by apartment purchasers, management companies comprise the new feudal landlords of the 21st century and regard themselves as lording it over those who have had the misfortune to purchase apartments without an understanding of how the companies operate.  This past week saw the extraordinary event of a developer advertising new apartments for sale and, to ensure visitors purchased new apartments rather than second-hand apartments, arranging through a management company for notices advertising apartments for resale to be taken down.  The company regarded itself as free to remove the "for sale" signs.  According to the lease terms, the permission of the management company was necessary to erect signs.  On the basis that no one was aware of this requirement, the company sent in a crane and men climbed up it to remove the "for sale" notices.  It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The other matter of concern for which management companies and local authorities bear significant responsibility is that of visitor parking.  I wish to sound a note of caution to anyone intending to buy an apartment anywhere.  The first question should not be about what parking is available to owners, the answer to which will probably be a single parking space.  Rather, the first question should be about visitor parking.  A development of more than 650 apartments in my constituency has only 24 visitor parking spaces.  Local authorities should be conditioning apartment developments to provide sufficient parking to facilitate visiting families and friends.  Some are not doing so on an ideological basis of which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources might approve, namely, to encourage the use of public transport over private transport.  It is a fantastic theory, but it does not work with a lousy public transport system, which might not even exist in some of the areas in question.  Before we adopt an ideological theory in which people will be forced Soviet-style to use public transport, we need a public transport system that will take people to where they want to go.  For example, if one lives in Dundrum, Stillorgan or Rathfarnham, one may not have regular access to a bus service to visit friends or relatives in Stepaside.  The Dublin local authorities — I single out the authority with which I am familiar, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council — have much to answer for in allowing large apartment developments without requiring that parking spaces be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">There is an arrogance on the part of developers who do not tell purchasers about available visitor parking and pretend it will be adequate.  When people buy apartments, they tend to consider the general road infrastructure in the vicinity and presume the availability of a reasonable amount of visitor parking.  The developer does not inform them that, once all the apartments have been sold, double yellow lines will be painted along the road sections not specifically set aside for parking spaces.  This was done by a developer in the Stepaside area.  A passing garda who did not know better gave everyone parked on the double yellow lines tickets.  It took my intervention to discover that the local authority and Garda had not sanctioned the lines — it was a unilateral act on behalf of the developer or management company — and to communicate with the Garda, not just to cancel tickets, but to refund those who had paid.  It is not good enough that people find themselves living in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Having watched the debate on television in my office and read the Ministers' scripts, I am not happy.  The Government has made a series of promises to the effect that it may legislate after the Law Reform Commission publishes its final report.  I know what happens to those reports.  Approximately 50 LRC reports are gathering dust in various departmental offices.  If the drafting of the required legislation has not commenced, the likelihood of the LRC report producing legislation this year or next year is between zero and minus 1,000.  Will the Government explain why no Bills have been drafted and published despite the original consultation paper?  The matter might be complex, but it is not rocket science.  The lives of tens of thousands of people are being diminished.  They paid too much for poorly constructed apartments and local authorities failed to ensure proper conditions were imposed in terms of noise pollution and visitor parking.  The least the Government could do is to provide protection against cowboy management companies controlled by developers diminishing further the value and enjoyment people get from their properties.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_505">In the past five years, I have held five public meetings on this issue in my constituency.  Most of the ordinary people who attended asked the most pertinent question, namely, why is it that their Government, this Dáil and the people they elected to do their bidding have not devised a legislative scheme to place a framework around this legal and political mess.  I could not answer the question because the Government does not know what it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">It has no plan to deal with this issue.  There is no road map to a solution even though the issue first arose on the political agenda about six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Complaints are often made about the appalling situation that pertains to ground rent.  People living in parts of my constituency are supposed to pay an annual rent to absentee landlords who have titles of ownership dating back several hundred years, although many refuse.  Management companies are the modern equivalent of ground rent.  Shame on the Government for allowing this issue to develop under our noses over the past ten years without any political or legal response.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Why do local authorities make it a condition of every application for residential developments that a management company is put in place?  They are continually withdrawing essential basic services from householders.  This problem particularly affects my constituency, where 10% of all households have to pay substantial sums of money to management companies in the complete absence of a legislative framework.  It is a scam from start to finish.  Often, the only way young couples can get a mortgage is over a 30-year term.  Many are faced with negative equity and now they discover they have no control over this new tax levied on them by an unaccountable management company.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Some colleagues have suggested that a way to resolve this is by giving more power to residents to attend meetings and take responsibility.  At a recent public meeting which I organised in an estate in Ballycullen in my constituency, the success of one resident in reducing charges for the year by taking control of the local management company was discussed, but everyone else at the meeting came to the conclusion that they did not want to undergo the hardships involved.  These were working people, with better things to do with their lives than organise management companies or take responsibility for the maintenance of estates.  Those who believe a huge body of ordinary people want to take control of these matters should be warned that a lot of work is involved in rooting out bad companies and replacing them with agents.  Therefore, I caution people about suggesting that the political support exists for such a change.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Much of the responsibility lies with local authorities.  Councillors should demand to know why new applications carry conditions of subservience to management companies.  The issue has to be addressed through legislation.  The Government's response has been pathetic and the new framework announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, gives little confidence to the people who are left in this situation.  Action was needed five years ago and even if new legislation is put in place quickly, it may not have a retrospective effect on existing housing stock.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_511">I support this Fine Gael motion because it highlights the unacceptable situation whereby many people living in apartments and housing developments are burdened with spiralling management fees and receive little in return.  The lack of accountability among property management companies and agents needs to be urgently addressed, particularly in light of the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">In my constituency of Dublin South-Central, apartment complexes have become part of the skyline in recent years.  These apartments have afforded many young people the opportunity to get their feet on the property ladder.  The affordable housing scheme has also enabled young people to purchase apartments in the city which they might otherwise not have been able to afford.  At present, 8,500 people are on Dublin City Council's affordable housing list.  However, the council has suspended this list because demand exceeds supply and people who have managed to buy under the scheme are faced with rapidly increasing management fees.  In that context, I would like to know what is affordable about this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">In many cases, management companies are controlled by developers and residents have little or no say, despite the fact that the overall aim of such companies is that property owners run them.  This area is filled with confusion and there is a real need for clarity, especially in regard to issues such as maintenance, upkeep and waste management.  Although management fees often start at approximately €1,000, they vary widely and can increase from year to year.  I recently met a young couple who bought into an affordable housing scheme but are now being billed €3,000 for this year's management fees without any justification for the increase.  Residents of apartment complexes feel they are being held to ransom because they are legally obliged to pay management fees even though there is no obligation on management agents to account for the money they collect.  In some cases, residents have come together to agree affordable increases with management agents and have even reduced their fees, which represents a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I recently met a young man who had been awarded a service contract in an apartment complex, but unfortunately he has had to pull out of the contract after waiting three years for payment.  This is another example of the lack of accountability in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The absence of legislation to properly regulate management companies only makes matters worse.   The Government established the National Property Services Regulatory Authority in 2005, a director was appointed in 2006 and staff of the authority occupy offices in Navan.  It was allocated a budget of €700,000 for 2007 and €930,000 for 2008 but the director and staff are sitting idle because the legislation which will give it the power to operate has not yet been brought before the Dail.  It is time to enact this legislation to give people an opportunity to have their say in where they live and what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Sinking funds are needed to address issues as they arise.  In one such issue in my area, young people who had just moved into an apartment complex had to pay €2,500 for repairs after a series of break-ins.  Residents have described serious deficiencies in personal security provisions such as CCTV, poor security at entrance points and even a lack of adequate fire escapes.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Reforms are urgently needed and I call on the Government to regulate management companies without further delay.  Apartment owners have been left at the mercy of management agencies for too long.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_518">I commend Deputy Hogan on moving this Private Members' motion.  Legislation is urgently needed on the issue of management companies.  While the problems are particularly serious in Dublin, they have also affected bigger towns throughout the country in recent years.  In many villages, expanding housing estates give rise to management committee issues.  A debate is needed in this House on legislation that will adequately alleviate the problems experienced by owners when they purchase apartments and houses.  Some of these are first-time buyers and some are in rented accommodation.  These people need the protection of legislation, which must be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Management committees or personnel are put in place who know nothing about the particular area of which they are in charge.  I know of one instance in my constituency where there are very expensive payments to the committee but people are not getting work done simply because the people in charge have no local knowledge.  That is a most important factor.  It should be laid down in legislation that people in these positions should have local knowledge of the whole community.  I urge the Government to wake up to the fact that there is a real problem out there for people.  There is a concern and fear in this regard because people have commitments, including financial commitments.  We must debate the matter.  The local authority should be listened to and members of the local authority should make it accountable.  That is another significant factor.  We need debate followed by legislation.  It is a real fear and the Government has hidden from the issue while doing nothing.  This Private Members' motion may do nothing but ensure we pass relevant legislation in the near future, and I hope that happens.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I support this Private Members' motion brought before the House by Deputies Phil Hogan and Terence Flanagan.  This issue is nothing new and has been going on for the past ten or 15 years.  My colleagues have dealt with the position on the ground.  I recommend that a few practical measures be put in place.  The type of structured company which needs to be put in place is a company limited by guarantee without having a share capital.  Many management companies are being established as companies with share capital.  A simple structure would be a company limited by guarantee without share capital, which would ensure an equal vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is absolutely critical for legislation to be brought before the House to put in place structures that would ensure a smooth transition to owners of the apartment blocks within a short period after the development is completed.  The current process will probably be a feature in future whereby some developments take a long time to complete and it could be a number of years before responsibility is handed over to the owners of the apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">There must be a clear undertaking from developers that they will explain to people who own apartments their duties when they take over management of the company.  A few practical measures should also be put in place.  For example, the annual general meeting should be set for a specific date and management meetings should be held at regular intervals so people within developments are aware of the funding involved and how much it costs.  In addition, service charges should be explained so people know exactly what they are getting into.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Sinking funds are nothing new but they have never been enforced.  The purpose of a sinking fund is to ensure provision is made for the upkeep of communal areas.  In many cases, the option was not taken up and the areas run into disrepair.  This must be explained.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The key element is proper legislation, which should be brought forward.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, speaking earlier about changing the rules in terms of filing returns with the Companies Office.  This should be considered carefully as currently lay people are taking over the running of management companies.  They spend their time chasing down the developer to take over the running of the company.  The requirements with regard to the Companies Office are not explained, and when they find themselves as directors, they are not able to meet their deadlines.  I welcome the measure outlined by the Minister but the system must operate practically.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">We need legislation as a matter of urgency and it must be debated.  A key element is for people to be made aware by developers of exactly the type of apartment being bought and their duties.  A series of practical measures should be introduced to let owners know what they are paying for.  If people were aware of the work being done based on the contribution to management companies, the majority would agree with it.  Currently, nobody is being held accountable.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">I support the motion and compliment Deputies Phil Hogan and Terence Flanagan on bringing it forward.  I also thank my colleagues for allowing me to eat into their time.  This is a very important issue, much more so than most of the political establishment believes.  It affects 500,000 people, both homeowners and landlords.  Some 4,000 units in my constituency of Dublin West are controlled by management companies and probably inhabited by approximately 12,000 people.  Another 3,000 such units are planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I am affected by this in that I am a member of a management company and I pay a management fee.  Thankfully, I am in a position where the owners control the management company, although it was not easy to take it over.  I am happy to pay the fee — approximately €1,200 per year — for the service I get but that is only because I am a member of the group which controls it and decides what the money is spent on.  If we want more, we pay more and if want less, we pay less.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">We all accept there must be management companies in apartment buildings, although the concept is not confined to them.  For houses and mixed developments the idea is more complicated.  I heard the comments of Deputy Ciarán Lynch of the Labour Party, which I almost entirely agreed with, except for the proposal that management companies be banned from housing estates.  I do not agree with that as some people want management companies in housing developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">There are two examples in my constituency, Hollystown and Summerton, which the Minister will be familiar with and which are controlled by management companies.  The people there very much want to have their landscaped lawns, gates and so on, and they should be allowed to have them.  This is not a communist country and people should not be prohibited from having a management company should they so wish.  That is not the case for the vast majority of people who are subject to management companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">There are a few major problems and it is important we address them.  It is not the case that most management companies are controlled by owners.  In my constituency, for example, Menolly Homes, and Mr. Seamus Ross in particular, are developers well known to the party opposite.  It writes into its memorandum and articles of association that the developer has 1,000 votes, with others having one vote per apartment.  Another developer well known to the party opposite writes into the——</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I will.  To move on, there is an issue of the areas taken in charge.  There are cases in some instances where maintenance of parts of a development which will be taken in charge is paid for by the management company in the meantime.  With another well known development company, even though the management company is up and running, the title of the common areas has not been transferred to the management company.  In effect, the management company is looking after land it does not own and people are paying for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I am very disappointed with what I have heard from the Government to date.  Everything I heard today from the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I heard before by way of parliamentary questions from the Minister opposite or in previous debates.  We saw the report of the Office of Corporate Enforcement, as well as a report from the National Consumer Agency and an interim report from the Law Reform Commission.  This has been ongoing for six years and I do not have confidence that the Government takes the issue seriously or will introduce legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I guarantee the parties opposite, including the Green Party and Fianna Fáil, that this will be a significant campaign issue in the run-up to the local elections.  If legislation is not in place and implemented by then, the parties will pay for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">The Government is well aware of this extremely serious problem, which affects many individuals who live in multi-unit developments or the more traditional mixed developments to which Deputy Varadkar referred.  The Government is very concerned about this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I welcome the tabling of this motion by Fine Gael because this debate has placed a focus on an issue that was of great concern to me during my time at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The original motion outlines various specific issues, all of which are dealt with in the consultation paper published by the Law Reform Commission.  It was envisaged at the time of the publication of this paper that a final report, in which detailed proposals for the Government in respect of this matter would be contained, would be prepared by the Law Reform Commission.  I am sorry that this report has not yet been received.  I understand that it will be forthcoming in a number of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The Government decided to establish a high level Cabinet sub-committee, the membership of which comprises the relevant Ministers with responsibility in this area, to commence work on this subject prior to the publication of the Law Reform Commission's final report.  The Law Society put forward an extremely detailed submission to the Law Reform Commission in recent weeks and the latter has delayed its final consideration of this matter pending its examination of the views of the former.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Anyone who examines this area will discover that it is an extremely difficult one in respect of which to legislate.  The core difficulty is that the purchasers of these units, regardless of whether they are located in multi-unit, single or mixed developments, entered into binding contractual commitments in respect of the management of their estates.  These people are, therefore, locked into arrangements as a matter of private law.  It is always difficult to legislate in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Many of the abuses in this area have been outlined by previous speakers.  I do not intend to add to the record save to say that I have witnessed and have experience of many of those abuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">One of the major difficulties in this area is that when a purchaser is put in possession of property, he or she is not placed in an immediate position to exercise his or her rights in respect of their management company.  The effective control of these properties rests with the developers long after it should be passed on to the purchasers.  The Law Reform Commission intends to bring forward proposals in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">One of the reasons an interministerial committee is required to investigate this matter is that the changes relate not just to property law, but also to company law.  In such circumstances, interlocking legislation will be required to deal with the company and property law implications attaching to these developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">In the context of company law, a specific type of company will be required in respect of the developments to which we are referring.  We cannot continue to operate the traditional bells-and-whistles company law model with regard to this type of arrangement.  A specific type of company will, therefore, have to be devised.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I look forward to the publication of the final report of the Law Reform Commission because it will provide a template upon which the Government can take urgent action in respect of this matter.  There is no doubt that such action is required.  We will, however, encounter difficulties regarding those purchasers who have locked themselves into binding legal arrangements.  We are not merely discussing a practice that can be varied; we are referring to legal rights and entitlements that have been arrived at by the vendors and purchasers of properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">As Deputy Varadkar quite fairly acknowledged, there are instances where management is desirable and not just in the context of multi-unit developments.  There are some purchasers who want gated developments and who are themselves happy to provide services.  If they are so minded, I have no objection to their doing so and the State should facilitate their wishes.  There are, however, many people who have experienced difficulties with management companies.  In that context, we must consider the issue of corporate compliance and the level of such compliance to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The legislation relating to property management agents, which is with the Parliamentary Counsel, is overdue.  I decided to proceed in any event with the establishment of the interim board.  I accept the fact that it does not have legal powers but it is better that it is commencing its work now rather than being obliged to wait until after the establishment of the authority.  The classic model is that the House establishes an authority and then implements it a few years later.  At least the regulatory authority for property services is starting to operate in Navan.  In time, legislative provision will be made that will allow it to make more effective decisions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_556">I wish to share time with Deputies Clune and Hogan.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The problem relating to management companies is ongoing.  I raised it with various Ministers in the past three years and matters have not moved on in that time.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, on Tuesday, 27 June 2006 and I received a reply which stated: "In late 2005 I requested that a survey be carried out of planning authorities regarding their policy on attaching planning conditions relating to management companies."  The then Minister indicated that he received replies from 90% of local authorities.  I made further inquiries a year later and discovered that, much to my embarrassment, the Department had not received replies from Galway City Council and Galway County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Members on all sides have referred to the difficulties experienced in respect of management companies running apartment complexes.  In Galway, many such companies have been appointed to run conventional housing developments.  For example, I am aware of a development of four detached houses in a particular area of Galway and another of 38 houses at Clybaun Court, Knocknacarra — 34 of which are semi-detached and four of which are detached — in respect of which the city council stipulated that management companies would have to be established.  Despite the fact that some of the residents of the latter estate obtained more favourable quotes in respect of maintaining grass verges or whatever it is management companies do, it was not possible to replace the management company that had been set up.  Some of the directors of that company are employees or have connections to the construction company that built the estate.  Everything is nicely tied up and it does not seem possible for the residents to extricate themselves from this arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">I also raised this matter on the Adjournment on a previous occasion and the Minister stated: "On 25 January 2006, my Department issued circular letter PD 1/06 reminding local authorities of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 regarding taking in charge of estates."  However, nothing has been done in the interim.  Commitments were made in respect of this matter in the programme for Government agreed in 2002.  Again, however, action has not been taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I welcome the fact that the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance have contributed to this debate.  Fine Gael is honoured that three such prominent Ministers have come before the House to address the motion.  I cannot recall a previous occasion on which three of the most senior Ministers in Cabinet addressed a Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  Perhaps an advance of sorts, under which greater responsibility will be placed on Ministers, is being made at the behest of the new Taoiseach.  Usually a Minister of State or someone who has no connection to the relevant Department is sent to the House to deal with matters of this nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">Management companies set up by developers are charging apartment owners anything from €450 to €2,000 per year in fees.  The Minister for Finance stated that such owners have entered into binding legal arrangements.  I am aware of instances where management fees were imposed in apartment complexes and where now, three to five years later, such fees are also being imposed in respect of car parking facilities.  I do not know how it is possible to charge tenants who purchased car parking spaces €70 to €90 in management fees.  These people were not told that such fees would be imposed when they originally purchased their apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I am delighted the Minister is taking this matter seriously, particularly in light of the upcoming local elections.  From previous experience, however, I am sceptical that the legislation necessary to deal with this matter will be introduced.  I could not discover from Galway City Council, despite making four or five phone calls between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. today, whether it is continuing to impose planning conditions which stipulate that management companies must be established in respect of conventional housing estates.  I suspect, however, that the practice is continuing.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_565">I thank Deputy Phil Hogan and Deputy Terence Flanagan for putting down this motion, which concerns a very relevant and real issue in terms of how people in modern Ireland are living.  I notice the new Taoiseach referred yesterday to young people and how he wants to make politics relevant to them.  If the Taoiseach could ensure that the items outlined in the motion were implemented, this would certainly make politics relevant to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">It is estimated that 500,000 people live in apartments or mixed complexes, whether of duplexes or townhouses.  Many of them face difficulties in the areas in which they live.  In many cases they purchased during the property boom, with units being bought off the plans as they queued up to put down a deposit.  They never really thought of the consequences regarding the management of the open spaces, lifts, car parks and gates within the complex.  For many residents, the situation has become a living nightmare.  They have seen the appearance of their homes and neighbourhoods deteriorate.  Nobody is in charge and people who have contributed to management fees or service charges do not feel they are getting fair representation.  Some people opt out of a payments scheme and do not pay so the burden falls on others.  The situation is a complete mess and a nightmare for these people.  It is important for all of us living in urban areas to ensure that complexes are well looked after and maintained.  They could be a blot on the landscape for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Anyone who has served on a local authority, as I have, will know of the changes to density guidelines that were issued through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, particularly for urban areas, which have seen a huge increase in apartment-type complexes and apartment living for individuals.  When transport links were established, such as the Luas in Dublin, there was a proliferation of high density accommodation near those links.  In Cork, the Cork to Midleton railway line is under construction and will attract high density living due to the proximity of the transport link.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">If we want to ensure this type of high density living works for people, we need to introduce legislation and structures which will ensure that residents who buy into these complexes have assurances they will be managed and that the management structures will work.  The National Property Services Regulatory Authority was established in 2005 but, three years later, it still has not been put on a statutory footing.  The minimum we need at this stage is that it would be given the powers to do what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Many of us have constituents who contact us about the frustrations they are experiencing in their areas.  Management companies are not finishing off estates or complexes, or are holding onto one final unit in the hope that they will then be able to expand into an adjoining field.  In such cases, the management structures can fall apart because of a loophole or because the last piece of the jigsaw has not been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The problems have been highlighted not only in the House, but by the National Consumer Agency, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Dublin City Council and the Law Reform Commission.  People are screaming out for support and a legislative process to which they can turn.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to adopt the policies proposed in this motion and give those young people an opportunity to live in comfort.  More importantly for all of us, as we are developing urban landscapes, we must ensure it is done properly.  This is about the future of our cities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_571">I thank the speakers who took part in the debate.  Many Deputies gave their constituency experiences with regard to how major an issue this is, particularly in large urban centres.  As some speakers noted, it is a growing phenomenon throughout the country, particularly with recent large-scale urban developments in the commuter belt and further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I thank the Labour Party for supporting the Bill.  I cannot support the Sinn Féin amendment because I have no confidence in the local authority system to deal with this issue at present.  My experience is that local authorities have great difficulty taking estates in charge, in spite of the legislation.  They do not want to take them in charge because it will cost them money.  While that is not an excuse for local authorities not doing their business properly under the Act, it is the reality and the way things work in the local government system.  People should be entitled to organise their own affairs and take responsibility for their own complex, but to do so in a way that is properly regulated and underpinned by a base of primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I acknowledge what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has said in this regard.  I also congratulate him on his appointment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_575">I acknowledge that there is a legal quagmire but we need to resolve this issue.  Cross-departmental requirements that are in place are well understood but what is frustrating people, and what motivated Fine Gael to put down the motion, is that it has taken so long to try to resolve the issue.  It was in the 2002 programme for Government.  Things work slowly in this country at times but I hope they would not work that slowly for all things.  Six years is long enough.  It is the frustration at the lack of action that motivated this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I acknowledge that the Government has done its best to try to come to some kind of universal view in its amendment.  Nevertheless, regrettably, we feel we must divide the House on what is an important issue for many people because we want to create more urgency about the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">A couple of Law Reform Commission reports considered the issues.  I hope the information from the commission, which the Minister made available to us, will not provide another excuse for dragging matters out and that the commission will come up with recommendations and publish them at the end of May, which was the indicative date given to us.  While that date might be optimistic, we would like to see the legislation published, certainly before the summer.  If the Government could tell the House the legislation will be published before the summer recess, it would be a move in the right direction but I feel it is not such a position considering what the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had to say today.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">In some cases people have suffered a degree of extortion from irresponsible developments and management companies that were established on a willy-nilly basis, without being underpinned by law.  This is part of the reason many of our constituents contact us about this problem.  We have waited long enough.  The genesis of the issue was an allowance in the Planning and Development Acts that management companies were to be established without the basis of law, including company law.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Many people are left in a legal limbo.  When they engaged in such an important financial transaction, they should have been properly advised by their legal advisers and mortgage providers about the cumbersome nature of dealing with these issues.  The National Consumer Agency has a booklet about their obligations which should be made available to every purchaser by the legal profession or mortgage provider.  In many instances they need to have their eyes opened to some of the difficulties that may emerge in the context of organising a management company.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I thank all speakers for their contributions to this important debate.  I hope it will give a sense of urgency to the Government to move more quickly than it has in the six years to date.  Accordingly, I put the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_714">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I am pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Defamation Bill 2006 to the House.  This Bill comprehensively reforms the law on defamation and replaces the current legislation, which dates back to 1961.  It provides a modern framework and gives statutory expression to developments in the jurisprudence of the Irish courts and elsewhere, including the European Court of Human Rights.  While the road to reform has been slow and has taken a number of turns, the deliberative process and consultations have been intensive and productive.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">A review of the legislation on defamation was conducted as far back as the early 1990s, which culminated in the publication of a final report by the Law Reform Commission in December 1991.  The report contained more than 50 detailed proposals for reform in this area of the law.  In 1996, the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry also made recommendations for changes in the law.  In December 2001, the then Government approved the drafting of a Bill.  Following on from that, the agreed programme for the Government formed in 2002 contained a commitment to legislation in this area.  In September 2002, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, established a legal advisory group on defamation to report on the implications of this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Subsequent to the publication of the legal advisory group's report in June 2003, my Department conducted an intensive public consultation process on the report.  This included a major conference in December 2003 that facilitated an exchange of views with a wide cross-section of interested parties.  Extensive consultations were held with the Irish Press Industry Steering Committee, which brought together representatives of national and regional newspapers, as well as UK newspapers with Irish editions and periodical publishers.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Bill that is before the House is largely the text that was presented to the Seanad in July 2006 by the then Minister, Michael McDowell.  I took a close interest in the comments of Senators during the extensive debate on the Bill in the other House.  I would welcome the same close scrutiny of this important and ground-breaking legislation by Members of the Dáil so we can get the balance right.  In 2007, my predecessor undertook a short and focused process of consultation on the Defamation Bill and the Privacy Bill, which was published by the last Administration.  The Government has decided to pursue the Defamation Bill at this time.  I hasten to add that the Privacy Bill remains on the Seanad Order Paper, having been approved by the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I commend the recent decision of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, which vindicated the right to privacy of a member of this House.  The decision will be welcomed by all sides in the Oireachtas and beyond.  The good start that has been made by the Press Council augurs well for the future.  I welcome the fact the newspaper in question published the decision in a position of prominence, similar to the position in which the offending article was printed.  Such an approach is required under the legislation before the House.  I am pleased that this requirement has been observed by the newspaper concerned in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The current defamation legislation falls short in a number of ways.  It is unhelpful to all concerned that an apology, which is often all that is required, cannot be made to an aggrieved person without it being taken as an admission of liability.  Unlike in other civil actions, no lodgment can be made in court against a defamation action without admission of liability.  It is clear that an insufficient range of remedies, other than damages, is available to an aggrieved person.  It is unsatisfactory that there is an absence of clarity on the role of the court in giving directions about the level of awards, that plaintiffs do not have to swear affidavits about the nature of their complaints and that applicants are not compelled to take the stand for cross-examination.  That defamation actions can be taken up to six years after the publication of the alleged libel has understandably been the subject of much complaint by media organisations.  On the other hand, aggrieved people had no real practical alternatives to court proceedings, such as a complaints system based on a code of standards operated by the press, until the recent formation of the Press Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Existing legislation lags behind the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is not in line with developments in the jurisprudence in other jurisdictions on the appropriate balance between freedom of expression and protection of one's good name.  The new provisions in the Bill will give plaintiffs a better sense of their rights under the law.  New forms of remedy will be available to those interested in obtaining speedy redress when they have been defamed.  The new legislation will provide greater clarity for publishers, help responsible publishers to avoid making defamatory statements and provide guidance about the limits of the various defences which are open to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The Bill supports the concept of an independent Press Council, which can be afforded statutory recognition by both Houses of the Oireachtas on foot of a motion by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as long as it meets certain criteria set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  A code of practice to which print media organisations can subscribe and adhere is a critical element of the independent regulation of the press.  We now have such a code.  It should not fall to me as Minister, or to the Government, to dictate the exact detail of a code of practice.  However, Schedule 2 provides some guidance about the basic standards expected in such a code, in the public interest.  The Press Council has made it clear that the code will be organic and will evolve as circumstances require.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I am concerned that some publications have yet to subscribe to the Press Council of Ireland.  While I realise these are early days, I urge all media organisations and publications to attain membership of the council, for their own benefit as well as that of complainants.  I encourage the early publication by the council of details of its membership to ensure full transparency.  One of the primary benefits of a statutorily recognised press council, as provided for in this legislation, is that qualified privilege attaches to its reports and decisions, or those of a subsidiary body such as the Office of the Press Ombudsman which has been established by the council.  Subscription to the Press Council and adherence to its code of practice by a publication will strengthen its entitlement to avail of the new statutory defence of reasonable publication on a matter of public interest in any court action.  To avail of that defence, publications which choose not to join the Press Council, for whatever reason, will be required to have in place an equivalent fairness regime or to operate an equivalent and publicised code of standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Bill puts on a statutory basis a new defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest.  I hasten to add that the defence is subject to certain conditions.  It is designed to be used by newspapers which decided to publish certain material to facilitate public discussion, on the basis of there being a benefit and an interest in such discussion taking place.  This new defence takes cognisance of jurisprudence at European Court of Human Rights level.  In particular, it is based on certain decisions of Irish and UK courts.  The genesis of the defence first arose in these islands in the decision made by the UK court of appeal in 2001 in the case of Reynolds <i>v</i>. <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  In September 2006, the court refined and clarified its nature and purpose in the case of Jameel and others <i>v</i>. <i>The Wall Street Journal Europe</i>.  The court overturned an award against that paper and allowed its defence of reasonable publication on a matter of public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The UK court of appeal ruled in the Jameel case that the defence of reasonable publication is in a new jurisprudential category.  It is not the same as a defence of privilege.  A number of conditions have to be fulfilled before a responsible publication can plead reasonable publication.  In the introduction to its judgment, the court noted that there is a balance between the development of this new defence and the strengthening of the law on privacy.  The thrust of the Jameel case was accepted by Mr. Justice Charleton in his consideration of the 2007 case of Leech <i> v</i>. Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">This new defence is designed to facilitate responsible journalism.  It is not a charter to engage in casual defamation or character assassination.  It is not a licence for sloppy or vindictive practice by journalists or editors.  It will be for the courts to decide what credence to give to an editor or a journalist who tries to cloak himself or herself in such a defence without proper regard for its purpose.  Given that this is a significant change in our law, I will welcome the views of Deputies on the details of the defence.  I will examine the matter further with the Attorney General in advance of Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Bill makes special provision in relation to the issue of damages.  It makes it clear that a judge in a High Court defamation action will give directions to the jury in relation to damages.  It sets out a wide range of factors to which the court will have regard in awarding damages.  It provides that the Supreme Court, on appeal, may substitute its own level of damages for that awarded by the High Court.  These provisions have been developed against a background of recent case law in our courts.  I suggest that they offer clarity and some certainty on policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I wish to highlight some of the other main provisions of the Bill.  Section 5 provides that the present torts of libel and slander will cease to be so described and will instead be collectively described as the "tort of defamation".  Section 7 provides that the plaintiffs and defendants in a defamation action will be required to submit a sworn affidavit verifying assertions and allegations and to make themselves available for cross-examination.  That is not necessarily the case at the moment, which is a strange aspect of our law.  It is now being provided that a person must swear that he or she has been defamed and make himself or herself available for cross-examination, as a condition of bringing an action.  I believe that is a reasonable position.  It will be an offence for a person to make a statement in an affidavit which is false or misleading in any material respect, or that he or she knows to be false or misleading.  This mirrors the approach taken in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Another aspect of the Bill, contained in section 22, is that an offer of apology will not be construed as an admission of liability.  The current legal situation effectively precludes this and impedes the giving of a speedy apology which, in some cases at least, might result in a decision not to proceed with court action.  With regard to apologies, the Bill provides, following amendment in the other House, that in situations where an apology is being made and published by a defendant, the apology will be given the same or similar prominence as was given to the original statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The Bill includes other useful provisions which I will outline.  Under section 27, the defendant in defamation proceedings may in future lodge in court a sum of money without admission of liability.  This mirrors the present position with regard to other civil actions where damages are sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Provision is made for new remedies which a court may grant in lieu of, or in addition to, damages.  These remedies will, in the normal course, be predicated upon a plaintiff having requested a timely and conspicuous retraction of the defamatory matter in circumstances where the defendant has failed to accede to that request.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Under section 26, a declaratory order, for which a plaintiff may apply in lieu of damages, is intended to offer a speedy means of redress where the only issue is the wish of a plaintiff to have an acknowledgement that the matter in question was defamatory of him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">A correction order is envisaged, under section 28, as an additional remedy to declaratory judgments, as it allows the possibility of damages which may direct the terms of any correction that a court orders to be made in favour of a plaintiff.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">A range of factors intended to guide the court in making an award of general damages is specified in section 29.  Juries are being retained for High Court proceedings, but the trial judge shall give directions to a jury on the matter of damages.  Aggravated and punitive damages are maintained under section 30, but are limited to specific instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The defences available in defamation proceedings are rationalised and clarified in sections 14 to 25, inclusive.  A list of occasions where absolute privilege arises is provided in section 15.  The defence of qualified privilege is given a statutory basis for the first time under section 16.  It will attach to the reports and decisions of the Press Council recognised under section 41.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">As I mentioned, under section 24, the defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest is created in statute form for the first time in Ireland.  The exact provisions concerning the recognition of an independent Press Council are set out in section 41.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The conditions with regard to the making of an offer of amends are updated in sections 20 and 21, along with the consequences for acceptance or non-acceptance of the offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Under section 25, the common law position with regard to the liability of distributors for defamatory material is being given a statutory basis known as "the defence of innocent publication".  The defence develops in a more comprehensive way the common law defence of innocent publication, which has traditionally been available to distributors, in particular for those such as Internet service providers, in recognition of the speed with which modern technology works.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Under section 11, bodies corporate may sue for defamation irrespective of whether financial loss had occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Under section 35, a limitation period of one year will apply to the bringing of defamation proceedings unless, where the interests of justice so require, a court directs otherwise and may allow a period of two years for exceptional cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">A special jurisdiction limit of €50,000 for defamation actions in the Circuit Court is provided for in section 38.  The current Circuit Court limit for damages claims is €38,092.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I am giving further consideration to Part 5 of the Bill, which provides for the abolition of the common law offences of criminal libel, seditious libel and obscene libel.  It is my intention to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to deal with the offences created in Article 40.6.1.i of the Constitution relating to the publishing of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter.  Sanctions for these offences, which include both fines and imprisonment, are contained in Part 2 of the Defamation Act 1961 and in other enactments.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">If we repeal in full the provisions of the 1961 Act in reforming our defamation laws, we would be at risk of creating a lacuna, unless we make some provision in regard to the constitutional offences.  Ensuring there is no lacuna created is therefore a significant consideration.  My predecessor had been in consultation with the Attorney General as to how best to proceed in dealing with the issues and I intend to bring that consultation to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Bill does not provide for defamation of the dead.  The technical, legal difficulties of so providing were examined closely by the Law Reform Commission and others.  This was also an issue which arose during the consultation period and during the course of the lengthy Seanad debate.  Section 36 does, however, provide that on the death of a person, a cause of action for defamation vested in him or her immediately before death, should survive for the benefit of their estate.  Similarly, it also provides that a cause of action in defamation subsisting against a person should survive their death and lie against their estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">There are two important Schedules as part of the Bill.  Schedule 1 provides a list of statements having qualified privilege.  The list includes determinations or statements by the Press Council or Ombudsman.  Schedule 2 provides for the minimum requirements concerning a body seeking recognition as the Press Council for the purposes of the Act.  The Minister will have to satisfy himself or herself that these criteria are being met prior to making an order declaring the applicant organisation to be the Press Council for the purposes of the Act.  Once recognition is granted, there can be only one such body.  An order of recognition granted to the Press Council may be amended or revoked, should the Minister form the opinion that the council no longer meets the minimum requirements set out in Schedule 2.  However, in that event, before the moving of any order to this effect, the Press Council must be afforded the opportunity to address the issues of concern.  The Schedule also prescribes minimum conditions for the appointment of a Press Ombudsman who will investigate, hear and determine complaints made to the Press Council concerning the conduct of its members and the complaints procedure.  The Schedule also prescribes the code of standards to be adhered to, as well as the rules and practices to be complied with by members of the Press Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">This Bill will bring about a significant modernisation of the law on defamation.  It seeks to respect the necessary balance between the equally important but sometimes competing rights of freedom of expression and of respect for one's good name and reputation.  I would welcome the contributions of all sides of the House on this matter.  I will be willing to consider any reasonable amendments that may be suggested by all sides of the House.  The Bill represents a significant change in our defamation laws.  As such, the House should take some time to consider it, particularly in view of the fact that it has undergone a robust examination of various aspects by Members of the Upper House.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_748">I wish to acknowledge the recent appointment of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I wish him every success in his new portfolio.  I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and thank him for his personal courtesy to me as Opposition spokesman.  I recognise the previous Minister's work in the Department, albeit over a short period.  It is a long time since the new Minister and I were Government and Opposition Whips, respectively.  Since then, the Minister has dealt with a number of important issues in various Departments.  I wish him well in his new role.  Fine Gael will offer him co-operation on matters which should be prioritised in the areas of justice, security, law reform and equality.  It is a large Department and perhaps nobody knows better than the Opposition spokesman the wide range of briefs concerned, which can be both time consuming and taxing.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">As a fresh face in the Department, perhaps the Minister could consider, along with his Government colleagues, restoring or building on the civil and criminal justice arms of the Department.  In the 1990s, the civil arm was separated into the equality and law reform portfolio, while the criminal arm deals with matters of domestic security.  The Department has a wide brief with major responsibilities.  I consider that the experiment in the 1990s worked reasonably well, albeit that a small Department was being serviced at the time under the direction of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  That concept might be revisited, especially in view of what other jurisdictions have done in separating the various sections of their departments of justice.  I look forward to debating the issues of concern and the challenges that lie ahead in the Department, and I wish the Minister well.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Fine Gael supports this Bill.  For some time we have been calling for appropriate changes and amendments to be made to defamation law.  We acknowledge the important role of the media as the Fourth Estate in a democracy.  It is important that a country has a vibrant and free media as free speech is an important fundamental pillar of democracy.  What we must always try to do is strike a balance between the right of an individual to his or her good name and the right to report in a free and unfettered manner.  It is a long time since 1961 so it is important to revisit the legislation and modernise the laws dealing with slander, libel and the various defences to them.  A considerable body of case law has built up in this area and it is necessary to codify that law in one legislative measure, particularly with regard to the defences to an action.  That legislation is now before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">A number of recent cases, particularly cases involving a late former Member of this House and a widely read Sunday newspaper, showed up deficiencies in the current legislation.  Often, all that is required is an apology and, in some cases, only a simple apology but that cannot be done under the current legislation because it is connected to an admission of liability.  That will change under this Bill.  Similarly, unlike in the case of other civil actions, no lodgement can be made in court against a defamation action without it including an admission of liability.  That has given rise to an adversarial stand-off between parties, with no resolution taking place until a court hearing, which might not occur until a number of years after the initial publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">It is also important that the range of remedies would expand and develop beyond mere damages.  I welcome the proposals regarding rectification, clarification, declaratory orders and the other remedies excluding monetary compensation.  There is also a need for clarity in respect of the role of the court in giving directions on the level of awards.  This area has been something of a lottery in that it has not been possible to measure the damages in any consistent way.  That has given rise to confusion and uncertainty, so the giving of directions on the level of awards is welcome.  Similarly, at present the applicant or plaintiff or aggrieved party does not have the opportunity to submit sworn affidavits to corroborate their complaint.  That will change, which is welcome.  Perhaps the reading of such affidavits could give rise to earlier settlements than might otherwise be the case, as it will be possible to see from the affidavits the points of concern that remain at issue.  Furthermore, the plaintiff or applicant will be in a position to take the stand for cross-examination, which they cannot be compelled to do under current legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The issue of time is important.  The Press Council and the Press Ombudsman have spoken of the need for a swift response.  This is most important.  Currently, defamation actions in the High Court, where most defamation cases are taken, take up to six years to be heard.  That is unacceptable when time is of the essence.  There is a direct and clear link between the publication of the offending item and the hurt, grievance and damage caused.  To allow a time lapse of four to six years in resolving the issue is in nobody's interest and certainly not in the interest of the applicant or aggrieved party.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Currently, there is no provision in the law for a defence of reasonable publication, which is a weakness.  I am delighted with the range of defences outlined in reasonably clear terms in section 14 of this Bill.  I noted the Minister's comments on the defence of reasonable publication and I look forward to dealing with that in detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill seeks to address many of the current deficiencies in the law with varying degrees of success.  There was a considerable amount of debate on the Bill in the Seanad before its reading on Second Stage today.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The new complaints procedure is welcome.  I assume that anybody can make a complaint and that it is not necessary to have an immediate, first party interest in the matter.  I presume it is open to any member of the community at any time to make a complaint on a matter about which they feel aggrieved and that it is not necessary for that person to have an interest in or have been mentioned in the publication.  Indeed, the Press Ombudsman said on his appointment that the remedy he envisages would be free, fair and quick.  These elements are of great importance.  I welcome the defences set out in Part 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">There was a long period of public debate before the introduction of this Bill.  That was welcome even if the legislation was delayed in that time.  The Law Reform Commission report was published in December 1991.  It contained 59 detailed proposals for reform.  A draft defamation Bill was commissioned by the National Newspapers of Ireland in 1994, while a Private Members' Bill was introduced by the former Deputy, Michael McDowell, in the mid-1990s.  In 1996, there were further recommendations for reform from the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  The Government approved the draft Bill in December 2001 and in the following year the then Minister, former Deputy Michael McDowell, established an advisory group on defamation.  The 2002 programme for Government contained a commitment that the Government would, in the context of a statutory press council and improved privacy laws, move to implement reforms of the libel law designed to bring it into line with that of other states.  The former Minister, former Deputy Michael McDowell, said in the Seanad that the Bill delivers on the commitment in that programme.  However, that was six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">In 2003, on foot of the recommendations of the advisory group, the former Minister initiated public consultation, including a major conference in December 2003, and three years later, in 2006, the Irish press industry steering committee published its proposals for an independent press council, press ombudsman and a code of practice or standards, much of which is incorporated in this legislation.  It has taken this Bill some time to reach the Dáil.  It lapsed with the dissolution of the 29th Dáil and was reintroduced in the 30th Dáil on Committee Stage.  That decision caused some disquiet and annoyance to newly elected Senators who were most anxious to make their contribution to the Bill on Second Stage because they, quite rightly, took the view this was important legislation.  I hope that in the course of this debate, whether on Second Stage or Committee Stage, every Deputy will have an opportunity of airing his or her views and dealing with this matter in a comprehensive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I am delighted the Bill has eventually made its way to the floor of the Dáil, and welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  The media has long called for legislation in this area to ensure clarity and provide alternatives to court proceedings by way of remedy.  While the Government was engaged in the public consultation process, and the draft Bills were being processed into what is before us, the media industry proceeded to take action and established and agreed to fund the offices of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council.  The willingness by the media to step into the breach created by a certain inaction on the part of Government is commendable and shows a commitment to fairness and fair play.  This willingness to engage is a source of great importance.  Dr. John Horgan, the recently appointed Press Ombudsman, served in this House for many years and is doing a commendable job in his current post.  I wish him well, as I am sure every Member of the House does.  Without wishing to comment on individual cases, it is important to note the recent decision by the Press Ombudsman's office as regards a complaint made by a Member of this House which was upheld by the Press Council.  That was widely welcomed not only by politicians, but also by media people and journalists.  That is indicative of a good, positive start to that highly onerous and important position and office.  Dr. Horgan has noted that the job of the Press Council and Press Ombudsman will remain as a work in progress for some time.  That is helpful, because it reflects his experience as a journalist, and as someone who was frequently written about in his earlier career as a practising politician.  It is interesting that the council has a lay majority.  That is important, and the code of practice prepared by a press industry committee appears to be based on very sound principles.  However, it refers to the print media only, and it is important there should be some parallel for the broadcasting sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">There are ten fundamental principles attached to the code of practice, all of which are soundly based: truth and accuracy, distinguishing fact and comment, fairness and honesty, respect for rights, privacy, protection of sources, fairness and accuracy in court reporting, prevention of incitement to hatred, protection of children and the willingness to publish the decision of the Press Ombudsman, if requested to so do.  These principles are very good and I also welcome the element of flexibility adopted by the Press Council which allows the code of practice to be routinely reviewed, amended and added to if necessary.  An appropriate committee of this House should have the opportunity from time to time of officially participating in that debate and playing its part in these reviews, if necessary.  The code of practice forms the basis for decision making by the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council.  I must acknowledge the huge amount of work that went into the formulation of the code, which appears to incorporate best practice not only from Great Britain, but also Australia, Germany and the United States <i>inter alia</i>.  The principles are founded on best international practice.  It is open to any member of the public to complain about any article in an Irish newspaper, magazine or periodical which he or she believes is in breach of the code.  Perhaps there may be some outstanding work to be done in publicising the code’s existence.  Many people are not yet familiar, I believe, with the Office of the Press Ombudsman, his identity or indeed the Press Council, and an information campaign should be undertaken to inform the public in this regard so that a higher level of activity may be generated and the public can be offered the element of redress that is of such absolute importance.  As Dr. Horgan said, the object of the exercise is to provide remedies that are quick, free and fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">There may, however, be a stumbling block in so far as the current subscription to the Press Council's code of practice is voluntary.  When introducing this Bill in its previous incarnation, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, stated that non-members of the Press Council would be required to have an equivalent and published code of standards to benefit from the Bill's provisions in respect of "reasonable publication".</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The Minister made reference to a number of publications that have not yet signed up, and I wonder whether he might provide information as regards what percentage of publications have chosen to date to remain outside the Press Council mandate.  Have most joined up or are many still waiting to participate?  Have alternative codes been established by non-members of the Press Council?  It is important to have one code acceptable to all rather than a variety of different codes and guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Again, as regards the Press Council, in 2003 the legal advisory group reporting to former Deputy McDowell recommended its creation.  He chose to ignore the recommendation at the time and seemed less than certain as regards whether this decision was right.  However, as the Bill provides, the Minister may change his or her mind in future, and put the Press Council on a statutory footing.  I should like to hear the views of the new Minister as to whether that option will be exercised and the council placed on a statutory footing.  I am confident, however, that it will carry out its role in a fair and expedient manner under the stewardship of its current chairman, the eminent Professor Thomas Mitchell, who brings great experience and expertise to that position.  If one wanted a chairman who was truly independent, one must agree he was a great choice, and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">It is important that the council should be guaranteed its funding and the Government has a role in ensuring it is properly resourced.  The question of the source of funding might be a different matter, but it is important that it is properly resourced.  There is the question of the sanctions that are available to the council, an area we may return to at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">As regards the current Bill and the matter of damages, I welcome these provisions.  The media has long made a fair point that the absence of clarity in this regard is somewhat unfair.  There are no guidelines, directions or consistency and a proper balance is struck in allowing the judge to give directions to a jury as regards damages.  Indeed, the definition and clarity as regards what factors should be taken into account in this context are important.  I note special dispensation is being given to the Circuit Court to allow for an increased level of damages from the current level of approximately €38,000 to €50,000.  In the broader civil law area, the Minister should consider increasing the ceiling level of the Circuit Court jurisdiction to accord with what is intended in the Bill to allow for a claim not exceeding a sum of €50,000 having regard to inflationary matters related to the consumer price index, etc.  In recent times people have taken defamation actions in the Circuit Court for no other reason than the speed with which matters can either be settled or brought to a head.  There is a difficulty.  It is reasonable comment that one cannot justifiably put a ceiling on one's reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Much has been written about the insistence of some members of the Cabinet that a Privacy Bill be introduced in tandem with this Bill, when this matter was discussed in another arena in public.  The new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is before us, is on record as saying that he was one of those who favoured the introduction of both Bills, while his immediate predecessor, now Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he would rather ascertain how the Press Council carried out its work and affairs before deciding on whether to proceed with the Privacy Bill.  The Minister has acknowledged the birth of the Privacy Bill which is currently parked in the Seanad — a term used by his predecessor.  The Minister has said it is in the Seanad.  When concluding Second Stage, I ask the Minister to outline whether he shares the views of his predecessor or is he still of the view, as were many of his Fianna Fáil ministerial colleagues, that the Privacy Bill is both necessary and desirable.  It appeared clear that the hand of the former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, was forced by his majority Fianna Fáil colleagues.  While I am not sure about the benefits or otherwise of the Privacy Bill, it is important that the matter of its limbo status be clarified before we reach the concluding Stages of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I accept that the Press Council of Ireland has only been in a position to take complaints since 1 January and just over four months is not sufficient time for a full and fair assessment.  I am anxious to hear the views of the new Minister in this regard.  While we are not debating the Privacy Bill, suffice it to say that the restrictive nature of the Bill in its current form would give rise to concern for my party.  I share the views of the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that we should give the new measures a chance before considering whether there is a need to proceed with the privacy legislation.  After all, we have the Press Council of Ireland and the Press Ombudsman.  If we have faith in the Bill before us it is probably reasonable to give it a chance before proceeding with further legislation.  I do not believe the matter can remain uncertain or in limbo for too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">A number of amendments were made in the Seanad.  From reviewing the Seanad debate it is clear that much work on the Bill took place in that House and some important amendments were not only discussed but also agreed.  One of the more interesting amendments accepted requires that the apology by the media should be given the same or similar prominence to the original offensive article.  I believe that measure will be universally accepted as being fair and efficient towards addressing the complaints of people feeling aggrieved or defamed.  It was totally unsatisfactory to have an offending article on page 1 and a referred apology some weeks later that might be hidden in the corner of the sports' pages.  That is of fundamental importance and I welcome the acceptance by the Minister of amendments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The Minister mentioned the abolition of the criminal, obscene and seditious libel.  I note the provisions in the Bill to abolish these common law offences and to make defamation purely a civil matter, which has been broadly welcomed.  Welcome was given for the prohibition of jailing journalists.  The abolition of the criminal libel will probably ensure that this would be the case.  The Minister said he would refer aspects of Part 5 to the Attorney General.  I hope this matter can be clarified in advance of Committee Stage because there are issues of importance, including the constitutional issues mentioned by the Minister.  I ask the Minister to keep the House informed of his intentions in that regard.  We should have a considerable time between the completion of Second Stage and the introduction of Government amendments, particularly those relating to Part 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I very much welcome the provisions in the Bill allowing a cause of action in defamation cases to survive the death of the parties involved.  This is a most difficult and sensitive issue that has been a source of serious concern to families of people who have themselves suffered because matters were not sufficiently clarified, brought to a head or dealt with before the death of a party who had a grievance or complaint.  There are aspects of this that we should refer to on Committee Stage, as I am sure we will.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I welcome the Bill and I again welcome the Minister on his first day in the Department.  The Bill is overdue.  Notwithstanding the delay, there has been a high degree of public debate of the important issues involved.  I look forward to further examination of the provisions of this legislation on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_771">On my own behalf I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I am not my party's spokesperson on justice; I am standing in for Deputy Rabbitte.  In a general sense I welcome the legislation.  As it does not come under my brief, I would not be as familiar as the spokespersons would be.  I briefly spoke on it when it was debated in the Seanad.  At the time it was pretty well held up by a very long drawn-out debate between the then Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, and Senator Norris.  At the time I wondered whether it would ever come to this House.  Anyway it is good to see it here.  It is good to get the legislation on the Statute Book to bring some clarity to the area of defamation.  In that sense, the Labour Party has always been positive about this legislation.  Former Senator Kathleen O'Meara spoke at length on the legislation, as has Senator Alex White.  In general they would have supported the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Obviously, the Labour Party supports the freedom of expression of the press, which is very important for a democratic society.  At the same time, we need to balance that need with responsible coverage by the press which should show respect for the dignity of the person.  Coverage should be respectful of people because their reputation is very important.  It is only right that if a person's reputation is unfairly tarnished, he or she should have recourse to have the coverage concerned addressed.  In many areas, particularly regarding defamation, the best way to have a grievance addressed is not in an adversarial way but through negotiation and mediation.  I welcome the new position of Press Ombudsman.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">The Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, approved by the Government in October 2007, identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal blood-alcohol content, BAC, for drivers but does not specify what that level should be.  In determining what the BAC limit should be reduced to the advice of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, was sought.  The RSA's recommendations have been received and the Government, in noting the contents of the authority's report at last week's Cabinet meeting, agreed that the RSA's report be published and taken into account in preparing new road traffic legislation this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The issue of lowering the BAC limits will now move into the work underway to prepare for the text of a Road Traffic Bill, which also includes the issue of appropriate penalties for drink driving and other road traffic offences.  I hope to bring the heads of the Bill to the Government later this summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">Does the Minister accept the recommendations and will they be implemented in full?  This applies particularly to the reduction of the blood-alcohol content limit to 20 milligrams for drivers of buses, taxis and commercial vehicles as this is very important.  Does the Minister, like me, receive representations from the vintners' federation and associations around Ireland?  Everybody accepts that the blood-alcohol content limit must be reduced, as is recommended in the report, but does the Minister feel we should reduce vehicle registration tax, VRT, to make it attractive to publicans to provide transport for customers to and from the pub?  I understand the Road Safety Authority would not be against providing special training for such drivers.  Another view is that a special public service vehicle, PSV, licence could be issued to such publicans to help get people home, particularly in rural areas.  This is an issue that has been brought to my attention and could be dealt with while simultaneously reducing the blood-alcohol content limit to the recommended level.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_302" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_780">The Government has accepted the road safety strategy and this means the blood-alcohol content limit will be reduced.  I brought the report to Cabinet last week to inform the Government of the recommendations and to allow me to publish it as I received it from the RSA.  The Government has made no decision on whether it will accept the recommendations on the blood-alcohol content limits.  I was instructed to draft a Bill and bring it forward.  Discussion is to take place in the context of a Bill where not only will the suggested reduction in the blood-alcohol limit be brought forward but also penalties for breaches of the limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Suggestions made by vintners and others on VRT reductions are matters for the Minister for Finance in the context of a budget.  The question of special PSV licences has not been brought to my attention but we are trying to create safer roads so any special arrangements that are to be made should be consistent with our general attitude towards safety.  We aim to ensure that people of good repute and character get PSV licences.  There are many issues in this area, like those mentioned, that should be discussed.  I have no doubt that over the coming months, particularly in the context of the Bill and this report, there will be further discussions before a final decision is made.</p>

These include metro north, the rail interconnector and the cross-city and Lucan Luas lines.  There will also be other major construction activity during the same period, including the renewal of water and electricity services and a number of large private developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">To facilitate the implementation of these Transport 21 projects, the Dublin city manager has set up and is chairing a Dublin Transport 21 implementation group consisting of the chief executives of the principal implementing agencies and representatives of my Department, the Garda Síochána, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Dublin City Business Association.  Among the functions of that group is the preparation of a traffic management plan for the city centre during the construction of the Transport 21 projects.  This plan will make provision for alternative traffic routes and for improved public transport priority measures while taking account of the concerns of various interests, in particular the business community.  All agencies participating in the formulation of the plan are aware of the importance of maintaining access to the centre of Dublin and of retaining its competitive edge.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">In support of the initiative by Dublin City Council, I recently convened a meeting on 6 March of the principal implementing agencies, An Garda Síochána and business representatives, to reassure maximum information was interchanged between the stakeholders.  The meeting was also to identify the principal concerns of the business community and consider how best to support the necessary traffic planning for the construction phase.  This will be the first in a regular series of meetings to review progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The steps outlined constitute an effective approach to the traffic management issues likely to arise from the major investment projects in Dublin city centre.  I am also satisfied that Dublin City Council should continue to lead on the development and implementation of this plan, pending the establishment of the Dublin transport authority on a statutory basis.  In particular, I welcome the personal commitment of the Dublin city manager to this important work.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 is on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Section 64 proposes to give the Dublin transport authority specific statutory responsibility for preparing a strategic traffic management plan for the greater Dublin area which will set out the measures to be taken by the authority to optimise the movements of persons, goods and vehicles.  In particular it will set out action to be taken to minimise the impact of construction work for transport infrastructure and other utilities.  The Bill also proposes to give the authority wide funding and directive powers with surface transport in the greater Dublin area which will enable it to ensure effective action is taken in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_809">Is the Minister saying the Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Tierney, will be responsible for this mega-project, the largest construction project in Dublin city centre since the rebuilding after the 1916 Rising?  Has the Minister completed a detailed risk assessment of the big dig?  Has he received a cost benefit analysis on its impact on city centre business?</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Last week the distinguished journalist, Mr. Frank McDonald pointed out the proposed central metro station will destroy St. Stephen's Green.  Even after the four years of construction and 8,000 truckloads of soil are removed, a quarter of the green will be covered with escape shafts for the station.  What will be the impact of the proposed metro stations at the O'Connell monument and at the Parnell monument on O'Connell Street?  Will it be a case of tens of thousands of trucks moving soil up and down O'Connell Street and the quays?  Many of those who are interested in being involved in this construction project have taken it for granted that the monuments — Dan O'Connell and his angels and Parnell, our lost leader — will have to be moved for several years.  I would not mind if the Spire goes and we do not see it again.  O'Connell Street and all its adjoining streets will be a major construction site for five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">This is a monumental task and the largest one ever overseen by the Minister for Transport.  When Minister for the Environment and Local Government he oversaw the Limerick city drainage project which lost the State €90 million.  This only concerns the metro.  When the interconnector is constructed there will be additional construction work at Christchurch and Pearse Station.</p>

          the reforms he has planned for public bus transport in the greater Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [18002/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_337" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_827">The programme for Government contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin transport authority, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill is on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The Bill sets out the mechanisms for the award of contracts for subvention in line with the new regime introduced under the new EU regulation on public service obligations in the transport sector, which will become mandatory from next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">Proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals to be contained in a public transport regulation Bill.  It is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 relating to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  The new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU regulation. It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, and that the power to grant licences in the greater Dublin area will be given to the Dublin transport authority.  The new Bill will encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the greater Dublin area that are consistent with the EU PSO regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">While it is not possible at this time to indicate precisely when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_831">The Minister is a prisoner of Bus Éireann and the unions.  This was highlighted by his refusal to accept an amendment to the Dublin Transport Authority Bill moved by Senator Donohoe in the Seanad to introduce competition in the bus market.  A supposed core policy of the Progressive Democrats is to increase competition in the bus market, but its Members voted against the amendment.  Half an hour ago, the Minister failed to do his job, namely, to deliver on the promises to introduce competition made by his predecessors, the current Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, and Deputy Brennan.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">"Competition" is not just a word.  It means new choices and routes for new communities, but the Minister has refused them.  This situation will continue until he reforms the Act.  While he stated that he does not know when he will reform it, he will never do so despite this golden opportunity to do it.  Will he reconsider his opinions on Fine Gael's amendment to introduce competition in Dublin and amend the DTA Bill immediately?</p>

            <p eId="para_837">It is not true to state that we are not introducing competition.  The DTA Bill will leave the 1932 and 1958 Acts in place so that anyone, including Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, can operate a commercial route in this city.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">I accept a point made by the Deputy, one that I have also made, that is, the 1932 Act must be reformed, amended and streamlined.  My priority is to pass the DTA Bill through the House with the co-operation of all Deputies, immediately after which I intend to reform the 1932 Act.  Subsequently, we will have a good public transport system and good competition on commercial routes.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">The Minister is a prisoner of the unions and Bus Éireann.  Everyone entitled to compete for a route should be entitled to the PSO.  That the PSO is a subsidy does not mean that private enterprises would not be prepared to accept it or a lesser subsidy than Bus Éireann's.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">However, it is not just a question of Bus Éireann and the unions, which is the Minister's point.  Rather, it is a matter of consumers, new choices and new communities.  There are no new options.  Is it not the case that the Minister could amend the DTA Bill to do away with the licensing process?  Morton's Circle Line is lauded as one of the city's best bus service providers, but it is breaking the law because it does not have a licence.  The Minister stated that it should not break the law, but should it cease operating?  A better alternative would be for the Minister to table amendments to the Bill to allow further competition.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">Recently, my Department received the report of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, referred to by the Deputy.  The report relates to an incident on the Shannon system involving a recreational cruiser.  The MCIB report makes a number of recommendations in respect of boat rental companies and inland waterways, including the review of the navigation buoyage system.  In the overall context of delivering improved maritime safety, these recommendations will be considered by my Department in consultation with, as appropriate, Waterways Ireland, which has responsibility for navigable inland waterways in the North and the South, including the Shannon.  The matter of issuing a marine notice will form part of this review.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_353">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_850">This incident occurred in July 2006.  A recommendation stems from the fact that Emerald Star did not do as it was legally obliged to, namely, to report the incident to the relevant authorities.  The Minister stated that the maritime safety directive will issue, but why has it not already issued?  The MCIB has called for it and has also recommended that Emerald Star review its procedures.  I am thankful that no one died in the incident, but Emerald Star did not ask the boat's crew to disembark and inspect the boat fully as it should have done.  Subsequently, the boat took on water.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">A number of boat rental companies provide mobile telephones to the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who rent pleasure cruisers weekly.  What is the Minister's opinion on VHF equipment, the usage of which on the boats in question has been recommended because it is safer and more effective and efficient than using mobile telephones?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_354" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_852">While I do not want to go into too much detail concerning the incident in question, the MCIB report recommended that all boat rental companies should report every incident to the relevant authorities and that the Department should issue a marine notice to that effect.  Other recommendations related to Emerald Star specifically and called for it to review its procedures in such circumstances.  Pursuant to a recommendation for Waterways Ireland and the Coast Guard to establish a buoyage system, a meeting has been arranged.  All of the report's recommendations, including that in respect of VHF radio equipment, are the subject of ongoing discussions with the relevant authorities.  The Coast Guard and maritime administration intend to arrange a meeting with Waterways Ireland to discuss the recommendations.  Waterways Ireland has indicated that it is open to reviewing the buoyage system on the Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Issuing the marine notice is under consideration by the Coast Guard and maritime administration, which was involved in promoting a safety awareness campaign as part of the ongoing safety programme prior to the recommendations.  Among other elements, this involves a series of radio and on-line safety awareness advertisements and publicity campaigns.  In recent years, a number of measures focusing on life jackets, enforcing licensing requirements, increased safety awareness and so on have been introduced.  On 24 May 2006, a code of practice for the safe operation of recreational craft was launched.  There has been an amount of activity as regards this sector and, while all of the recommendations have not yet been implemented, they will be considered and discussed.</p>

            <p eId="para_854">I welcome the progress.  The buoys on the Shannon are red and black, whereas the equivalent colours internationally are red and green.  The latter are also the colours used in the North.  It is much easier to notice red and green than red and black.  Will that be a fundamental part of the rethinking?  It would be much safer and, according to the board, a black barrel may not have been noticed by the foreigners driving this vessel.  We will not have safety until we adhere to the international standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">The Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 outlines 126 actions and focuses on delivery and outcomes with built-in targets and accountability.  The measures contained in the strategy are based on international best practice and have the endorsement and commitment of all of the stakeholders involved.  One of the actions in the strategy is for the RSA to report to me in the second quarter of each year on the implementation of the 126 actions in the strategy, all of which identify the agency responsible for implementation and the target implementation dates.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">I expect to receive the first report during the second quarter of this year and will bring it to the Cabinet sub-committee, which I chair, because it is important that the implementation of the strategy is co-ordinated at the highest level.  The RSA has already confirmed to me that all actions in the strategy identified for completion in 2007 have been completed in full and I expect the authority to notify me of any specific actions that have not been implemented within the deadlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">Work has begun on other actions in the strategy which have a longer timeframe for completion, such as the introduction of the lower blood-alcohol level for drivers.  The resources for implementation of the strategy are matters for the individual agencies involved.  As regards my area of responsibility, I have arranged to provide additional resources for both the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">I hope all is well in Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">I congratulate the Minister on staying where he is.  It is nice to have a Minister from my county and I suppose that one of the main reasons he remained in his position was to open the M3.  I hope he invites us all to that, unlike the Battle of the Boyne commemoration, in respect of which all our councillors were left sitting at home.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">I will specifically address road safety.  Last month was only the third in the past 100 months in which the number of deaths were kept below 20.  One has to congratulate everybody responsible for that, whether it be the Garda, the Road Safety Authority or the Minister.  In the past 100 months, deaths have been kept below 25 in only 20 months.  We should encourage people to listen to road safety advice.  Some people might not agree but I thought the Garda Síochána was out in force last weekend.  I was stopped three or four times, which is welcome in terms of raising awareness.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Certain people may not want us to discuss blood-alcohol levels but our young people do not want us to drink and drive, nor will they do so themselves.  We cannot afford to be weak on this issue.  There are many reasons for the decline of rural life so we should not simply listen to those who oppose drink driving limits.  The time has come to consider removing VRT on vehicles used to supply social activities for young and old, such as visits to the rural pub.  While visiting Áras an Uachtaráin yesterday, I spoke to Dublin people who avail of these transport opportunities.  More evident than the price of drink in some pubs or the reduction in blood-alcohol limits, the destruction of rural life stems from people buying drink and drugs for little or nothing and then being killed on the roads.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">For €60, three people can get drunk, and take drugs and then they drive cars.  Last week, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke about introducing measures to curb the boy racers who are putting people at risk in the middle of the night.  Will the Minister for Transport consider three measures to add to the RSA's strategy, namely, giving the Garda full authority to pursue those who abuse the rules of the road, removing VRT in respect of publicans and people who provide services for social inclusion and funding on a national basis the position of county road safety officer?  Our county has appointed a road safety officer but no funds have been made available.  We cannot merely create these positions as a public relations exercise.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">I join the Deputy in congratulating all the stakeholders involved in the road safety strategy, including the Garda, the Road Safety Authority, officials of my Department and the many drivers who pay heed to the messages we are putting out.  It was gratifying to see the number of road deaths reduced below 20 during this month and last month, after a less than great start to the year.  There were 15 more deaths in the first two months of this year than during the same period last year.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">As I noted previously, VRT is a matter for the Minister for Finance but I will bring it to his attention.  Rural transport schemes have been introduced in some areas and, while they may not be specifically intended to bring people home from the pub after closing hours, they provide flexible services.  County Meath has a number of flexi-buses which provide useful services.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">In regard to the increasing prevalence of drink and drugs, I agree with the Deputy that young people are more responsible than our generation.  The issue will continue to be targeted.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">I am aware that boy racers can be a significant nuisance and a danger in parts of the country.  When I visited Australia recently, I met officials from that country's police and road transport authorities.  Victoria introduced so-called "hoon" laws, named after the colloquial term in Australia for boy racers.  I do not know if we would be able to impose the penalties imposed there, which range from a fine and confiscation of the car for 24 hours, regardless of who owns the car, on first offence, to confiscation for a period of three months on a second offence to permanent confiscation on a third offence.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_880">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">I have been briefed by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, on the Dublin Airport City business park project, which was launched by the DAA on 25 April 2008.  As explained by the DAA at the launch of the project, a source of funding for the project has yet to be agreed.  I understand phase I of the development may be completed by 2015 with the full project being realised by around 2033.  I welcome a project that has the potential to take advantage of a substantial land bank at the airport and which would generate substantial benefits for the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">As to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, this was established in 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from 2025 until at least 2055.  The fund is controlled and managed by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  The commission has discretionary authority to determine the fund's investment strategy in accordance with the fund's statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.  It is independent in its decisions in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Infrastructure forms part of the fund's strategic asset allocation and the commission is keen to invest in Ireland as part of its overall infrastructure programme.  As I have stated, the independence of the commission in making those decisions is enshrined in law.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_371">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_884">I welcome the proposals but does the Minister not believe the airport authority has enough to do?  As it indicates in its mission statement, it is an airport management company whose principal activities include airport management operation and domestic and international development.  Does the Minister believe it should stick to that role?</p>
            <p eId="para_885">While welcoming and supporting the proposals, perhaps Enterprise Ireland, Fingal County Council or others should deal with this issue.  Does the Minister agree it is time for the authority to address the issues of congestion and capacity at Dublin Airport?</p>
            <p eId="para_886">I welcome the fine new places to be built.  I received a phone call yesterday from a pensioner who had to remove his shoes going through security.  As there was no chair available, he found it extremely difficult to take his shoes off.  These are simple issues the authority could be addressing and is not.  The big plans are very welcome and I support them but somebody else should be dealing with them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_887">I welcome the proposal.  We have had, to some extent, informal development around the airport region and it is interesting to attempt to structure this through the DAA.  Was this proposal part of the business plan put to the Minister by the Dublin Airport Authority with regard to plans for the three airports?</p>
            <p eId="para_888">The Minister mentioned the National Pensions Reserve Fund but has he had any discussions with the new Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance, or with the new Minister for Finance, on the possibility of funding through this area?  Will the Minister be particularly concerned about airport charges?  My colleague has mentioned concerns people have with regard to parking and the massive escalation of charges.  Is there not a suspicion in many airport users and passengers that they will, in effect, end up paying the DAA the seed capital for this massive project?</p>
            <p eId="para_889">The Minister mentioned the indicative completion date for phase I but what is the timeframe for the whole project?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_373" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_890">The first phase is proposed for completion in 2015, with the overall aim to have the project completed by 2033 at the latest.  On the basis of what I have been told, I have no concern that airport charges would be bumped up to pay for this.  This is quite a separate project and would be managed as such.  Funding for the project will be independent of all the capital investment projects they have at the moment.  That is one issue I would insist upon and it is important there is no cross-subsidisation.  Perhaps the Deputy was speaking more about a cross-charge in voicing a fear that airport passengers would be paying for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">I have had no discussions at all with the former Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach, on how we might use the pension funds because, as I indicated in my reply, that is a matter for the National Pensions Reserve Fund itself.  It does not discuss the matter with us or take direction.  It is independent and the law was always specifically provided that it would operate that way precisely because interference was not wanted in case of investment decisions being made on a political rather than financial basis.  I support that.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">With regard to Deputy O'Dowd's points, I absolutely agree the DAA should, as an airport authority, concentrate on its job, do it very well and look after its customers.  In fairness, with increased numbers causing difficult circumstances currently, and particularly over the last number of years before pier D opened, it has done a reasonable job.  I have stated this directly to its representatives and in this House.  However, there is no doubt it has been difficult for customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I agree with the Deputy and one issue I would be particularly focused on is ensuring the DAA does not take its eye off the ball.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_895">It must consider very carefully what is happening but do the job it is meant to.  It has a €2 billion development in terminal 2, the runway etc., and that is to improve the airport for all its customers, both passengers and airlines.  It must concentrate on that project.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The proposed project is fantastic and will have significant value, not just for the immediate area but for the economy as a whole.  The authority is to be commended for its foresight.  It has land available and it is lucky enough in that it is one of the few airports in Europe which has land that can be used for this kind of purpose.  Many airports are totally hindered because of congestion and an inability to expand.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">To give a context to the project, it will cost €4 billion and I hope it will generate approximately 30,000 high quality jobs.  That is not a project which can be just tagged on, with the same people managing the airport and working on the project.  Much project management expertise must be brought it.</p>

            <p eId="para_900">I am glad we agree on something.  Perhaps another point we would agree on is that the authority would address some other issues.  I mentioned a pensioner earlier and his plight is a critical issue for elderly people.  There is also a question of people coming off flights operated for Ryanair, for example, and walking across the apron in front of the terminal, which can be very dangerous.  Concern has been expressed that elderly or confused people — I do not say that in a derogatory sense — could be affected by strange-looking vehicles coming at them sometimes.  It is not good or safe enough and the authority should get its act together.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_379">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_901">When the chief executive, Declan Collier, was in before the Oireachtas transport committee, he indicated the ten-year €2 billion programme referred to by the Minister would leave the DAA with an overhang debt of possibly €1.2 billion.  The Minister has indicated the new project will be totally ring-fenced.  Would he clearly agree this must be the case, given there will still be such an overhang debt?</p>
            <p eId="para_902">The Minister is clearly ploughing ahead with the separation of the three national airports.  When will that happen and has there been an absolutely final decision on Cork and Shannon <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dublin?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_380" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_903">We have not made the decision because, as the Deputy knows, the board in Cork accepted the Cassells recommendations.  Due to the fact that those recommendations are different from the original business plan, that plan was resubmitted to the Dublin Airport Authority.  The latter will then submit the revised plan to me and the Minister for Finance.  We have already agreed, in principle, that we are moving ahead but it will not be until that point that we will actually begin doing so.  When that happens, a particular process must be undergone.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">Commitments were given in respect of local consultations and those at a national level with ICTU.  I have made a proposal to the unions regarding the form the process of consultations might take.  That process will go ahead.  As stated previously — I have no reason to change my view in this regard — provided the business plans are acceptable, it should take nine to 12 months before the three airports are fully separated.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_381" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_906">As the Deputy is aware, as Minister for Transport I am responsible for overall policy and funding issues relating to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  However, the detailed planning, design and implementation of individual road improvement projects, including those carried out by way of public private partnerships, PPPs, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Act 1993.  This includes the carrying out of cost-benefit analyses for such projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">Earlier this year, the Government reviewed the financing arrangements for Transport 21.  As a result, it is now proposed that a number of national road projects, involving a capital expenditure of the order of €1 billion, should be undertaken as unitary payment or non-tolled PPPs.  There will be a corresponding reduction of the order of €1 billion in Exchequer funding for the national roads programme.  The result is that overall funding for the programme, at approximately €18.6 billion, will remain unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The NRA has carried out some initial work to identify a number of projects that could be carried out as unitary payment PPPs.  Significant further analysis remains to be done to definitively determine the full details of such projects.  It is expected that the PPP process will ensure that the projects chosen will be delivered at an earlier stage than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">The NRA carries out exhaustive financial, legal and technical evaluations of the PPP mechanism for national road contracts.  It possesses full value for money and tender evaluation reports for all schemes for which PPP contracts have been awarded.  The NRA is fully committed to facilitating, in as far as is practicable, a thorough examination of the PPP process in order to allow a full value for money assessment to be carried out in regard to national road PPP projects.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are adequate to facilitate parliamentary oversight of PPPs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_382">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_910">I met Mr. Barry, the chief executive of the NRA, a few months ago.  At that stage, the Minister was refusing to approve any further PPPs.  Why has he changed his mind?  I welcome the fact that he is proceeding with a unitary payment system rather than with a concession, which would inevitably have resulted in the imposition of tolls.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">Media reports indicate that two sections of the N20, the N11 Gorey to Enniscorthy route and the N17, Galway to Claremorris route, which are all extremely important, all require work.  Are there any other proposals in respect of this particular tranche of PPPs?</p>
            <p eId="para_912">Why do PPPs not come under the remit of the centre of excellence of the National Development Finance Agency?  Why is the NRA allowed to proceed with PPPs on its own?  International opinion is beginning to be extremely critical of PPPs, particularly in the context that borrowings by a private company will usually be that bit more expensive than those relating to the State sector.  In addition, the private sector can obtain massive rates of return.  One need only consider the ongoing debacle with the M50 and the €600 million the Minister will pay out in the coming years in respect of a project that originally cost approximately £20 million.  Is it not time to engage in a fundamental evaluation of PPPs?  Perhaps it should again be the case that we will not proceed with PPPs unless an important value for money result can be obtained.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, appeared to make some ambitious proposals regarding the cost of land.  The latter has often accounted for 25% of the cost of PPP projects rolled out by the NRA.  Is an in-depth evaluation of PPPs being carried out?  Is such an evaluation not the correct way to proceed?</p>

            <p eId="para_923">Even if it is necessary to spend a little bit more on a PPP, when one balances out the cost over the lifetime of the project, one will see that good value for money is obtained.  When the project has been completed, a road will be in place which would not otherwise have been constructed if one was obliged to wait until the money became available.  If we had not put in place the PPP project, only many of the roads built in recent years would not be in place because we would not have had the money to proceed with their construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">PPPs are used to generate finance.  The reason the roads to which the Deputy refers are being considered in the context of PPPs is in order to release funding for use on public transport projects.  I am sure he would have no difficulty with that.  It is why I wanted to move in this direction.  The roads to which the Deputy refers — two projects on the N20, Cork to Limerick route, the N17, Galway to Claremorris route, and the N11, Gorey to Enniscorthy route incorporating the New Ross bypass — are under consideration in this regard because they are deemed to be most suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The reason tolls will not apply is because it is the considered view of the NRA, based on its experience, that any of the roads it would be reasonable to toll and to obtain a return on are already being tolled.  The NRA has not identified any other road projects which should be the subject of tolls.  The taxpayer will pay for the projects to which the Deputy refers on a unitary payment basis.</p>

         if he has had discussions with the Railway Procurement Agency regarding the planning failure to properly link up the Dublin Docklands Luas and rail stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_928">I do not accept that there has been a planning failure as suggested by the Deputy.  Transport 21 will provide for five additional interchanges for passengers on the Maynooth and west Dublin suburban rail line to which the Deputy's question refers.  These interchange points will be with metro west at Porterstown, the cross-city Luas line at Liffey Junction, metro north at Drumcondra, the Tallaght Luas line at Spencer Dock and the DART interconnector at Pearse Station.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">I understand that the majority of suburban rail services from Maynooth and west Dublin actually serve Connolly Station rather than the new Docklands Station.  There is already a Luas stop at Connolly, which serves passengers wishing to transfer from the Maynooth line to Luas.  The Docklands Luas extension will include a stop at Spencer Dock.  This will be situated approximately 350 metres from Iarnród Éireann's existing station at Docklands and close to the proposed location for a new station for the DART interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The railway order which provided planning permission for the Docklands Luas extension was granted in 2006 and established the route and stop locations on the line.  Construction of the extension is already well under way and is due to be completed next year.  Any change in the route would require a new railway order application, preceded by preparatory planning and design and public consultation.  This would substantially delay completion of the project and significantly increase costs and it is not justified on transport planning grounds.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">My colleague, Deputy Varadkar, raised this issue with the Minister separately in a parliamentary question.  The point he made is that the Government could have provided a valuable terminus in the Docklands by providing a Luas stop at Docklands train station.  This would have provided a direct Luas link from Docklands station to Connolly station, O'Connell Street, Heuston Station and Tallaght, but the proposed Docklands Luas stop is 350 m away from the rail station.  The Minister should revisit this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_934">The reason it did not meet its completion date was that extensive consultation took place, which moved this line further out than was originally intended.  The railway order was obtained for this, which, unfortunately, moves it 350 m from Docklands station.  However, there are plenty of opportunities for people to connect.  The interconnector will come into this particular Luas site.  It is as close as we can go.  It does not impede good transport planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">My Department has recently received a report from Inter-trade Ireland, in association with the Joint Business Council, which addresses key issues and makes recommendations in terms of freight transport, both within and beyond the island of Ireland.  The report is a very comprehensive and substantial document.  The efficient movement of goods is recognised by my Department to be of crucial importance to the Irish economy and our competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">My Department is considering the recommendations in the report.  Key recommendations relate to improving the forecasting of future capacity requirements, improving access to ports and airports, addressing urban congestion, making progress on improving key road corridors and making use of European funded programmes.  In this regard, the all-island dimension to the issues raised is well recognised, as are the possibilities that may present through the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">Pending completion of my Department's analysis of the report, it is too early to respond in any detail to its recommendations.  Nonetheless, I very much welcome the report which will help inform policy development in my Department on the road freight sector.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_406">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_950">I agree it is an important report containing some excellent recommendations.  One simple recommendation it makes is in regard to night-time construction of motorways.  It refers specifically to construction work on road widening, particularly on the M50.  We need to change our ways.  On many occasions roads which are being improved are left abandoned, with nobody working on them in the evenings or on Saturdays or Sundays.  The work only starts when people must get to and from work.  We need a sea change with regard to how we operate.  Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, drive forward this agenda in whatever capacity or with whatever powers he can?</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The third recommendation refers to getting lorries in and out of ports, and specifically to access to Drogheda port, the Cork road system around the Jack Lynch tunnel and the Dublin outer orbital route, which would take pressure off Dublin and improve communications between Drogheda, Navan, Kildare and elsewhere.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_407" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_952">As the Deputy states, it is an important report that puts forward many recommendations and ideas, which we are examining.  On the questions it raises, I am aware of all the points the Deputy highlights from the report in regard to port access at Drogheda, the road system in Cork and the Dublin outer orbital route.  The Deputy will be aware that the National Roads Authority is examining the outer orbital route and assessing the possibility of advancing it, at least to design stage, as quickly as possible.  It is not included in Transport 21.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">With regard to port access, this report will be taken in conjunction with the official report on ports policy that was published some years ago.  This is a useful addition to that report.  We will carefully note its contents and respond in due course.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_408">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_954">Reference is made in the report to the national traffic information system that operates in the midlands of the UK.  Is this something we could replicate?  While the local authorities do their best, should we have some type of national system, particularly for road freight?</p>
            <p eId="para_955">There is a recommendation regarding the Leinster orbital route which will run from Drogheda, through Navan in the Minister's heartland and, we hope, on towards Arklow and Gorey.  What stage is that project at in terms of finance and preparation?</p>
            <p eId="para_956">As he is set to continue in charge of the Department, does the Minister intend to take any initiative on rail freight, given that we have such an appalling performance in international and EU terms?  Much more could be done in this regard.  Will the Minister take some initiative, even a fiscal one, in next year's budget?</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_957">Rail freight is an issue that has raised its head in recent years and we are considering it in the context of the sustainable travel and transport action plan.  To be honest with the Deputy, I had a number of discussions with Iarnród Éireann on the matter.  It made efforts some years ago to increase the level of rail freight but these efforts were not successful.  It is not a convenient way of carrying much of the freight in Ireland.  However, with the price of petrol and diesel reaching $120 per barrel, the position might change.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">Freight transport by rail is not quite as simple as it is on the Continent, where one can send freight by rail over very long distances and through various countries.  The problem in Ireland is that it is not sufficiently convenient or economical to transport freight by rail, with the exception of freight that comes in vast quantities.  I hope this will change and if I can do anything to promote rail freight under the sustainable travel and transport plan, I will be delighted to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The outer orbital route or Leinster orbital route is under consideration but is not included in Transport 21.  No funding has been arranged for it.  It will obviously form part of the review of Transport 21 in 2010 and 2011.  The national tracking system is worthwhile.  The NRA is doing some work on it in respect of real-time information.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Deputy O'Dowd referred to roadworks and road widening at night.  I accept that nobody wants that in built-up residential areas but it should be the norm elsewhere.  I have said before in the House that I do not approve of restrictions to planning permissions to the effect that people can only work for six or seven hours in the middle of the day.  We must get real about such matters.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_973">I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, on his appointment.  We will lose him from one of our committees, which he chaired expertly.  I wish him well.  I hoped this matter would have been deemed important enough for the Minister for Health and Children to attend, but she decided not to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The dispute involving the psychiatric nurses is serious and it affects the most vulnerable people, namely the psychiatric patients in hospital and in the community.  Any diminution of service has an effect and the diminution in question is considerable.  It is feared that the trend will continue.  We urge the Minister, the HSE and the unions to make every effort tomorrow with the Labour Relations Commission to find a solution to the crisis affecting psychiatric services.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">Assaults of varying degrees have been a fact of life for psychiatric nurses for a long time.  In 2002 the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, carried out research on the number of assaults on psychiatric nurses in 2001 and found that 857 had been injured by assault.  On making this finding, the PNA wrote to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stating that the frequency of the assaults in psychiatric services can, in most instances, be attributed to the mental health of the patients.  The letter states that the perpetrator of the assault is, quite often, suffering from an illness such that, if charged with a serious criminal offence, there would be a finding of insanity or diminished responsibility.  There was no response by the Minister and the PNA balloted members on industrial action.  However, on the eve of the action, the Minister intervened and set up a taskforce on assaults on psychiatric nurses.  The Minister gave a written assurance that the findings and recommendations of the taskforce would be accepted and progressed within an agreed timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">The taskforce reported in April 2003 and the report contained a recommendation for the establishment of a no-fault, non-statutory compensation scheme for nurses working in mental health services who suffer serious injury as a result of an assault.  It defined "injury" as "any serious impairment of the person's physical or mental condition".  It provided for retrospective compensation for nurses previously injured by assault.  The PNA accepted the recommendations of the taskforce but, despite several demands, there was no sign of the scheme being implemented by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">The Government considered the matter at its Cabinet meeting on 13 July 2005.  The then Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, met the PNA that evening and said that, despite the Government's previous undertakings, the Government had decided not to implement the scheme.  She stated she was asking the State Claims Agency to consider the introduction of a fixed redress scheme along the lines of the PIAB scheme that would expressly prohibit any compensation for psychological trauma and would not cover any injuries incurred before the introduction of the scheme.  This was contrary to the recommendations of the taskforce and to the undertaking of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The PNA was adamant that psychological trauma and retrospection should be part of the scheme.  However, it decided it would be prudent to allow the Government to approve the scheme as the principle of no-fault compensation at least would be established.  The Government subsequently approved the scheme at a Cabinet meeting on 17 January 2007.  The PNA immediately referred the matter to the Labour Court and sourced legal and medical expert opinion.  The Labour Court in its recommendation upheld the PNA claim.  It stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_979">The Court accordingly recommends that an insurance-based scheme be put in place to take effect from the date of this Recommendation, which should include an element of compensation for psychological trauma, where relevant, and where it arises directly from the effects of an assault on a nurse while at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The Labour Court's understanding is that there are approximately 40 such claims already lodged in the system. In the case of these claims and no other, the court recommended that the terms of the proposed new scheme be extended to embrace those claimants on a once-off basis.  Following the recommendation from the court, the Department went back to the various Departments involved, particularly the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General for advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Following repeated requests to the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and HSE-Employers Agency, the union was informed that the Department of Health and Children had completed its consultations early this year and that a revised scheme to incorporate the findings of the Labour Court was presented to the Minister for  Health and Children, Deputy Harney on 3 January 2008.  The PNA issued a press release describing the scheme as  being "Yellow pack in the extreme".</p>
            <p eId="para_982">As of yesterday evening the delivery of services has been upset to a considerable degree.  Various problems have arisen in County Kildare and the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, where there has been a proposal that soldiers and gardaí should take over nursing duties.  While I hope this was never considered, a newspaper reported that this was the case.  A staffing crisis that arose before noon in County Kildare was averted until 5 p.m.  Problems exist in St. Ita's, Portrane, Tallaght hospital and in the mental health services in Clonmel and counties Clare, Monaghan and Cavan.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_418">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_983">I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue and for his good wishes.  I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">In 2002, a task force was established to investigate assaults on psychiatric nurses with a view to exploring preventive measures to reduce the incidence of assault and to provide for a compensation scheme for the nurses concerned.  The task force reported in April 2003.  It recommended the introduction of a no fault, non-statutory compensation scheme for those nurses working in the mental health services who are seriously injured as a result of an assault by patients during the course of their duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">On 13 July 2005 the Government decided, in the light of advice received from the Attorney General, that it was neither feasible nor practical to proceed with the introduction of a no fault compensation scheme as recommended by the task force.  The Minister for Health and Children met officials from SIPTU and the PNA on 13 July 2005 and advised both unions of the Government decision.  However, the Minister confirmed that consideration would be given to the idea of a fixed and proportionate redress fund for physical injuries as an add-on to the serious physical assault scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">Following from this, the Labour Court recommendation dated 29 March 2007 and subsequent clarification, the HSE introduced an insurance scheme to provide compensation for nurses in the mental health services assaulted by a patient or client in the course of their employment.  This insurance scheme is modelled on standard personal accident insurance cover and will provide a fixed tariff of compensation for particular physical injuries resulting from assault by a patient.  It would be in addition to the existing serious physical assault scheme, which provides for enhanced sick pay and cover for medical expenses, as well as five sixths of salary for nurses permanently incapacitated as a result of a serious assault at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">It also should be noted that premiums due for the personal injury insurance cover are paid for by the HSE and no charge is incurred by individual nurses.  The policy commenced on Monday, 21 January 2008 and is in line with industry norms in respect of insurance-based schemes that are available to other sectors of the economy.  Both the PNA and SIPTU have rejected the scheme and have argued that any benefit should be reflective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, book of quantum.  However, the cover provided is an insurance-based scheme which never was intended to compensate persons at levels equivalent to the PIAB or the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The PIAB assesses claims for compensation only in circumstances in which the negligent party, whether employer or otherwise, acknowledges fault.  The PIAB compensation is based on the equivalent compensation that a person could expect to be awarded by a judge of the Circuit Court or High Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Following 21 days' notice, the PNA and SIPTU commenced a work to rule on 30 April, which includes a ban on overtime whereby psychiatric nurses will work rostered hours only; no co-operation with assisted admission; no escorting of patients to mental health tribunals; and no attendance at non-essential meetings.  The HSE invited the PNA and SIPTU to talks yesterday, 7 May, to discuss issues relating to contingency plans, continuity of service and emergency cover for the ongoing dispute.  Both unions declined to attend.  This non-attendance, combined with the failure to notify the HSE of their non-attendance, raises serious questions about the commitment of union leadership to patient safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">Meanwhile, as a consequence of the ongoing PNA-SIPTU industrial action, the position in Lakeview acute mental health unit at Naas General Hospital has reached critical point.  There have been significant ongoing difficulties in staffing the Lakeview unit.  However, due to uncertainty regarding the ability to deliver continuity of care in a safe environment, a decision has been made to transfer immediately patients to other treatment facilities.  This is a regrettable step but is unavoidable at present and has been taken in the best interest of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">As for claims concerning the Central Mental Hospital, the hospital remains open.  Management of the HSE has met both unions locally and is managing the situation on a daily basis.  It should be noted that staff from all disciplines and management have worked tirelessly to protect patient care since the dispute started last Wednesday.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">The Labour Relations Commission, LRC, has formally invited the parties to the current dispute for exploratory talks on Friday at noon.  This invitation is on an unconditional basis and all parties have accepted this invitation.  The Minister has welcomed the initiative by the LRC.  She has expressed her deep concern at the adverse impact of the dispute on the care of mental health patients and has appealed to the two nursing unions involved to suspend their industrial action to minimise hardship to service users and their families while the talks process at the LRC gets under way.</p>

          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_419">
            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_993">I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on his appointment.  However, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was in the House earlier to answer oral questions and I had expected he would remain for this transport-related question on the Adjournment, which pertains to a highly important issue facing Shannon Airport.  It is typical of the Minister for Transport to run away.  He ran away from the Heathrow service issue when it arose last September and he has run away this afternoon.  He should have spared five minutes for Shannon Airport.  Things do not really change and this is more of the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter in the House.  When the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, signed the EU-US open skies agreement, he promised that the introduction of open skies would herald the beginning of a new era of opportunities for Irish airports, including Shannon, to exploit the US aviation market.  He promised that pre-immigration clearance would be up and running at an early date and would give Shannon Airport an economic advantage.  He also stated he was putting the final touches on a major tourism and economic plan for the Shannon region to cushion the blow.  However, the ink was hardly dry on the agreement when the promises made to Shannon Airport evaporated one by one.  The last Aer Lingus flight took off from the tarmac at Shannon for Heathrow on 13 January last with the region's slots on board.  A total of €20 million was erased from the tourism and economic plan without objection and now the unique advantage possessed by Shannon in respect of its extension to its US Customs and Border Protection facility is being whittled away by a lacklustre Government that is showing no urgency in introducing legislation to give effect to this development at Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The Government's legislative programme for summer 2008 provides no indication of when the proposed air navigation and transport pre-clearance Bill will be published.  I urge the Minister of State to put pressure on his colleague, the Minister for Transport, to bring forward this legislation.  I have raised this issue a number of times and have been informed that negotiations are ongoing.  It seems extraordinary, therefore, that while there have been many high profile visits to the US in recent months by the former Taoiseach, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport, none of them bothered to discuss this matter with their US counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">When I had the opportunity to meet the US Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, last November in Dublin, I raised this issue with him.  He was highly supportive of this project and my understanding is that while the US authorities are behind this development, the Irish Government and Department of Transport are dragging their heels in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Shannon Airport can only avail of opportunities in an open skies environment if it is in a position to exploit its advantages.  The airport authority is striving to secure year-round transatlantic services and has introduced a three-year winter transatlantic incentive scheme.  The airport also faces concerns following Ryanair's threat issued this week that while an agreement is in place with Shannon Airport until 2010, there are no guarantees beyond this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">Tourism interests in the west of Ireland in conjunction with Tourism Ireland recently launched the Discover Ireland's Wonderful West campaign in the United States.  If the Government is serious about supporting this campaign, the success of which depends on full customs and agriculture pre-clearance, such pre-clearance should be in place.  Full pre-clearance would allow passengers to be treated as domestic passengers on their arrival in the US.  New services from Shannon to the US could be developed.  Other airlines would be attracted to use the airport as a hub for their services to the US from destinations throughout Europe and there is huge potential to expand the airport's corporate jet business. This facility is essential if Shannon Airport is to cope with the negative effects of the Open Skies agreement.  There was a 4% decrease in Shannon's transatlantic services in 2007.  This trend is set to continue this year, as a further decline is predicted.  Some 65 US companies, directly providing 11,000 jobs, are located in the mid-west region.  Almost two out of every three foreign direct investment projects coming to Ireland in 2007 originated in the US.  American firms contributed over €2.5 billion to the Irish tax coffers in that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The Dublin Airport Authority announced last week that a new city is to be developed at Dublin Airport.  My colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, raised the matter earlier during Question Time.  It is claimed that the project represents a blueprint for the next generation of foreign investment in this country.  The significant shift in US tourism and business from the west of this country to the east will continue if the Government does not devise radical national policies to stem this tide.  I am afraid, however, that there is no King Canute in the Government who will to push back the tide for Shannon.  There is nobody with new ideas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The global airline and aviation industry is experiencing a period of severe turbulence.  Four airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the US in recent weeks.  Industry sources predict that travellers will see little immediate benefit from the Open Skies Agreement, due to the current turmoil in the US economy.  Nevertheless, the same sources are predicting that a wider range of low-cost, business-class and other carriers will operate on expanded transatlantic routes in the future.  If Shannon is to be in a position to compete for its share of this business, full pre-clearance must in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">Government inaction is hampering Shannon Airport.  I urge the Minister for Transport to introduce legislation so that this project, the original deadline for which was 1 May, can get under way.  How many more deadlines will have passed before it is introduced?  There is a suspicion that agreement is being delayed to allow Dublin Airport to introduce the facility at the same time as Shannon Airport, thereby ending any competitive advantage Shannon might have had.  This is not acceptable.  I urge the Minister to expedite this agreement.  Shannon needs this facility.  The airport is ready for it.  However, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his Government colleagues are stalling.</p>

            <p eId="para_1003">The Minister for Transport does not accept that there is any undue delay in legislating for pre-clearance at Shannon Airport.  Negotiations with the United States need to be concluded before legislation providing for such a facility can be drafted.  Under the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport (Pre-Inspection) Act 1986, Ireland has an agreement with the United States whereby all US-bound passengers departing from Shannon and Dublin airports are eligible for pre-inspection by the US authorities before departure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Pre-inspection is the procedure whereby personnel from the US customs and border protection body, which is a division of the US Department of Homeland Security, carry out those inspections of passengers and aircraft crew that are required under US immigration and public health laws and regulations for entry to that country.  Under the 1986 Act, the procedures are confined to immigration clearance only — they do not include inspections that are required under other US laws and regulations, such as agriculture and customs inspections.  Pre-clearance is the process whereby all inspection and clearance requirements under US law for passengers arriving into the US are met at the departure airport.  Passengers arriving at US airports are then processed without any further official contact.  On arrival at the US airport, they have a status similar to that of passengers arriving from other US airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">There would be benefits if pre-clearance facilities were introduced in Ireland.  Passengers would be processed through all US entry procedures before they travel, knowing that when they arrive at their destination airport in the US they will enjoy an uninterrupted passage.  Airlines would be able to use the less congested domestic airports or domestic terminals of international airports on arrival in the US.  If pre-clearance facilities were available, Shannon Airport Authority would be able to market Shannon Airport as a hub for US-bound flights.  Any attempt to move to a pre-clearance regime will require the negotiation of a pre-clearance agreement with the US.  That agreement would have to be incorporated into Irish domestic law to enable pre-clearance operations to take place on Irish soil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The proposals of the US authorities for the provision of pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports were submitted to the Department of Transport in late December 2007.  Formal negotiations on the proposals with the US authorities commenced in January of this year.  During his visit to Washington last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, met the US Secretary of Homeland Security, Mr. Michael Chertoff, to discuss progress on the negotiations.  While the content of the discussions must remain confidential, the Minister is looking forward to making good progress with the US authorities.  As the matter is under negotiation, it is too early to say when the necessary intergovernmental agreement will be finalised and legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas.  However, subject to Government approval, the Minister for Transport is targetting the end of year for the agreement and the legislation to be in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">I would like to highlight a major issue which has arisen in Drogheda.  It was recently announced that the special needs unit attached to Marymount national school in the Ballsgrove area of the town will be unable to take new students from the end of this year.  For a number of years the unit's teachers and special needs assistants have looked after extremely well five young people with special needs — there were six pupils there until quite recently.  As the children move into the secondary system, their parents are becoming concerned.  The special needs unit was established with the aim of integrating children with special needs into the ordinary environment in which all students are taught.  It has worked extremely well.  Five of the special needs students will be making their confirmation shortly.  They are participating fully in the celebrations, for example by participating in music and mime.  The parents of these children, as well as representatives of various organisations involved in this sector, are outraged that other young people in the Drogheda area and the surrounding districts in counties Meath and Louth will be unable to avail of the services of the unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Who is responsible for this closure?  I have been informed that the powers that be, who are not necessarily based in the Department of Education and Science, do not intend to continue with the experiment of integrating special needs students in the local primary school.  A great deal of concern has been expressed about this decision at local level.  It has been the subject of an editorial in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>.  I await the Minister of State’s response.  I hope it will be as good as the response I would give him if the position were reversed.  In other words, I would make sure that the unit would stay open.</p>

            <p eId="para_1011">I thank Deputy O'Dowd for his kind remarks.  I am pleased to have been given an opportunity to clarify the position in respect of the special needs class at Marymount national school, which had an enrolment of 422 pupils on 30 September 2007.  The school's current staff comprises a principal teacher, 15 mainstream class teachers, a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post, five learning support and resource teaching posts, two special class teaching posts, a resource teacher for Travellers, a home school liaison post, three urban band teaching posts and five temporary language support teaching posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The organisers approve the establishment of special classes where a need has been determined.  I understand that officials from the Department of Education and Science have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education about the special needs class in Marymount national school.  It seems that a significant number of children enrolled in the special class will move to post-primary education in September.  I am informed that the local special educational needs organiser is actively involved in discussions with the school authorities and local HSE officials regarding the future of the special class.  A decision has yet to be taken.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1014">I would like to mention two environmental issues relating to the town of Youghal in east Cork.  One of the beaches in the town was the subject of an unfavourable report yesterday.  I understand that until quite recently, the water quality at the beach was found to be excellent.  It passed all the tests because it was top class.  However, it failed one of the ten tests which were undertaken over a period of time on 17 July 2007.  I understand there were exceptional circumstances on the day in question.  It seems that heavy rainfall may have resulted in effluent being washed into the sea.  The beach failed one of the tests as a result.  Perhaps the matter could be reconsidered — the beach could be tested again — in light of the exceptional circumstances which prevailed on the day in question.  The report brought out this week relates to 17 July of last year.  The beach was closed at the time.  When the water quality was tested afterwards, it was found to be okay.  We need to examine all these matters because they just do not add up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">It is unfair that such a poor reflection of Youghal is being portrayed.  The treatment plant being developed in the town was supposed to have been up and running in 2007, but that has not happened yet.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure the project is completed as quickly as possible.  Youghal is a beautiful tourist town in a scenic area.  We do not want any further delays.  The development needs to be pursued vigorously.  The Department should ensure there are no delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The second environmental issue relates to the landfill site in Youghal, the only facility of that nature in the south Cork area.  Those living in the area have complained to me about the noxious smells in the locality.  The smell from the landfill site is causing them to wake as early as 6 a.m., even though their windows are closed.  That is not good enough.  I have been speaking to representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, who are doing their best, and to the council, but more needs to be done.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, was written to last June about this matter but he said that he has no role to play and that it is up to the EPA.  It is not right that people in Youghal cannot go about their business.  They are taxpayers, yet they must put up with this foul, nauseating odour.  It is not a case of saying "Not in my back yard" because they do not mind having the landfill there provided resources are put in place to run it properly.  The EPA, the council and the Minister should do their jobs.  I am representing my constituents in this matter which is unfair to them.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree with me if he could not sleep at night, even with the windows closed, because he was living near such a landfill site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">I am worried about the onset of summer because warmer weather will create more foul conditions from the sludge at the landfill site.  Last summer, flies swarmed into houses from that site, which posed a health risk.  The Minister of State should re-examine the matter to see what can be done about it.  The situation is having a really negative impact on local people's health and quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">I ask the Minister of State to investigate water quality at the local beach, which was found to be polluted.  A treatment plant is urgently required.  He should also examine the regime in place for testing water quality.  Noxious odours emanating from the waste treatment plant and another facility need to be put right.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">I am taking this item on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">The landfill site at Foxhole is operated by Cork County Council and, in accordance with the Waste Management Acts, is licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency.  This licensing system is intended to ensure that high standards of environmental protection apply to the operation of such facilities.  It also precludes the EPA from issuing a licence unless it is satisfied that, among other things, emissions from the activity concerned will not contravene any relevant standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">The licence granted for this landfill lays down strict conditions regarding the operation of the site, including dealing with matters such as environmental nuisances from dust and odours.  The enforcement of the conditions attached to the licence is a matter for the EPA's office of environmental enforcement.  Under the Waste Management Acts the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control concerning the performance by the EPA of its functions in particular circumstances.  However, I understand that in the past 12 months Cork County Council has been taking measures to address the issue of odours at the site, including: the introduction of an odour neutralising system on a trial basis since March 2008; and the provision of gas extraction wells in active cells, thereby allowing the landfill gas to be drawn out and flared with a subsequent reduction in odour problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">In addition, an intensive study, instigated by the EPA, is under way on the landfill gas management system.  Fast-tracking the capping off of particular active cells at the site is a priority for the council with a view to ensuring that this problem is resolved as speedily as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">As regards the issue of bathing water quality, the Minister is disappointed that Youghal strand failed to meet the mandatory EU standard.  It is, of course, a matter for the local authority to ensure that bathing water quality standards are met and maintained.  The report by the EPA on bathing water quality for 2007, which was published this week, indicated that Youghal strand was one of four bathing water areas that failed to meet the minimum standard.  I understand that it failed because of the presence of faecal coliforms in excess of the limit laid down in the bathing water regulations.  This is particularly disappointing because in 2006 Youghal strand met the higher guide standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The EPA's office of environmental enforcement provides advice and guidance to local authorities on environmental protection activities.  The office also audits the performance of local authorities and, where necessary, issues legally binding directions.  I understand that the office has been following up the issue regarding Youghal strand with Cork County Council.  It is worth pointing out that in this case one sample out of ten taken failed to meet the standard.  This is sufficient to fail overall.  I am aware that Cork County Council has investigated the possible reasons for the failure and has previously carried out remedial works at a nearby pumping station.  The EPA points out that the unusually high rainfall last summer would have been a factor in the failure of certain bathing areas to achieve the required standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">More generally, it is good that the overall situation regarding the quality of our bathing water remains pristine with 97%, or 127 out of 131 bathing areas, complying with the mandatory standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">As regards the Department's water services investment programme, Youghal, together with nearby Claycastle, will be incorporated into the Youghal sewerage scheme at an estimated cost of €14.42 million.  I understand that Cork County Council is preparing to appoint consultants to develop the contract documents for the scheme.  The council should be in a position to submit the contract documents to the Department for approval next year, with construction on the scheme due to start in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1031">Section 54 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 provides for the establishment of an Advisory Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation, consisting of an independent chairperson and 17 ordinary members.  It provides for the appointment of at least four persons representing small public service vehicle and driver interests, one person each from local authorities and An Garda Síochana, at least two persons representing consumer interests, and at least one person each representing disability, business and tourism interests.  The Minister also has power to appoint four persons who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Commission or the Council.  The role of the Council is to advise the Commission for Taxi Regulation and the Minister for Transport, as appropriate, in relation to issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">The current Advisory Council was appointed in accordance with the membership structure set out in the 2003 Act.  Nominations from a range of interests were considered when decisions on the Council's membership were being made.  Six members of the Council have a background in the industry.  The term of appointment of the current members of the Council will expire on 3 November 2009.  There is currently a vacancy for one ordinary member on the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">I am satisfied that the current composition of the Advisory Council adequately reflects the representational structure envisaged under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and that there is an appropriate balance between the interests of small public service vehicle owners and drivers on the one hand and the consumer and public interests on the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_1037">The Road Safety Strategy 2007 to 2012, approved by the Government in October 2007, identifies the need to legislate for and introduce a reduction in the legal Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) for drivers, but does not specify what that level should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">In determining what the BAC limit should be reduced to, the advice of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) was sought. The RSA's recommendations have been received and the Government, in noting the contents of the Authority's report at last week's Cabinet meeting, agreed that the RSA's report be published and taken into account in preparing new road traffic legislation this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1045">My primary focus at this stage is to obtain details from insurers of vehicles that have been written off in recent years for comparison against the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and to determine the extent to which written off vehicles may still be in circulation. I can report that, with the assistance of the Irish Insurance Federation, the insurance industry has agreed to make the necessary data available voluntarily. I expect that the process of obtaining this information and validating it against the NVDF will be completed over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">As a first significant step, data relating to some 5,400 written off vehicles which has already been provided voluntarily to my Department by one major insurer has been analysed against the 2.4 million active vehicles on the NVDF.  The analysis revealed activity on the NVDF file after the date of write off in respect of a relatively small number of vehicles and the Department has written in recent days to the registered owners of some 261 vehicles which the records indicate may still be in use on public roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">I am also committed to establishing a framework going forward so that there is an effective system in place which ensures that all write off instances are notified to my Department and properly recorded. My Department has been informed of the deliberations of an informal review group established to examine this issue chaired by the RSA and representative of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda Siochana, and the NVDF. Further consultation with relevant stakeholders is required. This element, which could involve introducing a voluntary code of practice for all concerned, will be progressed when the verification exercise for all insurance write off data against the NVDF is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">The alleged importation of write offs from abroad is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the registration of vehicles. Discussions are currently in progress between that Office and my Department in relation to possible arrangements for noting NVDF records of the write off status of imported vehicles where that information is available at the time of registration.</p>

The prioritisation was influenced by a number of relevant studies carried out in the years leading up to the launch such as the National Road Needs Study, the Strategic Rail Review and the DTO Strategy document ‘A Platform for Change'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">The Government has committed to the overall funding for Transport 21 over its ten-year life to 2015.  The Exchequer element of the funding is provided through the normal annual budget and estimates exercise.  For the first three years of Transport 21, the capital funding provided is in line with the originally agreed profile of expenditure.  I have no reason to believe that the funding requirement for the remaining years of Transport 21 will not be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1092">The primary responsibility for the compliance with the law on board ships rests with the flag state in each case.

            <p eId="para_1093">The payment of wages on foreign flagged ships is a matter for the flag state where the ship is registered and is a matter for the internal domestic law of that country. However, Ireland does carry out inspections onboard foreign flagged ships in Irish ports under the auspices of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port state control and EU directives. These inspections are carried out to check for compliance with international law. Surveyors from my Department inspect over 400 such foreign flagged ships per year and they detain any ship which poses a safety hazard or which does not comply with the international requirements on living and working arrangements. The number of ships detained in the years mentioned are 2005 twenty-one ships, in 2006 twenty-six ships, in 2007 twenty-four ships and so far in 2008 eight ships have been detained.    However, non-payment of wages is not in itself a basis for detention by inspectors of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1101">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.  The Dublin Transport Authority Bill has been published and has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The DTA Bill sets out the mechanisms for the award of contracts for subvention in line with the new regime introduced under the new EU Regulation on Public Service Obligations in the transport sector, which will become mandatory from next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1104">It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals to be contained in a Public Transport Regulation Bill.  At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that the new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  The new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU PSO Regulation.  It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, and that the powers to grant licences in the Greater Dublin Area will be given to the Dublin Transport Authority.  The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area that are consistent with the EU PSO Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">The Government has also committed to examining the need for a National Transport Regulator in the context of the overall review of the economic regulatory environment.  This review is being progressed on an inter-departmental basis under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>

            <p eId="para_1147">The primary responsibility for the safety of a ship rests with the operating company and with the state in which the ship is registered, the flag state. A second line of defence exists whereby the state in which the ship is located, the port state, has the entitlement to carry out inspections. This entitlement to carry out port state control inspections can only ever be on a sampling basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">In Ireland port state control inspections on foreign flagged ships are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control and EU Directives. The requirement is to inspect 25% of all foreign flagged ships visiting Irish ports each year. Surveyors from my Department inspect over 400 such ships each year, which is in excess of the 25% inspection commitment. Additionally, Ireland inspects all foreign flagged roll-on roll-off passenger ferries operating on international voyages to and from Ireland; these inspections include both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. Ireland fully meets its commitment in this regard as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">The recent tragedy on board the ro-ro passenger ferry the "M/V Dublin Viking" yet again highlights the importance of safe mooring procedures and safety management systems on board ships. As this ship is registered in the United Kingdom, they as flag state have the primary role in ensuring that the ship is operated safely and they certify the management company as capable of doing so. Ireland as the port state is obliged under international treaties to accept such certification as prima facie evidence that the ship is compliant unless there are clear grounds for concluding otherwise.  My Department is in the process of recruiting additional surveyors to assist in this work from 2009 onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">The provision, improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  A national Pavement Condition Study of the regional and local road network was carried out in 1996 and a second Pavement Condition Study of the network was completed in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">On foot of the findings of the second study, grants available to county councils under the pavement restoration programme for restoration improvement and restoration maintenance works have been significantly increased in recent years.

            <p eId="para_1160">My Department monitors the cost of works undertaken by local authorities under the pavement restoration programme.  Increased cost of surface dressing maintenance works in recent years can be attributed to a range of factors including increased cost of oil and bitumen, greater use of higher grade bitumen to cater for higher traffic flows, increased cost of chippings and other materials, higher plant hire costs, wage increases and additional health and safety requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1163">Transport 21 represents the largest capital investment commitment ever made by Government to the development of transport infrastructure in this country.  The projects comprising Transport 21 will greatly improve our national roads and public transport system over the ten year period to 2015, involving a total investment of €34 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">Recent market research undertaken on behalf of my Department indicated that awareness levels of Transport 21 among the general public are low.  Given the scale of Transport 21 I consider it essential that the general public and all interested parties are made aware of the programme and of the many transport improvements that are already being delivered.  It is also important because of the disruption caused by many projects that the public are fully informed of the purpose of each project and the long term benefits which will accrue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">Therefore, as part of a wider information and communications strategy and following a public procurement process, my Department engaged the services of consultants to undertake a media advertising campaign to raise public awareness of Transport 21.  The campaign involves television, radio, press and outdoor advertising and I envisage that it will be necessary to continue to provide information and awareness to the public and all interested parties for the duration of Transport 21.  The budget allocated for the advertising campaign for 2008 is €2.9 million.  The consultants have been engaged for a three-year period and further campaigns are planned for 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">The overall objective of the campaign is to make the general public aware of the projects and programmes contained in Transport 21 and the benefits that will accrue from their implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">As I have stated previously, I believe that the projected completion dates and budgets for Transport 21 projects will be determined only when the projects have gone through (i) public consultation, (ii) the relevant statutory approvals processes and (iii) the procurement and contract award process. Full project costs will be made available when (i) all procurement processes related to the project have been completed and contracts awarded and (ii) robust estimates are available in relation to non-contract elements of the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1219">Mr. Tom Mulcahy was appointed by my predecessor as Chairperson-designate of the Dublin Transport Authority (DTA). I will shortly be appointing the other members of an interim Authority that will be tasked with putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that the Authority will be in a position to commence work immediately following its formal establishment. The priority in this regard will be the recruitment of a Chief Executive-designate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">My Department will provide up to €4 million from existing resources in the current year to the interim Authority for this purpose. The interim Authority will identify the Authority's administrative budget and staffing requirements for 2009 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">The Government decided that the Railway Procurement Agency should not be absorbed by the new Authority in order to remove any possible risk to the successful completion of the ongoing procurement process in respect of Metro North. The Government also decided that the Commission for Taxi Regulation should be absorbed by the new Authority and my Department is preparing the necessary amendments to the Dublin Transport Authority Bill for this purpose. Those amendments will be tabled at Dáil Committee Stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">The DTA will have overall responsibility for the implementation of Transport 21 in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), working as far as possible through the existing agencies as set out in Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Bill. While the National Roads Authority (NRA) will continue to exercise national road functions in the GDA, it will be required to do so in a manner that is consistent with the DTA's transport strategy. The DTA will also have the power to require the NRA to exercise its functions in a manner that is consistent with the transport strategy as well as other specified plans and measures. Where necessary, the DTA will also be empowered to step-in and perform those functions itself.  These powers are detailed in Chapter 6 of Part 4 of the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_1226">The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has given me comprehensive proposals for the registration and regulation of driving instructors, with a target operational date of 1 January 2009.  The RSA's proposals followed on from extensive consultations it has engaged in with the driving instructor sector since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The proposals provide, inter alia, that the RSA may exempt a person from having to undertake one or more of the three required qualification tests for accreditation as an approved driving instructor, where it can be demonstrated that he or she meets the standard for the particular qualification test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The RSA has administrative and testing arrangements in place to enable it to process applications from persons seeking accreditation as approved driving instructors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">Standards in driving instruction are an important element in the overall road safety agenda, particularly in relation to providing quality instruction for learner drivers, and this is recognised in the Road Safety Strategy 2006-2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">The National Development Plan provides for a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy. My Department is in the process of recruiting consultants to help carry out the study. It is hoped to have the study completed within a six-month period. In October 2007, Dublin City Council published for public consultation a wide-ranging study of economic, amenity, recreational and environmental issues linked to Dublin Bay, including the port area. I am familiar with that study and I understand that the outcome of the consultation will be reported back to the Council. The study of the port under the NDP will take account of the findings of Dublin City Council's work. Dublin Port is a vital piece of economic infrastructure. In tonnage terms, it handles roughly 40% of the seaborne trade in and out of the State. In value terms it is even more significant. In 2006 it handled 79% of the State's RoRo traffic and 62% of the container traffic. Clearly, the future role of Dublin Port is of major strategic importance to the country. It is much more than a local or regional issue and requires further examination at a strategic level. The study of the port under the NDP will provide this strategic level examination.</p>

            <p eId="para_1314">I met the Chairman of Shannon Foynes Port Company on 3 March 2008. I have also been in correspondence with the Company over the past year. Department officials have represented me at the 2007 Annual General Meeting of the company on 10 July 2007 and the 2008 AGM on 2 May 2008. Officials have also had a number of meetings with the company over the past year. On 23 April last, in advance of the 2008 AGM, my Department met with the interim CEO of the company and the vice Chairman of the company. In 2006 and 2007 the company was party to a number of related legal disputes. In October 2007, an out of court settlement was reached between the parties. Following the settlement, my Department considered the financial position of the company and has further reviewed the accounts for 2007 in the context of the recent AGM. This has provided some reassurance that the company is addressing its financial difficulties, while continuing to operate and develop the business. My Department will continue to closely monitor the financial situation of the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_1326">Statutory Instrument 26/04/1924: Regulations by the Minister of Finance Under Section 9 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924 provided, <i>inter ali</i>a, that female Civil Servants holding established posts would be required on marriage to resign from the Civil Service. The Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973 provided for the repeal of certain statutory provisions restricting the employment of married women in the Civil Service, including the repeal of Section 10 requiring women to retire on marriage. The marriage bar applied to female primary school teachers. All female teachers who entered teaching service on or after 1 October 1934 had to retire on marriage.  The only exception to this was in the case of women who had completed their teacher training course before that date but had not been appointed to a permanent teaching position until on or after that date.  The marriage bar was removed for primary school teachers on 30 June 1958. I am not aware of any Constitutional challenges having been taken as a result of the marriage bar. In the Civil Service the superannuation scheme was non-contributory for women in the period in question, so therefore the issue of repayment of contributions does not arise.  Women who were compulsorily retired on marriage could, in certain circumstances, qualify for a marriage gratuity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1430">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the growing of energy crops such as miscanthus (elephant grass) and willow, for example, is regarded as crop husbandry. As such it is treated as farming for tax purposes. The crops in question are generally  perennials which are harvested on a regular basis to provide bio-fuels. The initial cost of planting the root stock of these perennials is treated in tax law as capital expenditure. No deduction is, therefore, allowed for tax purposes. All expenditure subsequent to the initial planting is deductible as a trading expense. This tax treatment is in line with the tax treatment of other perennial crops such as nursery plants and fruit trees. I understand that grant aid is payable on 50% of the approved costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow crops for biomass. The cost of establishment is estimated at €2,900 per hectare, giving a maximum grant payment amount of up to €1,450 per hectare.</p>

Departments and Offices can also obtain a recruitment licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments for this purpose. In considering someone for appointment to the Civil Service, the licence holder must evaluate suitability in all respects.  This includes suitability on grounds of character which would encompass such matters as criminal convictions.  In addressing the issue of a criminal conviction, the licence holder would have regard to such matters as:</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">the nature and sensitivity of the post being filled,</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">the classification of the offence,</p>

Candidates are afforded the opportunity to complete a Health and Character Declaration during the recruitment process. This affords candidates the opportunity to bring all relevant matters to the attention of their potential employer. In accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 in respect of a competition for a post with the public service it is an offence to knowingly or recklessly make an application that is false or misleading in a material respect for the position.</p>

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations. As the Deputy will be aware there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme. Some 12,500 people benefited under the scheme in 2007 at an overall estimated cost of €74 million.

The remaining cases — 25% of the total — are received by post.  In Dublin Stamping District and Cork Stamping Office there are currently some delays in processing postal cases, particularly for the more complex documents that require to be adjudicated.  However, I am assured that the working of postal cases is continually monitored by managers and slippages are quickly identified; where backlogs arise, additional resources are specifically applied to the area concerned — including temporary redeployments of officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">I am advised that, for Stamp Duty, the monitoring by managers of the initial response to postal submissions currently involves manual counts of items of post. The current process of stamping involves title deeds being physically presented to Revenue for examination, processing and calculation of any duty payable and finally physically stamping each Deed. This is a resource-intensive process for all concerned. Revenue are progressing the development of an e-Stamping system that will, when it comes into operation in 2009, enable the majority of customers to transact their stamp duty business on ROS — the Revenue Online Service.  The legal framework for e-Stamping was provided in the Finance Act 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1451">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent change of practice announced by the Revenue Commissioners in March regarding the settlement of audits where there is a tax liability and where the taxpayer is deceased. From 18 March 2008 the imposition of penalties in tax settlements involving a deceased taxpayer under the Revenue audit programme will depend on whether or not a settlement is reached in the case prior to the death of the taxpayer. Where an agreement is reached and the penalty is unpaid at the time of death, Revenue will continue to proceed against the personal representatives of the deceased for the recovery of the penalty in the normal way. Otherwise, when no agreement is in place prior to the death of the taxpayer, Revenue will not seek to recover a penalty. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that detailed audit statistics to the level of identifying deceased taxpayers can be produced for the years from 2006 onwards only, and these are set out below.  Prior to 2006, other than fairly basic statistics, a largely manual system of audit reporting was in place. Any attempt to capture the data sought by the Deputy for the years prior to would require the manual examination of ten of thousands of audit records at a disproportionate cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">Since 2006, figures are available as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">In 2006, Revenue settled 38 cases involving deceased taxpayers collecting penalties of € 1.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">In 2007, the figures were 16 cases and just under €1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">In 2008 so far, there are just 4 cases with a total of €11,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">Revenue's audit programme is a key tools in supporting tax compliance and fairness in the tax system: 13,600 and 14,300 audits were carried out in 2006 and 2007 respectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_1461">Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) for qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course. Qualifying fees means tuition fees paid for an approved course at an approved college.  The maximum amount of qualifying fees on which tax relief is allowed is €5,000 for the academic years 2006/2007 and 2007/2008. The tax relief is confined to tuition fees only and does not extend to items such as registration fees, administration fees, accommodation, etc.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief. An approved course means either: (a) a full-time or part-time undergraduate course of study of at least 2 academic years duration at an approved college; or (b) a postgraduate course of study leading to a postgraduate award, based on a thesis or on the results of an examination or both, at an approved college of not less than one academic year, but not more than 4 academic years in duration that requires an individual, undertaking the course, to have been conferred with a degree or an equivalent qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">As regards an approved college, the school referred to in the details supplied, being a school in an EU Member State, would be an approved college for the purposes of the tax relief for tuition fees if it is a university or similar institution of higher education, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds of that Member State or is a duly accredited university or institution of higher education in the country in which it is situated.  In practice, it is a matter for the individual claiming the tax relief to obtain a letter from the relevant university or similar institute of higher education confirming that it is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds or is a duly accredited university or institution of higher education in the country in which it is situated. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that while they cannot at this point, in the absence of relevant information, comment on whether the school referred in the details supplied would be a qualifying college, they are of the view that a 14 month integrated airline transport pilot course is unlikely to be considered an undergraduate or post graduate course for the purposes of tax relief in respect of tuition fees.</p>

To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.

An individual who is not domiciled in the State but who is ordinarily resident in the State is, in general, taxable on all Irish income and on UK and foreign sourced income remitted to the State whether the individual is resident or not-resident in the State. Prior to 1 January 2008 such an individual was taxable on all UK income whether remitted or not. An individual who is not domiciled in the State and who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State is in general taxable on Irish sourced income and on foreign sourced income in respect of a trade, profession carried on in the State or employment exercised in the State. In either case, there is no statutory obligation on these individuals to return details of income or gains arising anywhere else in the world. Therefore, it is not possible to establish the amount of these income or gains, including any associated tax.</p>

Further information is of course made available to individual applicants by the receiving organisation as required.

Once the closing date for expressions of interest in the post has passed, the post due to be filled is offered by the PAS to the most senior volunteer. My understanding from the Office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the GSOC wished to review all aspects of organisational staffing both current and prospective, to cater for the long-term needs and structure of the office. In that context, following the advertisement of the post to Dublin-based staff, that office advised my Department that the filling of the post of Head of Corporate Services was postponed pending a review of the posts at senior level in the GSOC.

Differences can arise because of various retrospective adjustments and this applies particularly to 2007 where refunds to first-time buyers under the Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 necessitated retrospective adjustment to stamp duty liabilities.</p>

The measure aims to ensure that those with high incomes pay a minimum effective tax rate of approximately 20% and restricts the use of various listed tax incentives in this regard. It is currently estimated that this measure will yield approximately €70 million in a full year. As the final date for receipt of tax returns in respect of the 2007 tax year is 31 October 2008, the actual amount raised will not be known until well into 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1714">The current tax package for forestry provides that income from woodlands are exempt from income tax and corporation tax.  In addition, gains arising to individuals and certain trusts on the disposal of felled timber are not chargeable to capital gains tax.  Forestry is regarded for VAT purposes as an agricultural activity.  As regards stamp duty, there is an exemption on the value of trees where it can be certified that the land being transferred contains commercial woodlands on a substantial part of those lands. The tax treatment of forestry investment is based on the premise that such investment is long term in nature. The tax treatment of investment in and profit from forestry is derived from the unique features associated with the activity where significant levels of investment are generally required at an early stage with the returns on such investment not arising for some considerable time.  These considerations do not apply to farming income derived from woody biomass crops. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to extend the same tax treatment to such income. There is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector.  These include accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred on farm buildings, accelerated capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on certain pollution control measures, stock relief, and an exemption from income tax in respect of certain income from certain leased farmland.  In addition, certain young trained farmers can also qualify for full relief from Stamp Duty on the transfer of land.</p>

            <p eId="para_1716">The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. It is therefore not possible under EU law to apply a zero VAT rate to the supply of elephant grass rhizomes (miscanthus), seeds, bulbs, roots and similar supplies used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels. However, in Budget 2008 I took the opportunity available under the EU Directive to reduce the rate of VAT on energy crop seedstock. The VAT rate on the supply of elephant grass rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar supplies or inputs used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels was reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008. This measure was introduced to assist in the development of agricultural production of such fuels.</p>

            <p eId="para_1720">The Valuation Act 2001 maintains the long-standing position that commercial child care facilities — including all private child care facilities such as play schools, preschools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates.  However, private child care facilities which operate on a community basis in a community hall, and which are not-for-profit, are not rateable because there is not exclusive occupation of the hall.  In the circumstances, they would be part of the activities of a community hall and, therefore, exempt under Schedule 4, section 15 of the Valuation Act.  Similarly, child care facilities which operate on a non-profit basis as a charitable organisation may be deemed to be exempt depending in each instance on the terms and conditions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association. The exemption in such an instance is provided for under Schedule 4, section 16 (a) of the Act.</p>

         asked the

          the incentives from his Department and his Department’s agencies for the production of bio-fuels; if he will review these in view of the current world food crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2081">While the promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Deputy will be aware the Finance Act 2006 provided for significant tax measures to promote biofuels in Ireland.  The overall level of excise relief available for biofuels is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland's output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the coming years.  These fiscal incentives were designed to kickstart the domestic biofuels industry. Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">In addition, as a complementary measure, the Finance Act 2008 provided for the VAT rate applicable on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and similar goods used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels to be reduced from 21% to 13.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The Deputy will be aware that under proposals drafted by the European Commission, Ireland has been assigned ambitious targets for reducing emissions from sectors not covered by the Emission Trading Scheme.  In this regard, transport is one of the main areas where there will be a need to reduce emissions.  Given the lack of viable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transport fuels market, it is appropriate that there are some incentives in place in the short term that facilitate biofuels becoming more available in the market place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">I am aware of the need to strike a land use balance between energy and food crops.  Some biofuel sources are to an extent in direct competition with food production, however, I understand second generation biofuel and energy sources are less so.  The assistance we are providing is towards the production of second generation as well as first generation biofuels sources.  The European Commission has indicated its awareness of general sustainability issues in relation to biofuels and has signalled its intention to introduce incentives and support systems to avoid such issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">Specifically, it intends to encourage the development of ‘second generation' biofuels.  To this end, the Commission's renewable energy legislative proposals, contain targets for biofuels market penetration, subject to the introduction of sustainability criteria and the coming on stream of second-generation biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">The Commission also notes that European demand for biomass, especially biofuels, could contribute to improving trade relations with the European Union's trading partners, in particular developing countries, many of which have the potential to produce and export biomass and biofuels at competitive prices.  It will be important to strike a careful balance to ensure the optimum outcome in terms of reducing Green House Gas emissions in transport, providing real opportunities for local producers and developing countries, and at the same time minimising any risk in terms of food production.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">I understand the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will shortly be launching a public consultation on the proposed biofuels obligation as set out in the Programme for Government.  In that context, Ireland's biofuels obligation will take account of EU sustainability initiatives in relation to biofuels.  We should of course not forget that an increase in the prices for agricultural products also increases incomes in the agricultural industry in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2091">In responding to the Deputy's question to my predecessor Mr. Cowen, I would begin by saying that the Government recognises that improving national competitiveness is essential to facilitate a re-balancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a location for inward investment in all sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">While external factors such as the exchange rate have an impact on domestic costs, these are beyond our control.  As such, we must seek to control those costs which we can influence.  We must also take steps to improve productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">In support of these objectives, the Government is committed to maintaining a low burden of taxation on capital and labour, and has implemented a range of policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market.  We are also investing heavily in physical and human capital under the National Development Plan.  These measures will equip the Irish economy with the skills, infrastructure and operating environment needed so that we can compete effectively for projects in sectors where global demand is growing, such as business and financial services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">Of course, restoring competitiveness will also require sensible wage developments.  Therefore, it is essential that pay increases are kept at a level which does not undermine our competitive position relative to our main trading partners.  The current round of pay talks has an important role to play in this respect.</p>

As my Department completed its decentralisation to Tullamore it is not expected that there will be any further costs associated with this move.

            <p eId="para_2097">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Revenue costs incurred for decentralisation from 2004 up to end 2007 are €963,469.  The Revenue costs incurred for decentralisation during Q1 2008 are €8,648.  Both of these amounts refer to non-property decentralisation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">I am advised that to date the Valuation Office have not incurred any costs associated with their move to Youghal while the costs incurred by PAS amount to €5,306 (not including staff costs or costs associated with the CAF).</p>

            <p eId="para_2162">Of the total allocation of €833 million provided in the NDP for Decentralisation, an estimate of €60 million is provided for agencies whose costs will not be funded through the OPW vote.  The balance of €773 million represents the estimated cost of providing accommodation for the departments and agencies whose accommodation will be paid for by the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">Property solutions are being pursued in respect of some remaining locations being funded through the OPW vote and firm scale costs will emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market.  It would not be possible to give definitive costings in advance of final agreement on specific proposals.  It is expected however that overall costs will remain within the published estimate figures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2189">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2005. RACs and PRSAs are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">The information is set out in tables following this reply which provide the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs for the various contribution ranges.  The information is based on income returns contained in Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 98.5 % of all returns expected.  A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">It is not possible to provide corresponding figures in regard to the take-up of the tax relief for pension contributions by employers and employees to occupational pension schemes as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers or employers.  The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers from 2006 on.  These changes have yielded additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but as the returns are aggregated at employer level they cannot provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for changes at individual level or enable a distribution of pension tax relief across the different income cohorts to be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_2506">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent.  I should mention that this is just one of a number of initiatives in the Programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">When considering a change in the VAT treatment of a good or service, it is important to bear in mind that the scope for such change is derived from EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the environmental impact of the good or service.  There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of a reduced VAT rate on supplies of goods or services based on their environmental impact per se.  However, at Community level, we support calls for the Commission to examine the potential use of reduced VAT rates in promoting environmentally friendly goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">I would of course draw to the Deputy's attention that in the 2008 Finance Act the VAT rate on the supply of miscanthus rhizomes, seeds bulbs and similar inputs used for the agricultural production of biofuels was reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008.  This measure will assist in the development of agricultural production of such fuels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2516">The National Economic and Social Forum's report on Mental Health and Social Inclusion is consistent with ‘A Vision for Change' which was launched in January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">A key recommendation of the NESF report is the establishment of cross-departmental structures to address mental health and social inclusion.  In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health.  The Office is a cross-departmental Government office with functions in four Departments: Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Director of the Office is a member of the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">The Office's functions include driving the recommendations of ‘A Vision for Change', bringing a new impetus to the implementation of the Report through working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  The recommendations of the NESF report will inform the work of the Office in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2601">I am aware of the results of the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) Manpower Survey 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">The number of General Practitioners who are in active practice is about 2,500.  This equates to approximately 0.5 GPs per 1000 of the population, a ratio that is low by comparison with other EU and OECD countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">I recognise there is a need to increase the number of GPs to take account of the projected growth in population, the ageing of the population and the ageing of the GP workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">The Government has taken a number of initiatives to address this.  In February, 2006 we announced that the number of medical school places for EU students would be more than doubled by 305 to 725.  The number of 305 places had been in place since 1978 through successive governments.  Now there will be a new graduate entry stream providing an additional 240 places and increasing the number of EU undergraduate places by 180.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">A total of 170 extra medical school places have been provided between 2006 and 2007 for Irish/EU students in the existing undergraduate courses and in the new graduate entry programme.  A further 95 places will be made available in 2008 with the remaining 155 places coming on stream over the next 2 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2606">In 2004, it was  agreed with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) that the number of GP vocational training places should be increased from 84 to 150 on a phased basis over three years.  I am informed by the HSE that to date, 36 of the additional 66 places have been provided, bringing the total number of training places annually to 120.  The further increase to 150 places is being kept under review by the HSE in the light of the current budgetary situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2607">There are currently 12 GP vocational training programmes in the State and these programmes are accredited by the ICGP.  376 trainees are currently participating in these programmes and the HSE has advised that this number will increase to 449 in July 2008.  The HSE has indicated that there have been capacity issues within these training programmes and that this is the principal reason that it has not been possible to increase the number of training places as quickly as had been hoped.  The HSE continues to work with the ICGP with a view to addressing these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2608">A joint Department of Health and Children / HSE  working group on workforce planning  was established in June 2006.  It also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance and Education and Science, and the Higher Education Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2609">Research is currently being undertaken by FÁS on behalf of the joint working group.  This research will analyse the labour market for 11 healthcare grades and professions, including GPs, and will help determine future GP training needs.  FÁS is expected to complete its work by the end of 2008 when it will report its findings to the joint working group.</p>

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2622">As the Deputy may be aware, requests for assessment for intercountry adoption are continuously increasing.  The recent study on intercountry adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for foreign adoption in Europe.  In addition, as a result of the increased number of children coming from abroad, a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports from sending countries has been created.  Both assessments and post-placement reports are being undertaken by HSE social work staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2623">The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive.  It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.  In a number of areas, the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2624">The HSE has undertaken a review of the intercountry adoption service.  This review examined staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service.  The HSE has indicated that it will contact the Department shortly with a proposed strategy on the management of the service into the future based on this work and parallel discussions with professionals within the service.  I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system.</p>

As the meetings can be quite frequent and informal minutes are not kept in the ordinary course of events, but the meetings inform part of what is an ongoing dialogue in advance of final discussions on the Estimates.

The HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2730">This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of Circular 01/2008.  This circular sets out the HSE Employment Control Framework for 2008 and is aimed at ensuring that health services are delivered in accordance with the provisions of the 2008 National Service Plan and within the funding provided by Government.  The Employment Control Framework provides for the filling of vacancies arising in 2008, the filling of approved and funded service development posts not filled at the end of 2007 and new service developments in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">An overall employment ceiling of 112,560 whole time equivalents has been set for the public health services for 2008 (111,650 adjusted for student nurses).  This level of employment provides for 1,050 additional new posts arising from development funding provided by the Government in the Budget Day package for 2008.  Following consideration of the requirements to deliver the priorities identified by Government in the Budget package, 1050 posts have been approved for 2008.  A breakdown of these development posts is provided below.</p>

            <p eId="para_2759">The roll out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis and is in the final stages of preparations.  The service will be available free of charge to all eligible women in Ireland aged 25-60.  A national programme will provide screening in a primary care setting every three years for women aged 25-44 years and screening every five years for women aged 45-60 years.  The priority is to establish a national quality assured, organised cervical screening programme and it will be implemented in line with best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">All elements of the programme will be quality assured — call and recall, laboratory testing, colposcopy and will be managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  A cytology procurement process is underway.  This process commenced in December 2007 and the outcome of this will be announced shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">The vital emphasis of the procurement process has been and will be on quality of the national programme.  The necessary entry criteria in choosing a cytology partner included accreditation status and that the laboratory dealt with a minimum of 25,000 smears per annum.  These criteria were chosen in line with international acceptable criteria for cervical screening programmes.  The NCSS will ensure that the laboratory elements will be delivered in an efficient and cost effective manner and with high quality and acceptable turn-around time for results and so avoid unacceptably long delays for routine cervical smear test results as a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">The specific question raised by the Deputy in relation to standards, capacity and capability of cytology laboratories relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2767">I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health to support the Minister for Disability &amp; Mental Health in exercising their responsibilities across four Government Departments: Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">The new Office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues.  The Office will aim to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues, by working to develop person-centred services, focussing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">Very substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health, but much remains to be done.  In particular, there is a need to improve co-ordination and communication across different Government Departments and agencies in their delivery of services to this client group.  This will be the main focus for the new Office in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">The key priorities for the Office for Disability and Mental Health are:</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">supporting the implementation of the Health Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005.  The Office will focus in particular on facilitating the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with special needs, by further developing existing mechanisms for co-operation and co-ordination between the health and education sectors, both at national and local level;</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">developing an appropriate continuum of training and employment support services for people with a disability by working together with the Dept. of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FAS and the HSE;</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">bringing a new impetus to the implementation of A Vision for Change, working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">Achieving greater cooperation between the health and justice sectors on matters relating to people with mental illness who come before the Courts, who are in the prison system or in the Central Mental Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">The Director of the Office for Disability and Mental Health is Bairbre Nic Aongusa, formerly Deputy Director of the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC).  During her time in the OMC, Ms Nic Aongusa engaged extensively in the type of cross-agency and cross-Departmental work that is now required to achieve real progress in disability and mental health.  She brings that experience and expertise with her to the new Office, in addition to her experience as a senior manager in the Department of Health &amp; Children over several years.  The Director of the Office is a member of the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, which monitors progress on the Government's commitments in relation to social policy.  The Government has also agreed that meetings will be held on a quarterly basis between the Minister for Disability and Mental Health, the four Secretary Generals of the relevant Departments and the Director of the new Office, to review progress in the priority areas.  The staff of the Office were drawn from within existing resources as per Government policy on public service numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">In conclusion, the Government's decision to establish the Office for Disability and Mental Health reflects its commitment to developing a more coherent and integrated response to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues.  It recognises that clients and service users need to be at the centre of service delivery and that we may need to examine the way in which services are currently delivered to ensure that is the case.  To effectively achieve this requires a cross-Departmental, cross-agency response.  The designation of a Minister of State with responsibility for Disabilities and Mental Health and the establishment of an Office for Disability and Mental Health will facilitate cross-agency and cross-departmental working and enable us to deliver real benefits to clients and service users into the future.</p>

There has been no decline in acute beds.  Since the establishment of the Health Service Executive in 2004 and the splitting of some catchment areas it is not possible to compare data between the former health board areas and the HSE areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, ‘A Vision for Change', which was launched in January 2006 and represents Government policy, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health services for a seven to ten year period.  The Report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and the reinvestment of the resources released by these closures in mental health service.  It emphasises that this process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially and that hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres.  Currently, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country providing over 3,000 places.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2811">The OECD review of the Irish Public Service report entitled Ireland Towards an Integrated Public Service, was launched by the Taoiseach on Monday 28 April and includes a Case Study on the reconfiguration of the Hospital Services in the North East.  I think it is important to note that the OECD state that the health sector Case Study does not purport to be a full analysis or review of wider issues relating to health care in Ireland or a commentary on health service provision generally in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">The OECD note that the health of the Irish is good and improving at an exceptionally rapid pace.  Ireland is the European country which had the most spectacular increase in its life expectancy at birth since 1990: almost five years in 15 years, an average of four months a year.  The OECD recommend that there should be a focus on longer-term outcomes such as life expectancy to measure the performance of the health system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">The Report emphasises the need to deal with the reforms of primary and community care in tandem with the reconfiguration of hospitals if the overall vision is to be realised.  In order to ensure the model is the optimum given the specific characteristics of the region, it suggests taking a broader look at international systems, including systems that are similar in terms of their needs, in order to examine different patterns of hospital requirements in the North East.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">The OECD took the view that this may include the possibility of having two hospitals, one regional, and one general.  It may equally be that the outcome of such an examination would be a reaffirmation of the plan for one acute hospital for the region.  At this point no decisions have been made by the Government or by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the future location of the new hospital.  The immediate task for the HSE is to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.  The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to improve services by further merger of their acute care specialties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2815">Finally, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the OECD confirm that policy objectives of the proposal to reconfigure hospital services in the North East are based on sound principles: "Clinically, the reform programme makes sense and will lead to safer, better quality treatment options for citizens".  There is also an acceptance that there is a clear vision within the HSE regarding how health care services in the North East will be delivered following final implementation of all reforms.</p>

            <p eId="para_2822">The charges are implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005.  These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person.  The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship".  Under Section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person's overall financial situation in view of the person's reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.  It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</p>

Since 2003 the census has been carried out quarterly at the end of March, June, September and December each year.  The data referred to in the question are unavailable as yet, however, the latest census data from the end of March are set out in the following table (source: Health Service Personnel Census):</p>

            <p eId="para_2991">Earlier this year the Health Service Executive obtained provisional alcohol consumption data from the Revenue Commissioners which indicated an increase of 2.7% in per capita alcohol consumption for 2007 compared to 2006.  The 2006 Census population figure was used in this calculation.  The Central Statistics Office recently released its population estimate for 2007 which showed an increase on 2006.  Based on this estimate, the per capita alcohol consumption rate seems to have increased by 0.21% in 2007 over 2006.  This figure remains provisional pending final alcohol consumption data from the Revenue Commissioners later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2992">I remain concerned that the per capita alcohol consumption rate in Ireland is well above the EU average.  Reducing our consumption levels is key to tackling alcohol related harm in Ireland.  The Government will continue to identify, promote and support measures to achieve this aim.</p>

            <p eId="para_2998">Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia in Ireland.  It is characterised by progressive, and almost always, irreversible decline in mental functioning.  The condition has no single cause and, as yet, no single cure. It has a life changing physical, emotional and mental impact on the affected person and their primary carer and family.  It is largely, but not exclusively, a condition of older age.  While dementia is not solely related to age, it does affect 5% of people over 65 years with the figure rising to 20% over 80 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2999">The case for any new screening programme would have to be carefully assessed against international criteria for the application of such programmes. These would include, for example, the ability to reliably predict the disease earlier than would present normally. The question of intervening earlier to change the course of the disease would also have to be determined, prior to the introduction of any effective programme. My Department is obviously familiar with the various and complex evolving issues associated with bringing about improvements in the detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  In this context, my Department will keep the issue of an effective screening programme in this regard under close review. It is important that information, care and support are made available as early as possible and this is what services try to achieve.</p>

            <p eId="para_3023">Separated children seeking asylum going missing from care is not a phenomenon unique to Ireland.  Evidence from other countries indicates this is a substantial problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_3024">Most of the unaccompanied minors in Ireland are placed in the care of the Health Service Executive under the Child Care Act, 1991.  My Department has asked the HSE to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and welfare of these young people.  The HSE has assured my Department that all possible steps are taken to protect these children within the resources available.  The 2001 "Policy on Absence without Leave" is being followed in respect of these children. Each child who goes missing is reported, (on an agreed template with photograph and physical description), to the following: Local Garda Station; Garda National Immigration Bureau; Child Care Manager (for circulation throughout the country); Supt. Community Welfare Officer, Asylum Seekers Unit (for flagging on the National Social Welfare record system); Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (for circulation to other relevant asylum process agencies); and Local services notified.</p>
            <p eId="para_3025">New national protocols regarding missing children are currently being drafted and will be finalised shortly.  The HSE are in consultation with the Garda Missing Persons Bureau on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3026">The HSE are devising a National Policy, including an operational policy, for separated children.  This is being finalised and it is understood to include the principle that all children in the care of the HSE should receive the same standard of care whether they be separated children seeking asylum or indigenous children in care.  The policy will also reflect the principle of good practice that younger children under 12 should be placed in foster care with older less vulnerable young people placed in residential care as appropriate. The implementation of such a policy through the enhanced level of care should have a significant impact on the numbers of such young people going missing from the care of the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_3069">While the airport authority does not have direct responsibility for promoting investment in the Cork region, one of the policy objectives in separating out Cork airport is to enable an independent airport, operating to a commercial mandate, to assist in the economic and tourist based development of its catchment area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3081">The IAA carries out rigorous surveillance and enforcement in the conduct of its safety oversight functions. Furthermore the standards applied and the quality of the surveillance is subject to standardisation inspection by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on behalf of the EU Commission.  The IAA is subject to several of these inspections per annum on a repetitive basis.  These standardisation inspections are detailed and rigorous and provide independent assurance of the standards applied by the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">My responsibility in relation to the safety functions of the Authority arises under Section 32 of the 1993 Act, which requires me periodically, to commission an examination of the performance by the company of its functions insofar as they relate to the application and enforcement of technical and safety standards in relation to aircraft and air navigation. The most recent examination took place in 2004 and concluded that there is a general, positive and proactive attitude and competence vis-à-vis safety and the maintenance of a high safety level.  I intend to commission a further independent audit of the company's performance this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3112">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dail question Nos 70, 59 and 19 of today's date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3113">At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the programmes and projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for implementation in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 within an overall capital provision of €34 billion.  That objective has not changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3114">The prioritization of those programmes and projects was influenced by relevant Government policies such as the National Spatial Strategy and by a number of relevant studies such as the National Road Needs Study, the Strategic Rail Review, the DTO Strategy document "A Platform for Change" the Cork Area Strategic Study and proposals submitted by the principal implementing agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3115">The significant progress made on Transport 21 in its first two years is continuing.  A number of projects have been completed and many more are either under construction or well advanced in planning.  For example most national road projects are now being completed ahead of schedule and within budget and it is expected that the five major inter-urban routes will be completed by the end of 2010.  New rolling stock and improved services are being introduced across the intercity rail network and the capacity of trams on the Tallaght Luas line has been increased by 40%.  In addition, construction is underway on the Luas extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands and on the Midleton, Western Rail Corridor and Kildare Route rail projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">The Government has committed to the overall funding for Transport 21 over its ten-year life to 2015.  The Exchequer element of the funding is provided through the normal annual budget and estimates process.  For the first three years of Transport 21, the capital funding provided has been fully in line with the originally agreed profile of expenditure.  The Government has repeatedly indicated that the National Development Plan, of which Transport 21 is a fundamental part, is its top priority and that, even in difficult economic circumstances, it will seek to continue to provide the funding necessary to develop its capital programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3130">The sustained high levels of capital investment in the railway network since 1997 — totalling over €2 billion in the period 1997-2007, has facilitated a substantial expansion in services across InterCity and Commuter railway services.  Capacity, for example, on the Kildare and Maynooth lines has increased by 125% and 250% respectively since 2000.  The introduction of new rolling stock on the Cork-Dublin line has enabled the introduction of an hourly service each way.  These service improvements along with others across the network are reflected in the growth in passenger numbers which Iarnród Éireann has achieved of 33% in the last 3 years alone.  The deployment of the 183 new InterCity railcars throughout 2008 and into 2009, and the completion of the Kildare line upgrade project, the Cork-Midleton line and the Western Rail Corridor will all facilitate a further substantial increase in InterCity and Commuter services.  In the short to medium term, the completion of the City Centre Re-signalling and the Inter-connector/Electrification projects in the Dublin area will transform commuter services in the Dublin area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3150">I am fully conscious of the enormous contribution that missionaries and volunteer development workers have made to Irish development work.  This is reflected in the significant level of Irish Aid funding to civil society organisations and the large increases in funding to the Irish Missionary Resource Service (IMRS).  This year, Irish Aid will provide funding of €20m in support of IMRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">Responsibility for pension protection rests with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  However, the protection of the interests of missionaries and overseas development workers is a matter of real concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">The issue of pension provision for overseas development workers and missionaries is a particularly complex one.  The position of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is that any proposal to pay the State Pension (Non-Contributory) to missionaries who are Irish citizens living outside the State would set an unacceptable precedent and would break EU pension regulations.  As far as Irish Aid's own funds are concerned, our position is that a pension provision, in any form, for retired missionaries living overseas could not be considered as overseas development assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">Nevertheless, my Department continues to be in contact on a regular basis with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and Comhlámh, the organisation which acts on behalf of returned development workers, regarding the issue of pension provision.

            <p eId="para_3177">Relations between Turkey and Armenia are complicated by a number of outstanding issues.  The major dispute between the two countries centres on the different interpretations of events during the First World War which resulted in the tragic deaths of very large numbers of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.  The Turkish Government has proposed the establishment of a commission, composed of eminent academics, to investigate and determine the facts of this tragic episode in their shared history.  While it has not been possible to move forward on the basis of this proposal, we would encourage both sides to explore ways to make progress on this most sensitive issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_3178">More generally, there have been recent reports of initial, tentative steps by both the Turkish and Armenian authorities aimed at improving bilateral relations. I note in particular that, when President Sargsyan of Armenia took office last month, he promised to improve bilateral ties with Turkey and also that Turkish President Abdullah Gul was among those who congratulated him on his election. I would encourage both sides to try to build on these first steps, and to work to develop the goodwill required to enable them to address their broader differences.</p>

            <p eId="para_3191">UN agencies and other development agencies have identified deteriorating security and internal displacement as two of the chief operational challenges they face in addressing the humanitarian situation in Chad in 2008.  We are very aware of the situation and my colleague, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern TD, visited Chad in November of last year, to see the situation on the ground in advance of the arrival of the contingent of Irish peacekeepers.  He met with Government Ministers, but also with the humanitarian agencies and a number of refugees.</p>
            <p eId="para_3192">There are more than 252,000 Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad, 12,000 of who have crossed from Darfur since early February.  Additionally there are about 180,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs).  There are also approximately 57,000 refugees who have fled conflict in the Central African Republic.  It is estimated that there are about 50,000 refugees from Chad currently displaced across the border in Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3193">The transport of relief supplies to eastern Chad is a major and complex logistical challenge.  Most supplies must pass through Cameroon or Libya and this involves an overland journey of up to 1,800 kilometres, through difficult terrain.</p>
            <p eId="para_3194">The World Food Programme (WFP) and other relief-providers active in food aid and food security in eastern Chad are aware of the seasonal factors involved in maintaining this pipeline and have planned accordingly.  However, the sheer difficulty involved in this provision means it is likely that not all plans will be realised, and some contingency measures may be necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3195">Ireland's support to humanitarian endeavour in Chad has increased significantly.  Since 2007 Ireland has provided over €11 million in assistance.  The partner organisations delivering this assistance on the ground have included the WFP, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and Concern and MSF. Funding also included a contribution of €2 million to the Humanitarian Air Service, which provides transport to remote regions.  We continue to monitor the situation on the ground and will respond appropriately.</p>

            <p eId="para_3208">During the visit of the former Taoiseach to Washington, my predecessor, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D., participated in his meetings with President Bush, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Edward Kennedy. On 1 May, Minister Ahern had a further series of meetings with key Congressional and Administration figures to press the case for finding a solution for our undocumented. Among those he met were: Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Chair of the House Sub-Committee on Immigration; Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Congressman Jim Walsh and Ms Paula Dobriansky, Under-Secretary of State and Special Envoy to Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3209">My predecessor also had a constructive and forward looking meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, with both sides determined to continue to work closely together on this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative options.</p>
            <p eId="para_3211">However, achieving progress on immigration reform at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. The political reality in the United States is that immigration has become a divisive political issue. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 12 million undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_3212">Despite these considerable political challenges, the Government will continue to press for change. We will work closely with our friends in Congress, with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, and with the many organisations who have worked hard on behalf of the undocumented in the Irish community, with a view to trying to find a way forward which would remedy the very difficult situation in which our undocumented find themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_3228">The global spread of our Diaspora is very considerable. For a small nation, it is practically unparalleled. Our largest emigrant communities have consistently lived in Britain and the United States, Irish citizens have also been an influential presence in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Southern Africa for very many decades. While the precise number of Irish citizens resident around the world is not known, the enormous contribution they have made to their host countries and to Ireland is well documented.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">In 2002, the Report of the Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants, which is considered the most authoritative research yet conducted on the extent of our Diaspora, stated that there were approximately three million Irish citizens living abroad, over 1.2 million of whom were born in the island of Ireland. There are several impediments to providing a more precise figure than this. For example, Irish citizens are not required to register with any official Government body when leaving the State, or when resident abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">Some countries, including the United States, include questions regarding ancestry in their census forms, and so offer a broad estimate of the total number of people of Irish heritage residing there. Being of Irish heritage, however, does not necessarily entitle one to Irish citizenship. Estimates of Irish ancestry in census returns are, therefore, of very limited assistance in estimating the precise number of resident Irish citizens abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">As regards information to be gleaned from passports, a snap-shot of those issued in 2007 shows that, out of some 600,000, 80,000 were issued by our Embassies and Consulates. Our Embassy in London was the highest issuing office at almost 43,000, with our offices in North America accounting for almost 16,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">Finally, the prevalence of unreported citizenship by descent is another complicating factor when it comes to estimating the number of Irish citizens overseas. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004, a person born outside of Ireland is automatically an Irish citizen by descent, if one of his/her parents was an Irish citizen and born in Ireland. Many citizens by descent, however, do not "activate" dual citizenship by, for example, acquiring an Irish passport.</p>

            <p eId="para_3234">Ireland's diplomatic network consists of 75 resident Missions abroad, in addition to offices in Armagh and Belfast. These Missions also have over 80 additional accreditations to other countries and organisations. There are also 21 Honorary Consuls General and 67 Honorary Consuls who provide assistance to Irish citizens in 59 countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3235">Ambassadorial appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Government. There is no specific grade attached to the post of Ambassador. The majority of Ireland's Heads of Mission, a term which covers Ambassadors, Permanent Representatives and Consuls General, are civil servants serving in the grade of Assistant Secretary. There is also a significant number of Heads of Mission who are in the grades of either Counsellor/Principal Officer or First Secretary/Assistant Principal Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3236">I have set out in the table below the locations and accreditations, both primary and secondary, of all Irish Ambassadors, Permanent Representatives and other Heads of Mission serving abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_3359">My Department works closely with Irish sporting organisations to ensure that our citizens attending major sporting events abroad receive a first class consular service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">In accordance with normal practice, I intend to have additional resources allocated to our Embassy in Sofia, which is accredited to Georgia, and to our Embassy in Budapest, which is accredited to Montenegro, to ensure that the best possible service is provided to Irish soccer supporters attending the matches in Georgia and Montenegro on 6th and 10th September respectively. In this regard, temporary consular offices will be opened in both locations for the period of the games.</p>
            <p eId="para_3361">The Embassies are in ongoing contact with the relevant authorities in the countries concerned and will be organising pre-match planning visits to Tbilisi and Podgorica in June. The Department's Consular Division is, as always, liaising with the Football Association of Ireland to ensure that it is fully briefed on our arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3362">In addition to arrangements on the ground, our Embassies and the Consular Section are jointly working on a comprehensive travel advisory note for Irish supporters travelling to the matches. This will be available in due course on the Department's website, www.dfa.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_3364">The Government consistently raises in its contacts with the British Government ongoing issues which are the legacy of the Troubles.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">These issues are currently being considered by the Independent Consultative Group on the Past, which was established in June 2007, under the chairmanship of Archbishop Robin Eames and Denis Bradley. The Government welcomed the establishment of the Consultative Group and has remained in close contact with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3366">Among the important topics on which the Consultative Group is deliberating is how best to meet the demand for truth, justice and apology for the many terrible deeds which occurred during the Troubles. As they move to develop their proposals the Consultative Group has met with many stakeholders across the spectrum of those affected, including in this jurisdiction: I understand that the group referred to in the question has met with the Consultative Group on the Past on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3367">My Department was represented at an event in Dublin on 30 April hosted by the group referred to in the question.

            <p eId="para_3369">I am aware of this correspondence and share the concerns of the group regarding the situation facing the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">The Government has consistently and actively promoted efforts to find a lasting, peaceful and just settlement to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. We have been to the fore in arguing directly with the parties, in cooperation with our EU partners, and at the United Nations, that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is through a negotiated two-State solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3371">The Government strongly supports the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to reach a final status agreement by the end of 2008. However, as my predecessor has stated in this House and elsewhere, we are increasingly concerned that events on the ground will undermine the prospects for political progress. We are particularly concerned about the appalling situation in Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_3372">The immediate priority must be to end all violence in and from the Occupied Territories, including all rocket attacks by Palestinian groups and all military operations by the Israeli Army in the Occupied Territories. The EU strongly supports the continuing efforts, being led by Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, which could form the basis for a broader agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The Government has called consistently for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, for the urgent re-opening of the crossing points for people and for goods, for the lifting of restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank, and for an immediate and genuine freeze on all settlement construction. At the European Council in Brussels in March, the EU reiterated that settlement building anywhere in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law, prejudges the outcome of final status negotiations and threatens the viability of an agreed two-State solution. At its meeting in London last Friday, the Quartet emphasised the importance of visible progress on the ground to build confidence and create an atmosphere supportive of negotiations. The Quartet called for an end to all violence and called on Israel to freeze all settlement activity including natural growth, and to dismantle outposts erected since March 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3373">The Government monitors the human rights situation in the Occupied Territories constantly through our Embassy in Tel Aviv, our Representative Office in Ramallah, and in close consultation with a wide range of Palestinian and Israeli NGOs and civil society groups. We also cooperate closely in this regard with our partners in the EU and regularly raise our concerns directly with the Israeli authorities. These concerns are also raised directly under the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The next meeting of the EU — Israel Association Council will take place on 16 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_3374">The Government does not believe that suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement would serve the interests of any of the parties. We are also firmly opposed to any proposals for cultural, academic or other boycotts against Israel. Our priority is to encourage all efforts to restore momentum to the peace process through meaningful negotiations for the establishment of a Palestinian State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3375">Ireland's assistance to the Palestinians has risen by some 70% over the past two years, to €7.5 million in 2007. At the International Donors' Conference for the Palestinian State in Paris in December 2007, Ireland pledged €40 million for Palestinian recovery, reconstruction and development, in the context of political agreement. We will continue to respond to the needs of the Palestinian people, and to work for a peaceful and just settlement of the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. This will remain a major priority of the Government's foreign policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3377">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 108 posts or approximately 87% of the 124 posts being decentralised. The new permanent offices for Irish Aid in Limerick are expected to be completed in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3378">The property related costs associated with the decentralisation programme are a charge on the Office of Public Works. The following table sets out the non-property costs incurred by this Department during the period 2004-2008. The increase experienced in 2007 relates to the costs associated with the establishment of interim offices in Limerick in May of that year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3421">The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) contains a financial instrument, the SME Guarantee Facility that aims to improve the financial environment for SMEs by facilitating their access to debt and equity finance. The European Commission published a Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union on 26 September 2007 addressed to financial intermediaries for SMEs, such as banks and institutions operating guarantee schemes, outlining information on the financial instrument. The SME Guarantee Facility is operated by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the European Commission.  Financial intermediaries are free to make contact directly with the EIF concerning participation in the facility and I am aware that some have done so in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_3422">My Department has informed the Irish Bankers' Federation of the proposal, the operation and the scope of the arrangement.  My Department has made itself available to any bank interested in pursuing the possibility of securing funding under the SME Guarantee, with a view to their being put in contact with relevant officials in the European Investment Fund (EIF) and/or the European Commission, for further advice and assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3423">Proposals from financial intermediaries will be examined by the EIF on a continuous basis, within the constraints of the available Community budget allocations. Irish financial intermediaries will, therefore, continue to have an opportunity to participate in the Facility.  My Department will continue to encourage participation and will remain available to financial intermediaries wishing to access the Facility.  Participation in the Facility is a commercial decision for any financial intermediary concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_3430">As the Deputy knows, enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement (REA) may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement the Court may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.  These safeguards are in place to ensure the satisfactory implementation of Registered Employment Agreement wages and conditions of employment and to ensure that non–compliant employers are discovered and do not benefit in any way from their avoidance of their obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2001 offer protection to employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for employees who have been found to have been unfairly dismissed.  The Acts do not normally apply to a person who has been in the continuous service of the employer for less than one year.  However, if the unfair dismissal results from trade union activity, then the requirement of one year's service does not apply.  A complainant may refer a case regarding unfair dismissal to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_3435">Irish employment law applies to all workers including agency workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3436">Accordingly, I understand that agency workers who enter into or work under a contract of employment can, under the terms of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, qualify for minimum notice in respect of termination of employment. Its application will depend on individual circumstances. Given the changing nature of employment structures and relationships in which, for example, the term "agency worker" could cover a range of situations in practice it is difficult to be precise and each case depends on its own facts. Workers posted to Ireland from abroad — including agency workers — do, of course, have the benefit of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts by virtue of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time work) Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3437">I am not aware of any problems arising in this area, generally. However, if the Deputy has any specific cases that he would like to bring to my attention, I would be happy to have them considered.</p>

         when she expects the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to be fully implemented; when the ban on traders charging extra to customers based on their method of payment will be implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3439">Sections 48 and 49 are the relevant sections of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 which seek to restrict the manner in which traders impose additional charges on consumers solely by reason of the method of payment chosen by the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3440">The Deputy will be aware that on the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 in May last year, sections 48 and 49 were not commenced.  A public consultation was conducted on these provisions and, in the course of that consultation, my Department received almost 50 submissions on the impact of sections 48 and 49.  The submissions gave rise to a number of complex matters which required legal advice, particularly regarding the compatibility of sections 48 and 49 with provisions of EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3441">These responses raised a number of specific issues upon which the Department sought the advice of the Attorney General.  These issues related to the compatibility of sections 48 and 49 with EU law, specifically with the EU directive on unfair commercial practices and the EU payment services directive.  The Attorney General's advice is that sections 48 and 49 are not compatible with the maximum harmonisation nature of the unfair commercial practices directive in that the sections seek to legislate within the field of consumer protection approximated by the directive.  He argues that by going beyond what is permitted by the directive, the sections are not compatible with the maximum harmonisation nature of the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3442">As the Attorney General has advised that sections 48 and 49 are not compatible with EU law, it has been decided not to commence these provisions.  I am, however, committed to the importance of consumers being made aware of the fact that a trader imposes an additional charge based on the method of payment before transacting with that trader. My Department is currently examining the possibility of making regulations under the Consumer Protection Act obliging traders who impose payment method charges to include information on those charges in any advertisements for their goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">In the course of the public consultation process, retailers in opposing the introduction of section 48, maintained that they were merely passing on to the cardholder the cost imposed on the retailer by the card companies for facilitating card transactions.  The Deputy may be aware of the recent decision of the competition directorate of the EU banning Mastercard from requiring retailers to pay its multilateral interchange fee for facilitating Mastercard transactions.  It is understood that the competition directorate has recently commenced similar proceedings against the other major payment card scheme Visa.  In that context, the advice of the Competition Authority as to the implications of this decision and its effects in Ireland, particularly in terms of the likely impact on the costs to retailers of accepting payment by particular payment methods, has been sought.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3446">I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 279 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department has had no application for a rebate in respect of any sum paid to employees by way of statutory redundancy from the construction company in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">The purpose of the Redundancy Payments Scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2007, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy. Compensation is based on the workers' length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of €600.00 per week. Broadly speaking, a redundancy situation obtains where a job ceases to exist, the employment is terminated by the employer and the employee is not replaced. Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer. On payment of statutory redundancy to an employee, an employer is entitled to apply for a rebate of 60% of the total cost from the Social Insurance Fund. There are no conditions attached to the end-use of any monies rebated to the Employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">However, it is the policy of the Government to pay a rebate only where the strict criteria stipulating genuine grounds for redundancy are met under Section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, as amended by Section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971 and Section 5 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 2003, and Section 4 of the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3450">If the employees involved believe that they have been unfairly dismissed they may present a claim of unfair dismissal to either a Rights Commissioner or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts apply with certain exceptions, to employees over age 16 with at least 12 months' continuous service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3451">Checking of P35s is a matter in the first instance for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and I would not be aware of checks made in any particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3452">An Employment Agreement on wages and conditions of employment in the Construction Industry has been registered with the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_3453">The effect of this registration is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.  Section 10 of this REA sets out requirements for the engagement of sub-contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3454">The provisions of the Construction Industry's REA on wages and conditions of employment are enforced by the Labour Inspectors of the National Employment Rights Authority. Labour Inspectors are empowered to seek compliance with the terms specified in the agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">The enforcement of the provisions of the Registered Employment Agreement may also be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand that the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency (CIMA), which was established by the Construction Industry Federation and ICTU monitors compliance with the REA in this respect, with a view to ensuring that employers register their employees in the pension scheme and pay the weekly pension contributions on employees' behalf.  Enforcement of the provisions of this Registered Employment Agreement may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3481">It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the minimum hours that are required to be worked in order to be eligible for certain FÁS employment programmes for people with disabilities.  In this regard the significant employment support schemes provided by FÁS for people with disabilities are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3482">The Wage Subsidy Scheme is available to all employers (except public service employers and/or any employers or schemes where wages are funded by FÁS) in the State who provide a minimum of 21 hours of employment per week to disabled workers.  The objective of the scheme is to increase the number of people with disabilities in employment, as far as practicable, and to provide a level playing field for them in seeking out, or remaining in employment. The scheme provides payment of a wage subsidy to the employer to compensate for the reduced productivity of the disabled worker.  The wage subsidies are designed to provide an incentive to employers to look more closely at the potential of people with disabilities to meet their labour force requirements.  Disabled workers may work up to 39 hours per week in agreement with their employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3483">The Supported Employment programme is a labour market initiative providing supports to help people with disabilities access the open labour market.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations on behalf of FÁS who employ job coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of job coach support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">It is expected that participants on Supported Employment, upon commencement of employment, will enter a progression for a working time strategy leading to work in excess of 18 hours per week.  Exceptions may be made in cases where it is believed that the jobseeker requires further support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">The Community Employment Programme provides eligible unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons, including people with disabilities, with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis. CE has three categories of participant, each with its own set of qualifying conditions, namely:</p>
            <p eId="para_3486">1. Part-time Integration option</p>
            <p eId="para_3487">2. Part-time job option</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">3. Rate for the job option</p>
            <p eId="para_3489">Community sponsors must provide 39 hours per fortnight on the Part-time Integration Option and the Part-time Job Option, and between 24 and 39 hours per fortnight for participants on the Rate for Job Option.</p>
            <p eId="para_3490">The eligibility criteria for all FÁS employment programmes, including those for people with disabilities, are implemented by FÁS in accordance with my Department's policy goals that are aimed at enhancing the employment prospects of people with disabilities.  These employment programmes are reviewed at appropriate intervals with a view to increasing programme efficiency and effectiveness where possible.  In this regard reviews of both the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme are nearing completion and are expected to be concluded very shortly. Copies of these reviews will be made available to relevant interest groups in due course.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3492">Unemployment has increased by 15,200 in the three-year period since 2004 and must be seen in the context of the substantial increase in employment by 242,500 in the same period.  The number of people currently in employment is 2,138,900.    It is generally accepted that the strong rate of growth experienced over the past few years could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.  Employment is forecast to grow by over 1% (24,000) in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3493">Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, published and collated by the CSO, rather than the Live Register which is not designed to measure unemployment.  The Live Register includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  However, while the Live Register increased in the first three months of the year, data for April reflects a decrease of 2,349.</p>
            <p eId="para_3494">The actual rise in unemployment over the coming months will be determined by a number of factors including a possible decrease in participation and the response of migrants to the slowdown.  In regard to the latter the ESRI expects inward migration to fall from 70,000 in 2007 to 20,000 in 2008.  The trend in PPS numbers issued to persons from the EU12 continues to reflect a decline in the numbers entering the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3495">The most recent FÁS/ESRI Employment and Vacancies Survey for March 2008 shows that the percentage of firms reporting vacancies across all sectors is 10%, indicating that there are still employment opportunities available.</p>

            <p eId="para_3498">The Minister for Finance normally holds a formal bilateral meeting with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment each year as part of the Estimates process, to discuss the Department's requirements for the year ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_3499">As my Department's records relating to the Estimates process for the period 2000 to 2004 are stored off-site, it has not been possible, in the time available to my officials, to identify the dates of bilateral meetings, if any, held between 2000 and 2004.  However, the dates of the meetings held in the last three years were: 16 November 2005, 28 September 2006 and 24 October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3500">There were no separate pre-Budget bilateral meetings with the Taoiseach in those years.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the preparation of the Budget is a matter which is discussed at Cabinet.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The normal arrangement at the bilateral meetings is for the Minister to be accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department, the head of the Department's Corporate Services Division, and one or two other senior officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_3502">The bilateral meetings are normally preceded by extensive consultations at official level with the Department of Finance, and followed up with further communication at official level.  Therefore, it has not been the practice in recent years for an agenda to be circulated in advance or for my Department to take formal minutes of these meetings, although no instruction has been issued to that effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_3570">The establishment of an Innovation Voucher initiative was a key recommendation of the Small Business Forum in the 2006 report "Small Business is Big Business" and was also the subject of a commitment in the Programme for Government 2007-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3571">In March 2007, I announced the establishment of a €10m Innovation Voucher fund, which is being administered by Enterprise Ireland. The Innovation Vouchers initiative was initially launched on a pilot basis. Applications were sought from small businesses that have a business opportunity or problem that they wished to explore by accessing the knowledge in the third level sector in order to become more innovative. The programme has been designed to stimulate an on-going cultural shift with regard to innovation within the small business sector while bridging the gap that exists between the small business community and public research bodies and creating greater synergies between the two.</p>
            <p eId="para_3572">Each successful applicant received an Innovation Voucher worth €5,000 which can be used to facilitate knowledge transfer from the public research sector to small businesses. The vouchers can be used for any kind of business innovation such as developing a new product or service, improving service delivery or conducting a technology audit. The Vouchers are available to the widest possible range of small businesses in Ireland as permitted by European Union State Aid regulations and to a total of 66 sectors.   A total of 24 knowledge providers based all over Ireland, mainly in institutes of technology and universities, are now available to work with the companies that receive Innovation Vouchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3573">The pilot phase has met with a very positive response both from the small business sector and from knowledge providers. Building on the success of the pilot, further rounds of the programme have been launched. To date Enterprise Ireland has issued 530 Vouchers over five rounds, with a total redeemable value of €2.65 millions.

            <p eId="para_3575">The Small Business Forum in its 2006 report "Small Business is Big Business" sought that Knowledge Acquisition Grants would be provided to small businesses in Manufacturing &amp; Internationally Traded services.  The Programme for Government 2007-2012 contained a commitment that such grants would be provided to enable small business in the manufacturing and internationally traded service sectors gain access to research based knowledge, expertise and facilities in higher educational institutes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3576">Accordingly, as part of the revised and simplified Research and Development programme of initiatives introduced in January 2008, Enterprise Ireland has put in place a  €30,000 R&amp;D Stimulation Grant aimed at companies that are new to product, process and service development activities.  The financial support will allow the companies to explore how research &amp; innovation can drive their future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3577">The Enterprise Ireland R&amp;D Stimulation Grant provides funding to support activities such as:</p>

            <p eId="para_3583">The Government Strategy for Science Development and Innovation 2006-2013 has identified a seven year programme which aims to ensure that Ireland will be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress. In the delivery of this Strategy a number of Government Agencies including IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland have put in place a wide range of supports and schemes to fund leading edge research which will assist Irish companies to engage in research and development work that will lead to innovation and the practical application of research in their enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_3584">In January 2008 a revised and simplified Research and Development package of Programmes was introduced jointly by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA for Irish companies, that will be relevant at all stages of client development, and will seek to progress clients from small beginnings to high-level, sustained R&amp;D activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3585">In terms of the development of personnel within Irish enterprises, Enterprise Ireland is successfully providing tailored, results-oriented management development programmes in response to identified client needs by providing development programmes in areas identified as critical to growth.  This programme seeks to rapidly and effectively develop the capability of company management necessary to drive innovation and to support them in acquiring, developing and integrating the technologies and supporting knowledge required to effectively achieve high developmental goals of their companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3586">In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates a website "Openup" that provides information to help companies understand and use IT and eBusiness to improve competitiveness and grow sales by providing jargon-free, independent advice on information technology topics.  Specific assistance is provided on finding the right IT supplier; the tax implications of trading online; and the experience of other companies when they implemented eBusiness/ICT projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3587">Any further action required under this commitment, including the question of the appointment of a dedicated director, will be kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3590">The Expert Group have recently concluded their research on these items, including regional skills advisory groups and have presented their findings to both my Department and the Department of Education and Science.</p>

            <p eId="para_3597">The Office of Public Works (OPW) has primary responsibility for the procurement of suitable accommodation for both the advance and permanent re-location of decentralising Departments, including my Department's staff to Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  It is my understanding from the OPW that the yearly rental costs for this office is in the region of €369,000 and the fit-out costs were approximately €2,068,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">With regard to the property costs for the Department's permanent move to Carlow, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department's permanent office. I understand from the OPW that the site acquisition costs were €1,440,000.  My colleague,  Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the "Successful Tenderer" in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.  The OPW is responsible for costs in relation to this entire project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">With regard to non-property decentralisation costs incurred to date, the most recent figure for such costs for my Department, as submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance, relates to the period January 2004 to December 2007.  These amount to €184,647, broken down as follows — (Travel and Subsistence €11,298, Incidental €1,247, Postal &amp; Telecom €306, Office Machinery €129,854, Office Premises €15,322 and Consultancy €26,620).</p>

            <p eId="para_3671">Under the Lisbon Treaty, if ratified, sport will become one of the activities where the EU will have the right to carry out "actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of member states".  As such, Sports policy will remain a national competence in the same way as Education and Culture policies are currently treated within the framework of the EU.  The Treaty states that the Union can take action "to develop the European dimension in sport, by promoting fairness and openness in sporting competitions and cooperation between bodies responsible for sports".  It can also take action to protect "the physical and moral integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen especially the youngest".</p>
            <p eId="para_3672">In practice, this means that Parliament and Council will have the legal competence to adopt so-called "incentive measures" in the area of sport, using the co-decision procedure, which would be subject to Qualified Majority Voting at Council.  Similar measures adopted by the EU in the cultural and education field have been of significant benefit to Ireland (eg the ERASMUS Programme, the Culture 2007 and Media 2007 support programmes).  It is clear however that any such measures will not involve any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the member states.  Indeed, any Recommendations adopted by Council would not be legally binding on member states.</p>

            <p eId="para_3687">The position is that under the Sports Capital Programme, grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Department's interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  To date, €596,974 has been allocated to this group in 1999, 2006 &amp; 2007 under the Sports Capital Programme.  A Deed of Covenant and Charge was executed by the group on 16 March 2007 in relation to their 2006 grant allocation.  In this regard, the group's solicitors undertook to register the Deed of Covenant and Charge in the Land Registry (Property Registration Authority) within three months of receipt of the sealed Deeds.  The sealed Deed of Covenant and Charge in duplicate was sent to their offices on 28 March 2007 for the purpose of registration by the group's solicitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">I am advised by the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) that the Deed of Covenant and Charge has not yet been submitted to the Property Registration Authority for registration.  I am further advised by the CSSO that this registration will need to be attended to prior to the release of the 2007 grant.  The outstanding registration of the Deed of Covenant and Charge has been brought to the attention of the group's solicitors.  A checklist of the remaining requirements of the Chief State Solicitor's Office was also recently sent to the group's solicitors in relation to the 2007 grant allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">I understand from the CSSO that while they have briefly spoken to members of the group on a number of occasions, under Law Society rules their primary contact must be with the group's solicitors.</p>

            <p eId="para_3695">Since 1998 the Programme has allocated over €675 million to over 6,700 projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breath of the country.  Such large scale investments obliges my Department to follow good practice in relation the disbursement of public funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_3696">Every organisation that is provisionally allocated a grant under the programme receives a detailed letter setting out the terms and conditions that must be complied with prior to the grant being drawn down.  These include conditions relating to the submission of comparable quotes, valid tax clearance certificates as appropriate for the grantee and contractors and the putting in place of adequate legal protection for the State's investment.  This letter is accompanied by a simple to follow checklist to bring grantees through the draw down process.  While the Department is anxious that all grants awarded under the Programme are drawn down in a timely manner it is aware that on occasions delays may occur and in that context officials in my Department are available to assist with any such issues which arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_3742">Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3743">The position is that under the Sports Capital Programme, grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Minister's interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  To date, €260,000, which includes a Clar top-up grant of €30,000, has been allocated to this group and a Deed of Covenant and Charge is currently being drafted to cover this amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_3744">The grantees now wish to take out a loan for €160,000 and the bank in question also wish to place a legal charge on the grantee's property.  The ranking of charges placed on a grantee's land is regulated by means of a Priority Agreement.  In such situations it is my Department's established practice to seek a valuation of the lands in question from the grantees, so that it may determine whether the property may bear the burden of the combined charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_3745">In this instance the bank wishes their charge to rank first in priority.  The valuation provided by the grantees, however, estimates the land's value as being €260,000, which means that the combined value of the prospective bank loan and cumulative grant allocations is significantly in excess of the current valuation.  The Department has been requested to rank second on the Priority Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3746">You will appreciate that serious consideration must be given to this matter.  In this regard, the Department plans to respond through the CSSO to the grantee's solicitors in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3751">I have been advised by the Registrar General that the position is as set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3752">Following commencement of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 on 5 November, 2007, new processes and procedures were put in place to provide a universal system that recognises and underpins marriage as a solemn contract, and to streamline procedures to provide clarity on the formalities to be observed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3753">Section 46 of the Act requires that, save in exceptional circumstances, couples intending to marry in the state attend at the office of the registrar in person to give notification of intention to marry at least three months in advance of the intended marriage date, and to sign a declaration that there is no impediment to the marriage.  This provision also gives the registrar authority to request documentary evidence from each of the parties in relation to the verification of identity, current marital status, nationality etc.  Additional documentation may be required, for example,  where  either or both of the parties to the proposed marriage has had a divorce granted outside the state so that it can be determined whether it is entitled to recognition under Irish law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">Documentary evidence may also be required for the purposes of establishing the domicile of the parties to the divorce.  Any delay in the provision of the requested documentation inevitably delays a decision by the registrar on whether the couple are free to marry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">Registrars are acutely aware of the need to provide full and clear information as to documentary and other evidential requirements.  When couples make initial contact with a registrar, the requirements relating to documentation and procedures are explained.</p>
            <p eId="para_3756">Section 48 of the Act provides for the issue of a Marriage Registration Form (MRF), without which no marriage may be legally solemnised. In essence, this form constitutes the approval of the registrar to the marriage proceeding. An MRF will be issued only when the registrar is satisfied that all the statutory requirements for a valid marriage have been met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3757">The new procedures have been well advertised and seminars were held around the country for religious solemnisers in the weeks preceding the commencement of the provisions. Comprehensive guidelines have been published for religious solemnisers and couples intending to marry. The guidelines may be obtained from any registrar or downloaded from the General Register Office website at www.groireland.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3758">The Deputy will appreciate that, owing to the constitutional and legal implications of marriage, all reasonable measures must be taken to protect the integrity of marriage and to ensure the international acceptability of certificates of marriage produced by this country as evidence of a valid marriage.</p>

            <p eId="para_3760">When a person dies, it is the duty of a relative of the deceased to act as qualified informant.  This means that the relative must give to a registrar of births, deaths and marriages the information necessary to register the death, including a medical certificate of the cause of death, which is obtainable from the medical practitioner who attended the deceased, and sign the register of deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_3761">In certain circumstances, a death is referred to the Coroner.  There is a legal responsibility on doctors, registrars, undertakers, Gardai, hospitals and nursing homes to inform the Coroner where a death occurs suddenly or unexpectedly, or from a cause unknown, unclear or unnatural, or where the deceased was not seen or treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month prior to death.</p>
            <p eId="para_3762">In such cases, the Coroner may request a post-mortem examination.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to natural causes, the Coroner may issue a certificate to the Registrar, who can then proceed to register the death and issue a death certificate.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to unnatural causes, the Coroner may cause an inquest to be held.  In such cases, the Registrar must await the outcome of the inquest and the issue by the Coroner of a coroner's certificate before the death can be registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3763">An tArd Chláraitheoir (Registrar General), who has statutory responsibility for the civil registration system, is not aware of any particular reason for the delay in issuing a death certificate in the case of the person concerned (details supplied) other than that the death in question has not been registered as yet.  A relative of the deceased should contact the nearest Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages as soon as possible in order to effect registration.</p>

            <p eId="para_3765">The Department operates two main types of pension scheme; contributory and non-contributory payments. Contributory payments are paid on the basis of social insurance contributions made over a person's working life. Missionaries who have made sufficient social insurance contributions can qualify for the state pension (contributory).  These pensions are payable abroad and so missionaries who qualify, and who live or work abroad, can receive a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">Non-contributory pensions are only payable where a person is resident in this country and those applying for such pensions must also satisfy the habitual residency condition (HRC).  Accordingly, missionaries who reside abroad cannot receive a non-contributory pension. However, those who retire here permanently are generally deemed to satisfy the HRC and will, subject to satisfying a means test, qualify for a payment.</p>

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has set down a number of factors to be considered when deciding whether someone is "habitually resident".  The Court has determined that five factors are relevant in determining whether a person is habitually resident, and these grounds are specified in Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3773">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p>
            <p eId="para_3774">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_3775">(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;</p>
            <p eId="para_3776">(d) the person's main centre of interest, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3777">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3778">An Irish national returning to this country having lived abroad for a number of years, would have their entitlement to Social Welfare payment assessed in the context of the factors outlined above.  It is likely that a person returning to live permanently in this country would satisfy the requirements of the habitual residence condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3779">Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. The Habitual Residence Condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that persons whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3783">Family income supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family's net earnings and the number of children under aged 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3784">Where self employment is the sole employment in a household, Family Income Supplement is not payable.  Arrangements already exist whereby self employed people on low earnings can receive additional payments under the social welfare system. Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance (UA) appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim assistance.  The rate of assistance payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year, and all expenses necessarily incurred by the applicant in carrying out the business are disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_3785">Representational Payments are insurable at PRSI class M and Councillors are regarded as office holders in the same manner as TDs, MEPs Senators and members of the judiciary.  Under Social Welfare Regulations (Article 27 of SI 312/96) all emoluments received in respect of the office held are exempt from Social Insurance with the exception of the Health Levy.  A Representational Payment is therefore considered to be an emolument from self-employment and treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3792">Following improvements made to the qualifying income thresholds for family income supplement (FIS) in recent budgets and publicity campaigns promoting the scheme, there has been a substantial increase in the scheme take-up.</p>

            <p eId="para_3806">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the Homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.   However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3807">The operation of this scheme is subject to review in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.  Also, alternative means of providing pensions for homemakers, and others at present outside the social welfare pension system, are also explored in the Green Paper, including the use of universal entitlements with qualifying criteria based around residence rather than contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3808">A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until 31 May.  Once the consultation process is completed, work on developing the framework for future policy in all areas of pension provision will commence. The aim is to finalise proposals by the end of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3833">Entitlement to carer's allowance/benefit is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3834">The average time for deciding a claim for carer's allowance is currently 18 weeks.  The number of claims for carers allowance submitted in 2007 was 18,000 compared to 10,700 in 2006.  This represents an increase of 68% on the total received in 2006.   A total of 7,000 new applications for Carer's Allowance have been received this year to date (week end 2nd May 2008).  The large increase in applications received is mainly due to the introduction of the half rate carer's allowance payment which came into effect from 27 September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">Entitlement to Carer's Benefit is based on an applicant satisfying medical, employment and PRSI contribution conditions. In determining entitlement to the Benefit there are in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the benefit are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.  The average time for deciding a claim for carer's benefit is currently 9 weeks. The number of claims for carer's benefit submitted in 2007 was 3,469 compared to 2,616 in 2006.  This represents on average an annual increase of 33%.</p>

            <p eId="para_3837">The person concerned applied for jobseeker's allowance on 8 February 2008.  A Deciding Officer approved his claim on 14 April 2008 and awarded him jobseeker's allowance at the weekly rate of €56.80 from 8 February 2008 and he was notified accordingly.  However, the person concerned failed to sign the live register on 8 April 2008 and consequently his claim was closed from 15 April 2008.  If he is currently unemployed he should contact his local Social Welfare Office, to discuss the matter.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3839">The Bereavement Grant is a payment designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.  It is a scheme that relates specifically to those who have made PRSI contributions and is payable on the death of an insured person, his/her spouse and dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education. In order to qualify for the bereavement grant the deceased must have:</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">a total of 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, or</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">at least 26 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the Relevant Tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3842">The application for Bereavement Grant in respect of this person was received on 19 March 2008.  Following extensive searches, this Department was unable to trace any record of contributions paid by the person or her spouse.  Accordingly, on 4th April 2008 the Department notified the deceased person's son that there was no entitlement to the Bereavement Grant as the PRSI conditions were not satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for bereavement grant a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under this arrangement, the local Community Welfare Officer may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet from their own resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3845">The Minister for Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas advised me last week that he has decided that the Ballymun area merits designation as an area of regeneration for the purposes of Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. This section of the Act provides that rent supplement shall not be payable in general, the objective being to achieve social integration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">The measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration.  Specific provision is made to ensure that:</p>
            <p eId="para_3847">people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3848">people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted.  Arrangements will be made by all parties to ensure that vulnerable groups or individuals who are dependent on rent supplement now or may be so dependant in the future are adequately catered for in Ballymun.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">Officials of my Department are currently examining the request to invoke the provisions of Section 25 in the Ballymun regeneration area, with a view to ensuring that all operational issues arising, are identified and resolved prior to implementation. It is not intended that the Section 25 provisions will be open-ended.  Once in place, the arrangements will be kept under review by both Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_4066">As the Deputy will be aware, the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013 represents my Department's response to the commitment in the Programme for Government in relation to rural enterprise development. In that regard, I hope to be in a position to commence the process of selecting the Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme in the near future.   The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-13 will amount to €425.4 million — almost treble the €150 million available for the 2000-06 period.  The new Programme will complement the other funding for rural development measures by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4067">The Deputy will be aware that my Department has over the past number of years been pursuing a process of cohesion of local delivery structures in order to simplify and enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of a range of local development programmes.  Following extensive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, in the course of 2007, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development groups and clarified the arrangements in relation to the membership of the boards of these bodies.  LEADER and Partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_4068">The realignment of local delivery structures will reduce the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 55, comprising 17 Partnerships in urban areas and 38 integrated LEADER/Partnership bodies in rural areas.  My intention is to have the cohesion process completed in advance of the roll out of the new NDP programmes, including the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme. At this stage, local development bodies are in place in some 54 of the 55 operational areas agreed by Government.  I understand that steps are now being taken to complete the establishment of an appropriate structure in the remaining area. It is expected that this process will be completed shortly.</p>

My Department is responsible for the implementation of Axes 3 and 4 of the Rural Development Programme Affairs through a network of Local Action Groups and my officials were accordingly involved in the negotiation of these axes, alongside the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_4071">It was been agreed with the Commission that all Axis 3 measures, including those to support improvements to the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification and development of the rural economy, will be delivered through Axis 4 (LEADER Axis) of the Rural Development Programme. All Axis 4 activities will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 55%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4072">There are no specific proposals to target coastal communities under the Rural Development Programme, rather such communities will benefit in the wider rural development context from the significant investments that will be delivered by the Programme.  My Department has liaised with BIM and many other stakeholders in relation to the Rural Development Programme and will continue to do so as the Programme is implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_4166">I am currently considering certain proposals from the farming organizations on aspects of the mixed grazing supplementary measure.  Ultimately, however, REPS is a voluntary, demand-led scheme and it is open to farmers to opt for the measure, for which sufficient funding is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_4171">I have no plans at present to introduce a Scheme to aid the purchase of harvesting machinery for bioenergy crops. In 2007, I introduced a new Bioenergy Scheme offering establishment grants of up to €1,450 per hectare to farmers to plant willow and miscanthus. Some 800 hectares were grant aided in 2007. One of the main advantages of these crops is that harvesting operations can be carried out with conventional farm machinery. Miscanthus, for example can be harvested using traditional harvest machinery including mowers, balers and forage harvesters. Willow can be harvested by adapting conventional farm harvesting machinery such as forage harvesters. Specialised machinery to harvest willow is also available and in use.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">The Department has published Best Practice guidelines for growing willow and miscanthus under the Bioenergy Scheme. Among other items, the guide provides advice to growers on planting and harvesting operations to maximise crop yield and improve the economic viability of the crop. Teagasc recently published a new Farm Diversification Manual, which provides detailed technical advice to farmers on the cultivation of energy crops including willow and miscanthus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4173">Areas planted with bioenergy crops qualify for the Single Farm Payment, the National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare and the EU Premium of €45 per hectare under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. The second phase of the Bioenergy Scheme commenced in December 2007 and to date applications to plant a further 1,400 hectares of willow and miscanthus have been submitted.</p>

            <p eId="para_4176">I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 356 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4177">REPS is a agri-environmental measure, and for that reason payments to farmers must be costed and justified on the basis of quantifiable environmental benefits that go beyond keeping land in good agricultural and environmental condition and observing the statutory management requirements of the Single Payment Scheme.  No element of the REPS payment can be justified on the basis of a production support, nor can a farmer be compensated for the same action twice.  REPS is not a support scheme; it is a voluntary scheme open to all farmers and payments under the scheme are not entitlements as of right.  Participants who agree to be bound by the scheme conditions qualify for payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4178">The maximum area of miscanthus permitted on REPS farms is 10 hectares or 25% of the REPS contract area, whichever is the greater. This area limitation is in order to maintain landscape diversity. It would not be desirable or acceptable in an agri-environmental scheme to have whole farms, or a major portion of the lands, devoted to the growing of an introduced species monoculture.  Existing levels of flora and fauna need to be sustained, and if possible improved, on all REPS farms and the large-scale growing of miscanthus is not consistent with this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_4179">Four-metre margins are necessary to allow for routine hedgerow maintenance which can take place only when the crop is standing in the field, and to protect against invasion by the miscanthus root system into field boundaries. This crop can attain heights of more than three metres which can result in deep shading of field margins and associated hedgerow habitats.  Consequently the margins must be wide enough to prevent indigenous plant species being deprived of light.  Hedgerows are the only refuge for indigenous plant species associated with the former grassland or tillage field use, and they must be kept in a condition that is adequate to provide for diversity of flora and fauna to be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_4181">The concept "conservation agriculture"in the context of tillage undoubtedly embraces at least the principles of minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with plants or residues and the use of crop rotations and cover crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_4182">Minimal soil disturbance by the use of alternatives to ploughing is increasingly being practised in Ireland.  The current Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS 4) recognizes the importance of minimum soil disturbance and incorporates a measure to encourage greater uptake of shallow non-soil inversion crop establishment, for which the farmer will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">Although the other principles I have referred to are not associated exclusively with conservation, all Irish tillage farmers would regard permanent crop cover and crop rotation as good practice.  There is a benefit to water quality as well, and for that reason the principles outlined above feature in the Nitrates Regulations (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give effect to the Nitrates Directive.  Article 21 of the Regulations, which apply to all agricultural holdings, governs ploughing and the use of non-selective herbicides.</p>
            <p eId="para_4184">These principles were also taken on board when standards for Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) were drawn up for Ireland in the context of cross compliance under the Single Payment Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4250">As part of the control procedures under EU legislation governing these Schemes, the application was randomly selected for and was the subject of a ground eligibility and animal identification and registration inspection</p>
            <p eId="para_4251">During the course of the ground eligibility inspection discrepancies were found with four parcels. As a result of this discrepancy the claimed area of 58.24ha was reduced to 31.62ha. The person named was informed of these findings on the 22nd October 2007. If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, penalties will be applied in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Single Payment Scheme. In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 58.04. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 20%, under EU Regulations, no payment is due.</p>
            <p eId="para_4252">A request to review the findings of this eligibility inspection has been received. The officer in charge is currently examining this review and the person named will be informed of the outcome within the next two weeks.

            <p eId="para_4256">A good deal of work has already been undertaken and significant progress has been made on drafting the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill and I intend, very shortly, to initiate a process of public consultation by publishing a consultation paper and inviting submissions from interested parties and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">The Bill will be a comprehensive piece of legislation which will, inter alia, give effect to a number of important commitments, in the area of animal health and welfare, contained in the Programme for Government.  The Bill will amend and consolidate previous legislation to reflect the changed disease status of our nation's animals and update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) is properly protected and that penalties for offenders are increased significantly as well as replacing and repealing a long list of outdated legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4258">Drafting of the Bill will continue after the consultation process, having regard to the various submissions received.</p>
            <p eId="para_4259">Licensed fur farms are inspected to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have, to date, found that licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current national and EU legislation.  In this regard fur farming is a legitimate farming activity, which is permitted in the greater majority of EU Member States.  It is intended that the forthcoming legislation will provide for the continuation of normal farming, sporting and other activities where these do not involve reckless endangerment of the welfare of animals.</p>

These issues, some of which are not within the remit of my Department are being examined and a detailed response will issue in due course. I am eager to support the development of miscanthus in Ireland and I am making grant aid available to growers under the Bioenergy Scheme. The Scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in February 2007 and provides establishment grants of up to €1,450 per hectare. Some 700 hectares of miscanthus were planted in 2007. In September 2007, my Department met with all the stakeholders including the aforementioned association to review the operation of the Bioenergy Scheme. All stakeholders were complimentary towards the Scheme and acknowledged it had stimulated considerable interest among farmers. The second phase was launched in December 2007 and so far applications to plant a further 1,300 hectares of miscanthus have been submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4286">In addition to establishment grants, areas planted with miscanthus also qualify for the Single Farm Payment, the National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare, the EU Premium of €45 per hectare under the EU Energy Crops Scheme and adjusted payments under the REPS and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4292">The following incentives are available from my Department to encourage farmers to produce bio-fuel feedstocks (energy crops).</p>
            <p eId="para_4293">An EU premium of €45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4294">A National Energy Crop Premium worth €80 per hectare.</p>
            <p eId="para_4295">50% establishment grants for willow and miscanthus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4296">Areas sown with energy crops may also qualify for the single farm payment. The Department's agencies do not pay direct subsidies for bio-fuel production. Teagasc provide advisory services to farmers to develop more efficient production systems generally and improve crop yields. Research undertaken by Teagasc assesses the opportunities provided by bio-fuel crops and communicates this information to farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4297">I have no plans to review the energy crop incentives given the relatively small area devoted to energy crop cultivation in Ireland. The percentage of agricultural land under energy crops in 2007 was less than 0.02% comprising some 9,000 hectares. Teagasc estimate that potentially some 75,000-100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on food or animal feed production. There is potential to expand the feedstock base with the advent of new second-generation bio-fuels, which use non-food feedstocks such as wood biomass.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">The current rise in food prices is largely associated with rising world population and increased demand in some rapidly developing economies where demand is outstripping supply. Other factors include declining stocks of grain, speculation in commodity futures, higher energy costs and export restrictions imposed by some countries. The diversion of more land to produce bio-fuels, particularly corn-derived ethanol in the USA contributed to the surge in cereal prices in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">In response to the current high prices for cereals and the abolition by the EU of compulsory set aside, extra land is being devoted to cereal production in Ireland and across the Community in 2008. It is forecast that the 2008 wheat crop in the EU could increase by 17m tonnes compared to 2007. As crops for bio-fuels, are estimated to account for about 3m-4m tonnes of production, the additional 13m tonnes of cereals at EU level should help increase the availability of stocks for food and animal feed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">In 2007, the EU Commission carried out an ‘Impact Assessment' to assess the effect of the 10% bio-fuel target on transport fuel on EU-27 agricultural markets in 2020. The assessment concluded that the 10% bio-fuel scenario would not overly stretch land availability, and as a consequence food production. The EU Commission recently proposed new sustainability criteria for bio-fuels, that are counted towards the 10% target. As part of the monitoring and reporting system for bio-fuel production, the Commission will be required to analyse, among other items, the impact of EU bio-fuel policy on the availability of foodstuffs in exporting countries, the ability of people in developing countries to afford these foodstuffs and wider development issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_4301">The reality is that bio-fuel production is currently one of the few practical ways of making a real impact on oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Nonetheless the objective should be to ensure that bio-fuels, are produced in a sustainable fashion and not have undesirable consequences for food production, the environment and biodiversity.</p>

            <p eId="para_4314">Ireland has been and continues to be bluetongue-free and the presence of the disease in a number of other Member States has had very little impact on Irish agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_4315">While a small number of imported animals that were tested on their arrival here were found to have been exposed to the virus in the past, they were found to be free of the virus and, as such, posed no threat to animal health, having developed a natural immunity to the virus.  Consequently, the issue of compensation raised by the Deputy doesn't arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4316">As there has been no outbreak of bluetongue in this country, the issue of establishing protection, surveillance and restricted zones does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4317">My Department has carried out a number of assessments to seek to determine the risk of the possible introduction of the disease into the country and, based on the assessed level of risk, my predecessor has taken a number of initiatives to minimise that risk, including the introduction of a ban on the importation of female breeding and production cattle aged over 12 months and female sheep over 6 months, following confirmation that the presence of the virus had been detected in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4318">That particular measure has now been revoked following the introduction of tighter movement controls of animals from bluetongue-restricted areas that were introduced earlier this week, which impose further restrictions on the animals that may now be imported to this country from bluetongue-restricted areas and their application in Ireland.  These further measures are discretionary for Member States but their application in Ireland is in line with our commitment to maintain the country's disease-free status.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">It will be my objective to ensure that we make every effort and take all such reasonable precautions as we can to ensure that Ireland remains disease-free.</p>

            <p eId="para_4333">The Youth Affairs Section of my Department supports a number of schemes and initiatives which provide non-formal educational opportunities for young people throughout the country through voluntary participation in youth work. This support consists mainly of grant-in-aid assistance for national and major regional youth work organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, targeted youth work responses for young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund which targets young people at risk from substance misuse. Grant-in-aid funding is made available as a contribution towards the general running expenses, including staffing costs, of projects. My Department does not operate a capital funding programme in respect of the youth work sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4334">A number of youth projects funded under these schemes are located in the Dublin 8 area. Details of the projects and schemes are outlined hereunder:</p>

            <p eId="para_4367">Preventative measures are in place such as the School Completion Programme with €31.160 million allocated to the School Completion Programme for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">School Completion Programme (SCP) is based on a set of key principles, with a strong emphasis being placed on partnership between schools, family members and local statutory, community and voluntary agencies and on the concept of integrated services. Effective support requires a cross-community and cross sectoral response to young people's needs, with support being provided on a continuous basis both during, and outside of, school time. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP), and up to 2007 with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
            <p eId="para_4369">Over €580,000 has been allocated for 2007/08 to projects in the Dublin 8 area where supports are offered in-school, after-school, out-of-school and during holiday time in recognition of the fact that continuous support must be given to young people at risk of early school leaving. After-school activities are delivered as part of the School Completion Programme and homework clubs in particular are a widely implemented support to provide students with a structured environment to complete homework. After-School Supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of young people, aiming to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into the many talents of young people. Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork and Sport enable children to develop a range of creative and sporting skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_4370">Holiday Time Supports are delivered during holiday time, for example, mid-term break, Easter and Summer holidays. Holiday time supports are provided to young people at risk of early school leaving in order to provide a consistent educational experience for them all year round. Holiday supports are often delivered in conjunction with other external agencies, particularly youth services.</p>

            <p eId="para_4384">Existing education policy is that students up to 18 years of age are admitted to primary and second level schools irrespective of their nationality or status.  Indeed, under the Equal Status Act, schools may not discriminate in admission to schools except where this is necessary to maintain the religious values or ethos of the school.  While the Act does provide for differential treatment in relation to fees for further and higher education for persons who are not nationals of an EU Member State, there is no such condition specified in regard to second level schools.  The admission of persons to the State from outside the EU is a matter for the immigration authorities. Children of refugees, those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, asylum seekers and dependents of certain work permit holders, are entitled to access free first and second level education. However, the basic conditions for a student visa require that the student attend a full time programme of education and training, pay the appropriate fees and be financially self supporting. Such students have no entitlements to bring their dependents with them to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">The Report on the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Internationalisation of Irish Education, published in 2004, set out a strategy with the objective of enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a quality venue for international students and increasing the numbers of students coming to Ireland to participate in further and higher education and training and in the language sector.  It was envisaged that students from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland, other than refugees and those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, would participate on a fee paying basis.  In the course of the discussions leading to the Report, the position of minors attending school for second level education was discussed, and the existing immigration policy that student visas should be allowed only in respect of attendance at fee-paying schools was confirmed, on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State. My Department is in continuing discussion with officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the proposals in the Immigration and Residence Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_4386">On the issue of work permits, Section 24.2 of Towards 2016 provides that the employment of non EU/EEA students will be made subject to work permits, and the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment is currently drawing up proposals for the implementation of this commitment.  It is proposed that such permits will not be the subject of a labour market test. This is part of an overall strategy to help ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect employment rights, that minimum wage and registered employment agreements are adhered to, and that migration policy is underpinned by appropriate administrative arrangements.</p>

Gorey is one of the areas designated as a rapidly developing area and my announcement on 1 February last refers to projects commencing construction in 2008.  Planning Permission has since been granted and this will allow for the commencement and construction of two 8 classroom schools for Gorey in 2008.  The 22 new primary schools mentioned in a recent newspaper report that the Deputy refers to are in connection with the recognition of new primary schools by the New Schools Advisory Committee.  Gorey was not mentioned on this list as the schools are already established.</p>

            <p eId="para_4400">A grant of €484,000 was sanctioned under the Small Schools Scheme to enable the management authority of the school in question to extend and modernise their school.  The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project.  The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.  The current position is that the school management have appointed a contractor and building works have commenced.  I understand that an application for additional funding will be submitted for consideration by the Department.  The school will be informed of the decision in duecourse.</p>

            <p eId="para_4402">This issue relates to the impact of providing an immersion model of education in Irish medium schools under which no English is taught for a significant part of the infant cycle.  The NCCA indicated that the research available was not adequate to come to firm recommendations applicable in the Irish context, and accordingly recommended that research be undertaken on a range of models, with different Irish medium schools taking different start dates for the introduction of English.  The question of deferring a decision in relation to this matter pending a research project to ascertain the impact on student performance of various models of immersion education was considered.  Such research would take a considerable time to complete, and is likely to be inconclusive, given the many variables (socioeconomic status, school practice, variations in first language at home of students etc) that are at play here.  In any event, research will, by its nature, focus on but one subset (learning impact) of what is a significantly wider public policy matter and for that reason I did not consider it appropriate to delay a decision pending any such research.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">It is a requirement in all schools that all subjects of the curriculum are taught to all class groups.  In the Introduction to the Primary Curriculum (page 27) it is stated that "It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages."  It is important that all children have access to a balanced education and benefit from the full curriculum at the earliest possible stage.  Oral language development plays a critically important role in early learning and I believe it is important to ensure that tuition in both Irish and English is provided for children in the infant cycle.  Accordingly, circular 044/2007 issued in July last to schools requiring Irish medium schools to provide the minimum recommended tuition in English, of least 2.5 hours per week, for the infant classes with a shorter day (and 3.5 hours per week for those attending for the full day) with effect from no later than the start of the second term in junior infants.  This provides that between 88% and 90% of the overall provision in such schools is through the medium of Irish, with all subjects being taught through Irish, except English.</p>

            <p eId="para_4423">Major school building projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria.  The banding system was introduced following agreement with the Education Partners in 2004.  Applications can range from extensions and refurbishments to applications for new schools on new sites.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.  The banding system can be broadly set out as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4424">Band 1 — Projects serving rapidly developing areas, schools with special needs requirements, rationalisation projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_4425">Band 2 — Projects dealing with deficits of mainstream accommodation.  It is not uncommon, given current demographic trends, for projects in this category to move from minor projects to more substantial projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_4428">It would not be realistic to try to estimate the potential cost of all building projects on hand in my Department. A variety of factors can affect the final cost of a project.  Site size/conditions, demographic trends, technical assessment of the existing buildings etc., requirement for new buildings, extension to existing schools or refurbishment of existing schools will all affect the cost of the various projects, as will the trend in building costs in the broader economy.  Ultimately, it is only when a project has been tendered that an accurate cost becomes available.</p>

            <p eId="para_4450">The position in relation to enrolment in Scoil Oisín, Phoenix Park, Dublin 15 has been under review in the context of overall requirements for primary school places in the wider area.  The planned opening this September of Scoil Oisín is to be postponed following a review of overall enrolment figures for the area which indicate that the new school will not now be required for the next school year.  Scoil Oisín is one of three schools due to come under the patronage of County Dublin VEC as part of a new pilot patronage model, the details of which were announced  in December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4451">It is intended that the school will eventually serve the community around the new residential development on the site of the old Phoenix Park racecourse.  A slower pace of development on that site has resulted in a reduction of projected demand for school places in the area this year.  The parents of children who had sought places in Scoil Oisín this coming September have all been contacted and offered alternative places in nearby schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4452">The two other schools under the new pilot patronage model, Scoil Choilm, Porterstown, Dublin 15, which opened last year under temporary arrangements, and a new school, Scoil Ghráinne, Phibblestown, Dublin 15, will both be accepting pupils this September having shown strong enrolment numbers for this September.</p>

            <p eId="para_4499">My Department has a strong record in developing low energy educational buildings.  For the past eight years my Department has been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology.  Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design the Department have taken a more holistic approach and have developed our technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.  There is particular emphasis on elimination of over design, improved thermal envelope design and improved passive solar design, natural ventilation and day lighting along with advanced heating and lighting controls.  It has been demonstrated that all Primary School's designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">The application of wind energy schemes in schools has been explored by my Department and the results indicate that given the scale of application to match demand and capacity in a meaningful way schools are better placed to connect to one of the main wind energy electrical suppliers to maximise the potential of green electricity.  This is kept under review given improvements in technology and the market place.  The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and just recently by the Taoiseach's Public Service Excellence Awards held in Dublin Castle Conference Centre on Friday, 18th April 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_4567">Schools are privately managed institutions which, although funded by the State, enjoy a large degree of autonomy.  It is, therefore, primarily a matter for each school to devise guidelines around the types of food that is available on the school premises and such policies should be driven by the needs and welfare of the pupils.  I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents' associations and I would encourage others to do so also.</p>
            <p eId="para_4568">In relation to schools/colleges provided under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model my Department has to date entered into three separate contracts.

In the contracts agreed for the five Pilot Schools while the Operator is responsible for the vending machines the location, content and availability of vending machines were agreed through discussion between the Operator and the School Authorities concerned.  The contract stipulate that, if catering and/or vending is provided, the PPP Operator must pay a guaranteed income to the authority regardless of the level of net income received from these services.</p>

The Deputy will also be aware of the construction of a school in Porterstown to accommodate Scoil Choilm.  In the context of this building project being delivered against a very demanding timescale, the Department considered it prudent to progress the project to which the deputy refers as a contingency measure. Because the requirement for school or other educational accommodation can arise at very short notice, and in the context of anticipated overall growth in future years, my Department also considered it prudent to have a facility available for use to provide an immediate solution to these needs should they arise.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if he will establish a student accommodation taskforce as urgently as possible in relation to the accommodation needs of third level students. 
        [17865/08]

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_827">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4576">I am aware that there has been a call for the establishment of a taskforce on student accommodation.  However, this is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While I would be concerned if accommodation difficulties are impacting on students' performance at college, my Department has no remit in relation to student accommodation.  My Department does not provide financial assistance for the provision of student accommodation nor has it any funding available to do so.  Capital funding under the NDP for higher education is targeted at delivering core educational facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4577">Neither does my Department have any expertise or knowledge in relation to housing supply or housing policy in general.  Any analysis of student accommodation in a particular locality would have to take account of the availability of other rented accommodation in that area.  Any proposals would have to be considered in the context of national housing policy as set by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4578">As the Deputy will be aware, a number of initiatives have been taken by the Government to improve the availability of student accommodation in recent years.  Section 50 of the Finance Act 1999 incentivised the provision of dedicated student residential accommodation, while the Rent a Room tax relief introduced in 2001 has encouraged private householders to rent out rooms to students.</p>
            <p eId="para_4579">A review of the Section 50 tax exemption by Indecon consultants for the Department of Finance in 2006 concluded that it had served its purpose and that oversupply was potentially developing as an issue.  As a result the scheme will be phased out in 2008 although the tax relief will apply for 10 years from the date that the property is first let to students.  The Deputy will also be aware that there have been record increases in the overall housing stock, with over 700,000 new housing units built over the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4580">Notwithstanding all of this, I am conscious that student representatives believe that there is a shortage of suitable rented accommodation in the Dublin area in particular.  My colleague, Minister Gormley, has recently suggested commissioning a study from the Centre for Housing Research on the availability of rented accommodation for students in the greater Dublin region.  I am pleased to state I have signalled to him that my Department is willing to co-fund such a study, subject to agreement of terms of reference and costs. Discussions are continuing at official level in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4622">The Minister of State for Integration Policy, appointed under the previous Government, was responsible for integration policy functions in my Department relating to the following.  Ensuring that the range of education policies across different areas of the Department and the bodies under its aegis take account of the need to integrate immigrants and their families, in particular in relation to further development of policy in relation to the deployment of language support teachers for newcomers in schools; appropriate teaching materials, supports and advice for schools on how to meet the needs of newcomer children; development, in conjunction with other relevant Departments and agencies, of a national policy on the provision of English language education for adult newcomers; implementation of the Department of Education and Science aspects of the National Action Plan against Racism; liaison with education partners (management bodies, unions, parents, representatives of school principals) on newcomer issues; review of international developments and trends in relation to newcomers; development of appropriate linkages with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland on newcomer issues; co-ordinating the work of the Department of Education and Science on the integration of newcomers with the related work of other relevant Departments and State Agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_4625">Education legislation requires that the diversity of educational provision in the State is taken account of, and the right of parents to send their children to a school of their choice is respected under Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the onscience of the parent of the student. The Rules for National Schools also provide, where the parents or guardians so wish, for the withdrawal of pupils from religious instruction.</p>
            <p eId="para_4626">Section 15 of the Education Act 1998 requires boards of management of schools to uphold and be accountable to the Patron for upholding the characteristic spirit of the school including the moral, religious, social, educational and spiritual values which inform the ethos of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4627">At primary level, the Department of Education and Science recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation.  This right is enshrined in the Education Act 1998. Consequently, although religious education is part of the Curriculum for Primary Schools and schools are obliged to allocate 30 minutes per day for religious instruction, the content of the religion programme is determined by the Patron of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4628">The Revised Curriculum for Primary Schools espouses the importance of tolerance towards the practice, culture and life-style of a range of religious convictions and states explicitly that the beliefs and sensibilities of every child are to be respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4629">In second level schools, a programme of religious instruction approved by the Patron may be offered, or alternatively, the school may use the curriculum in Religious Education which has been designed as an examinable subject by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The NCCA syllabuses are concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and are designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none.  At Junior Cycle, the NCCA syllabus in Religious Education was introduced in September 2000 for first examination in the Junior Certificate in 2003.  At Senior Cycle, a new NCCA syllabus in Religious Education at Higher and Ordinary levels was introduced for first examination in 2005</p>
            <p eId="para_4630">As the Deputy is aware, a new model of primary school patronage is to be piloted from September 2008 in response to changing societal circumstances.  The pilot schools, which will come under the patronage of County Dublin VEC, will aim to provide religious education as part of the school day for diverse denominational groups, reflecting parental choice and based on an ethos of inclusion and respect for children of all faiths and none.  The content and approach to religious education in the pilot schools will be developed in partnership with the relevant interests, and evaluated over the course of the pilot phase.</p>

         the steps taken to identify and support the 28,000 children at risk of early school leaving, which is a task charged to school completion as set out in the Annual Output Statement 2008; the methodology to be employed; the agency or agencies with responsibility for the task; the resources available to induce or secure continued school attendance by the group at risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_847">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4705">In the region of €730 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels from pre-school to further and higher education. This represents an increase of over 60% and is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school. Social inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4706">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_4707">The service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes, after school and holiday time supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_4708">In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present. The action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4709">We have widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.</p>
            <p eId="para_4710">In the current school year, grants totalling almost €19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS (the Action plan for Educational Inclusion). These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4711">Preventative measures are also in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL), with €31.160 million allocated to the School Completion Programme and in the region of €30 million allocated to HSCL for 2008. Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time- all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children's education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.   Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4712">The objective of the School Completion Programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process, entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. It is based on the project model with an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents and relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and up to 2007 with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
            <p eId="para_4713">82 projects were selected to participate in the School Completion Programme in 2002. This number has increased, under DEIS, to 124 projects spanning 26 counties, comprising 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4714">A local management committee, comprising of representatives of schools and other relevant agencies, manage each project. Projects are required to engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies in the development of annual retention plans. What makes the School Completion Programme unique is its ‘bottom up' approach, which allows the local management committees to put together plans and supports that target the needs of local young people at risk of early school leaving. Each project employs a local Co-ordinator to run the project at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">The School Completion Programme identifies young people at risk of early school leaving and aims to provide a range of supports for them in-school and in the community, through linkages with relevant community, youth and statutory agencies.  The factors contributing to why young people leave school prior to completing senior cycle are multi- faceted, such as poor school attendance, poor literacy/numeracy, behavioural problems, family history of early school leaving, socio-economic to mention a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_4716">Local Management Committees establish criteria for targeting students at risk of leaving school early.  Each local project develops its own set of criteria based on local circumstances and local need. As SCP targets, in the main, young people most at risk of early school leaving but still in the formal education system, projects have developed criteria identified in research and practice that cause young people to be at risk of early school leaving. This approach allows local flexibility and local knowledge to inform the process of identifying young people at risk of early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_4717">SCP projects target and focus programme resources in the first instance on the individual young people who are most at risk of early school leaving. Additionally, some strategies may include a wider group (e.g. in the case of sporting and leisure activities) or the entire school population (e.g. where tracking attendance is involved).</p>
            <p eId="para_4718">The National Co-ordination Team have also published Guidelines on Identifying Young People at Risk of Early School Leaving in order to assist SCP projects identify good practices for targeting young people at risk of early school leaving. Projects have adopted consultative processes to review criteria lists, notably through projects' review days and also through formal and informal meetings with relevant stakeholders throughout the academic year. Local management committee meetings provide an opportunity for criteria to be reviewed and also provide space to projects that need to look at prioritising students on the target list.</p>
            <p eId="para_4719">I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years to keep more young people in school and  I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4721">My Department is aware of the document referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4722">Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4723">The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force.  To qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme, an applicant must be, inter alia, in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months in the case of people wishing to complete a second-level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third-level qualifications. However, there is provision under the scheme for persons awarded statutory redundancy to access the BTEA scheme provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_4724">The BTEA scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the scheme.   I understand that the requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme and this eligibility criterion is necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed towards those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_4725">People who are already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the BTEA scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4726">Students who qualify for the standard rate of maintenance grant under each of my Department's four maintenance grant schemes may, under certain circumstances, qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant. In order to qualify for the special rate, a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_4727">1. An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant;</p>
            <p eId="para_4728">2. Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant maintenance grant schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_4729">3. As at the prescribed date, i.e., 31st December each year, the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4730">The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2007/2008 is €18,055.</p>
            <p eId="para_4731">The Deputy will be aware that I have recently published the Student Support Bill 2008. This Bill will provide a statutory framework for reforming the administration of student grants and a coherent basis for a new single unified scheme of student maintenance grants.  My Department, in consultation with the key stakeholders, will consider all criteria regarding eligibility for maintenance grants, including the special rates of maintenance grant, in the course of the development of regulations governing a single unified grants scheme, as provided for in the Student Support Bill.</p>

         if, in respect of subhead B19 of the Revised Estimates 2008 which saw an increase from €7.394 million to €18.132 million to be distributed by the Commission on Child Abuse and its committees, largely related to legal charges, he will publish the list of legal firms, solicitors and barristers who were paid legal fees; the amount paid to each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4733">The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established under statute to investigate child abuse in institutions in the State, to enable persons who have suffered such abuse to give evidence to committees of the Commission and to prepare and publish a report of findings and recommendations considered appropriate for the alleviation of the effects of past child abuse and for the protection of children. The Commission is independent in the performance of its functions under legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4734">To date, a large number of costs insofar as they relate to representing complainants, have been settled or are currently being negotiated, with a view to settlement in the short term.  In respect of representation of respondents a large number of these legal costs remain outstanding.  These are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the solicitors acting for the respondents.</p>
            <p eId="para_4735">Accordingly, €18.132 million has been allocated to the Commission of which approximately €13 million is available to meet the negotiated settled costs during this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4736">As the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions it is a matter for the Commission to publish the details in respect of the legal fees it pays to legal firms.</p>

The main focus of the campaign was the publication and distribution of a handbook — ‘Preparing for Major Emergencies'.

            <p eId="para_4751">The Office has a number of distinct roles. These include the provision of administrative support to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and Chairing the Interdepartmental Working Group on Emergency Planning.  The Office exercises an oversight role in relation to peacetime emergency planning to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements.  It promotes the coordination of emergency planning functions across all departments and other key public authorities.  The Office also submits an Annual Report to Government on Emergency Planning.  As part of a broader public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning, approved by the Government, the Office of Emergency Planning produced the handbook ‘Preparing for Major Emergencies', which was circulated recently to every household in the country and it coordinated the accompanying media advertisement campaign.  The roles of the individual staff are assigned according to the work requirements of the Office.  The Head of the Office is responsible for overall management and policy direction and is assisted in this regard by the Deputy Head of the Office.  Other members of staff carry out research and liaise with individual departments and agencies in the emergency planning area.  They also provide support to the Government Task Force and the Inter-departmental Working Group on Emergency Planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_4755">Officials of my Department met with the residents of Orchard Park on 11th February 2008.  At that meeting issues of concern were raised by the residents and it was agreed that work was needed to be done to improve the estate.  It was requested that the residents put forward a proposal of works for the Department's consideration.  In the interim the Department provided seven large skips for the removal of the residents' refuse.  The proposal from the residents was received in the Department on 8th April 2008.  Having considered the plan, my officials met with the residents again on 16th April 2008.  At that meeting my officials outlined the generality of a programme of work that the Department is committed to carrying out.  In the short term it was agreed to provide a children's play area on an area of Curragh lands adjacent to the estate, this is to be done by means of a licence agreement.  In order to prevent unsocial behaviour it was also agreed to brick up or erect gates at laneway entrances and tarmac these laneways.  Arrangements are currently being made by my officials to facilitate progress on these issues.  The more major items of work such as provision of additional parking and the laying of tarmac on roads and footpaths will take longer to complete due to the nature and size of the job.  Since the initial meeting my officials have been in contact with Kildare County Council regarding the taking over of the estate.</p>

            <p eId="para_4793">Military medical services and facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.  The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.</p>
            <p eId="para_4794">The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the Representative Associations, is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces.  The scope of the review includes the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4795">The review has already produced a Patients Charter.  The agreement on the Patients Charter identifies the rights of members of the Defence Forces as patients and their obligations as users of the Defence Forces medical services.  It also identifies the obligations on the providers of the services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4796">The implementation of the Patients Charter is underway.  The Military Authorities have advised that the Patients Charter has been published on the Medical Corps section of the Defence Forces Intranet site.  In addition copies have been circulated, for display, to all of the Medical Aid Posts and clinics.  The Brigade Medical Officers have been directed to implement its provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4797">However, the full implementation of the Charter is clearly dependent on the resolution of the structural, resource and other challenges facing the Medical Corps.  The challenges we face with medical services in the Defence Forces go beyond the provision of the Patients Charter.  It is one item on the Medical Review agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_4798">In view of the complexity of the challenge to resolve the structural, resource and other issues facing the Medical Corps, I have decided to engage consultants to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The consultancy will deal with all relevant issues affecting the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_4799">The closing date for receipt of tenders for the provision of consultancy services was the 18 April 2008.  Tender documents are currently being evaluated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4800">The development of the capacity of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_4828">As the Deputy may be aware, certain aspects of student migration from outside the EEA have given rise to concern in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4829">It has been apparent for some time that a significant proportion of non-EEA students are in reality economic migrants who enroll in a course purely for the purpose of gaining entry to the State and accessing the labour market.  There is evidence that some students may be subject to exploitation in the workplace.  It is also believed that the concession available to students to work 20 hours per week during term time and 40 hours per week outside of that is being abused. Having regard to these factors, the Social Partners agreed under Towards 2016, "that the employment of non-EEA students is subject to an application for employment permits".  The Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment is currently developing a proposed Student Permits Scheme to give effect to this commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">A non-EEA adult student in the State is required to be economically self-sufficient. This requirement is clearly not being met in circumstances where the student is having their dependant child educated at the taxpayer's expense. Indeed it would be an untenable  proposition that a non-EEA national should be entitled, merely by dint of enrolling in one of the myriad of courses on offer, to obtain a state-funded education for their children.  An exception was made in the case of fee paying schools where, even though there is State funding, the parents also make a contribution to the costs of their child's education. However, this concession is under review at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">My Department has been carrying out a review of student immigration generally. The purpose of the review is twofold.  Firstly, it is clear that reform is needed in this area and the review will address the abuses in the system. Secondly, it will draw up proposals for a more coherent approach to student migration consistent with Ireland's general immigration policy and with the Government's other policy objectives. The review will be completed in the near future and its recommendations will be discussed at that time with other relevant Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">Ireland's image abroad is obviously something of which we must all be cognisant. That image is best served by Ireland offering a well regulated system of student migration that is aimed at attracting genuine students to bona fide educational courses.</p>

However my Department's approval was not required for the approach that was taken in the case to which the Deputy refers.

            <p eId="para_4859">The circumstances that would support such a request would be where the partners have been in a relationship for at least 4 years (i.e. evidence of a durable relationship); the immigration record of the non-EEA national; if the persons appear to have a genuine intention of residing together in the State; if the persons have an income in the State which would support them; if there is no evidence to suggest that the request for permission to remain is being used as a way of circumventing other immigration procedures.  Evidence of a civil partnership or marriage entered into in another jurisdiction, including Northern Ireland, would not of itself determine the application but could contribute to proof of a durable relationship.  The length of time to process the case will depend on the circumstances presented and the form of status sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_4860">Permission to enter and reside in the State as the partner (including same sex partner) of an EU citizen who is exercising free movement rights is covered by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No.2) Regulations 2006 (S.I.

Those regulations transposed the European Directive (2004/38/EC) on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.  The Regulations include as a  "permitted family member" a person who is "the partner with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested."   Such cases must be dealt with within 6 months of application.</p>

            <p eId="para_5106">One of the policing priorities set out under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007  is to combat, in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the available legal mechanisms, including behaviour warnings and closure orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5107">I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to the public order offences of intoxication in a public place (section 4) and disorderly conduct in a public place (section 5) as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance, are under way and that it is expected that these arrangements will be introduced in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5108">I am further informed that Operation Encounter, which was introduced in 2002, continues to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour against the community and local businesses.  The Operation specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1996 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which include the sale to and consumption of alcohol by underage persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5109">In the General Scheme of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 which was recently published, there is a proposal to empower the Garda Síochána to seize alcohol where it is in the possession of people under the age of 18 in public places.  It is also intended to provide the power to members of An Garda Síochána to seize alcohol and to move persons on where the Garda is of the opinion that consumption of that alcohol, by persons of any age, will lead to a public order offence or a breach of the public peace.  The level of all fines in the Criminal justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will also be revised upwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5110">The accelerated intake of 1,100 Garda recruits per annum is continuing and as of 31 March 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 13,900 fully attested members of An Garda Síochána with a further 1,306 recruits in training. The combined strength of the Force, including recruits in training, on that date was 15,206.</p>
            <p eId="para_5111">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking all relevant factors into account.  The situation is constantly kept under review and the allocation of Gardai throughout the country is carefully monitored by him in light of the overall policing requirements.</p>

GYDP funding covers staff, operational and programme costs; capital grants are not a feature of GYDP funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_5411">The Garda Youth Diversion Programme was placed on a statutory basis under the Children Act 2001, as amended.  This programme operates under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy will be aware that it is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force.  However I can confirm that my Department provides funding, via the Irish Youth Justice Service, to support the system of restorative cautioning under the Diversion Programme.  In 2007, funding to the amount of €150,000 was provided by my Department to fund Garda Restorative Justice Conferences across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_5414">While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I would point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest opportunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings, where appellants pursue such a course of action.  Where the latter is relevant, the time taken to discharge any proceedings is a matter for the Courts and is not something that I, as Minister, can comment on.  It is, of course, open to the applicant or the appellant to withdraw any Judicial Review proceedings which they may have instigated and this would allow for their appeal to be processed in the normal manner.  A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_5663">Since 1994, my Department has required that central heating be provided in all new local authority dwellings and the associated costs are included in the overall cost of construction projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">Under a specific programme introduced in 2004, my Department provides funding to local authorities towards the cost of installing central heating, and associated improvements in thermal insulation, in existing local authority housing.  In the 2004 to 2007 period, funding of €94 million has been provided, resulting in some 19,600 local authority homes, or two thirds of the total number estimated to be in need of central heating, benefiting from this programme.  An additional €26 million has been allocated to local authorities under the programme this year, which it is expected will result in works being carried out on more than 4,000 further homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5665">The programme includes not just central heating installation but also makes provision for measures to improve the energy efficiency of the dwellings, including attic insulation to Building Regulations standards, draught-proofing to existing windows and external doors, and the lagging of exposed pipe-work and hot water cylinders.  The type of heating system and associated improvements outlined above are a matter for determination by the relevant local authority, having regard to factors including the running costs, preference of the occupants, and the environmental benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5666">As the main intent of the programme is to replace solid fuel heating and to improve levels of thermal insulation, the overall impact of the programme will be to reduce the carbon tonnage produced.</p>

            <p eId="para_5670">Under the Waste Management Acts the relevant local authorities have the responsibility both for making statutory waste management plans and regulating the activities of persons engaged in the collection of household waste.  Furthermore, the statutory responsibility for collecting or arranging for the collection of household waste is vested in local authorities by virtue of section 33 of the Act.  As provided for in section 60(3) of the Act, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority of a statutory function given to it under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">The position in Dublin has involved the Dublin local authorities making an amendment to the regional waste management plan for which they are responsible.  Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the region, will also be using the powers available to it to review waste collection permits that it has previously issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">This matter is currently the subject of proceedings in the High Court involving a waste collection company contesting the recent actions by the Dublin local authorities in regard to waste collection and management in the region and the outcome of these proceedings is awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme and through setting of general policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">The capital programme forms part of my Department's strategy to support the fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service.  It provides funding for the construction/upgrading of fire stations, the procurement of fire appliances and specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">There have been significant improvements affecting all areas of the fire service in recent years — increased investment in infrastructure and equipment, more staff, better training, and the provision of improved communications infrastructure.  With a further investment of €26 million this year, details of which will shortly be finalised, the fire service is well positioned to meet the increasing demands placed on it in the 21st century.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">A number of priority projects have been advanced in County Waterford in recent times.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.  The provision of Exchequer funding to support further investment in the Co. Waterford fire service will have regard to the fire authority's priorities, the spread of existing facilities, and the competing demands from other fire authorities for available funding.</p>

Separately, councillors can also be reimbursed for expenses in relation to attendance at conferences and seminars as well as receiving expenses in respect of their membership of other bodies such as Vocational Education Committees, Regional Assemblies and Regional Authorities.  In addition, my Department, in consultation with the elected members associations, has promoted and supported on an ongoing basis training and development programme for councillors.</p>

It is then a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the Schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the Schemes in their area from within this allocation.</p>

         the options, in view of the recent Green Paper, available to groups seeking to establish a town council (details supplied) in order to progress matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6113">The provisions for the establishment of new town councils are contained in Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001. However, these provisions have not been commenced and in these circumstances formal moves to establish a new town council cannot proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6114">The Green Paper, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, contains a chapter on town local government which acknowledges both the positive role played by town councils and the difficulties which can confront such councils seeking to perform the complex social, environmental and infrastructural functions required of modern local government. My goal is to strike an appropriate balance between the maximisation of efficiencies and the democratic legitimacy provided by town councils; Stronger Local Democracy concludes that the establishment of new town councils would need careful consideration having regard to the potential impact on resources and efficient service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_6115">Stronger Local Democracy represents the initial phase of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process. The purpose is not to arrive at a single solution, but to present options for further consideration. It is my objective that a broad and lively debate on the future of local government will now take place. I look forward to receiving the views of all concerned, including those groups seeking to establish a town council, to help inform the preparation of the White Paper. I will give consideration to those parts of the 2001 Act which have not yet been commenced, including Part 17 of the 2001 Act, as part of the reform process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6116">Details of how to contribute to the consultation process are available on my Department's website. I also intend to hold a number of regional seminars in the coming weeks in order to gather as full a range of perspectives as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_6234">I refer to the reply to Question No. 228 of 9 April 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6235">The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating System, or BER as it is more commonly known. The BER system is being implemented under the Regulations in 4 phases:</p>
            <p eId="para_6236">BER for new dwellings was introduced with effect from 1 January 2007, with a transitional exemption applying to new dwellings for which planning permission was applied for on or before 31 December 2006, and provided they are substantially completed by 30 June 2008;</p>
            <p eId="para_6237">BER for new non-domestic buildings will commence from 1 July 2008, with a transitional exemption applying for buildings for which planning permission was applied for on or before 30 June 2008 and provided they are substantially completed by 30 June, 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_6238">BER for existing buildings of any class being offered for sale or letting will commence from 1 January, 2009; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6239">BER for all new public service buildings will come into effect from 1 July 2008, subject to the transitional arrangements applying to new non-domestic buildings, and will be applicable to existing large public service buildings from 1 January 2009.  For new public service buildings, it is proposed that the methodology for new non-domestic buildings, which I will be introducing in June 2008, will be applied and that the BER will be produced off the plans at design stage. In relation to existing public service buildings, the Regulations provide that a public body, in respect of a large building — defined as a building with a total useful floor area in excess of 1,000 metre square — occupied by it on or after 1 January, 2009, must secure and display a BER certificate.  The BER certificate must be in a prescribed form and must be displayed in a prominent place clearly visible to the public. The prescribed form will be determined in sufficient time to meet the 1 January 2009 deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_6240">It is likely that the BER certificate for display on large public service buildings will be based on operational ratings i.e. measured energy use. The purpose of the rating will be to provide information regarding the energy use of the building by the current occupant and it can also be used to show improvements over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6241">The assessment for a BER for new large public buildings or such buildings offered for sale or rent, will be carried out by a specially trained BER Assessor operating within the private sector. While trained BER Assessors will be required for the certification of new public service buildings and such buildings offered for sale or rent, final decisions remain to be taken in respect of existing public service buildings.</p>

            <p eId="para_6245">Section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 provides that the Minister may make regulations prescribing standards for houses let for rent or other valuable consideration. Minimum standards for private rented accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6246">The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) has a function of reviewing the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and of making recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments, where this is considered necessary. I am open to considering any such recommendations and am aware that the PRTB has recently identified possible amendments to the Act that may enhance the Board's operations. These amendments are being considered in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.</p>
            <p eId="para_6247">I understand that the PRTB has also considered licensing arrangements and makes no recommendations in this regard. Such issues are understood not to be the subject of a significant number of cases received by the Board. The PRTB is mindful of the need to ensure that tenancy registration requirements are not avoided through licensing and other arrangements and will continue to adopt a robust approach in dealing with any such cases arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_6282">A total of €131,500 was provided in 2007 by my Department in support of various local authority initiatives to mark mobility week.  A programme of activities was organised by both Cork City Council and Dublin City Council, including events such as walking and cycling tours, and exhibitions.

            <p eId="para_6284">I am satisfied that the funding provided in 2007 represented good value for money in terms of highlighting the principles of mobility week and car free day, not least in relation to the importance of transport in cities from both sustainable planning and climate change perspectives.  The theme for 2008 mobility week is Clean Air for All and I am currently examining how events to mark the week can be strengthened in light of the success in 2007.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_6290">The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is administered by local authorities and is part of a revised framework of grant aid, introduced in November 2007, to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs.  The Scheme, which amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE), is designed to provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.  It is targeted at older people aged over 60 years, and the maximum grant available is €10,500 which may cover up to 100% of the costs of works for applicants with gross annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.  The types of works that may be grant aided under the Scheme are varied and may include structural repairs or improvements, the provision of central heating, water and sanitary services, insulation works, contract-cleaning and painting.</p>
            <p eId="para_6291">The Scheme facilitates the implementation of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the SHAE from the Health Service Executive to my Department.  That decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the SHAE to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6292">I am conscious of the need to ensure a smooth and seamless transfer of the SHAE from the HSE to the local authority sector.  To allow sufficient time to resolve relevant issues, including the allocation of staffing and other resources, it has been agreed with the HSE that the Scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the HSE, until such time as the appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the local authorities are in a position to accept the scheme on transfer.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6293">The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  Notification of combined capital allocations for 2008 in respect of the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Schemes will shortly issue to local authorities.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme in their area, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the Scheme from within this allocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6527">I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 and 607 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6528">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 the determination of waste management charges is a matter for the relevant local authority where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_6529">Significant regulatory issues, including issues associated with waste charges and the methods for charging for service provision, have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years.  I recognise that the existing regulatory framework requires modernisation which will be taken forward in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy, provided for in the Programme for Government, which I have recently initiated.  Identification of the changes necessary will also be greatly assisted by the recently published OECD review of the public service, which includes a specific case study on waste management.</p>
            <p eId="para_6530">The revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable and affordable waste collection services and infrastructure provision, whether delivered by the private or public sectors. In these contexts the appropriate policy responses are being developed and elaborated.</p>

            <p eId="para_6532">Under the Waste Management Act, 1996 all major waste management facilities are subject to a stringent licensing system which is the statutory responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Agency's role is to ensure the application of high environmental standards with regard to the development, operation, closure and aftercare of such facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6533">While this licensing system is statutorily independent, my Department is aware that monitoring arrangements are already established within certain local authorities.  For example the Central Waste Management Facility Community Liaison Committee in Co. Clare uses the medium of Clare County Council's website to make information and minutes of relevant meetings available to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_6534">The wide ranging overall review of national waste management policy provided for in the Programme for Government is currently getting underway.  The terms of reference of the review are broad in scope; the review will examine in a comprehensive manner the various key aspects of waste management policy and will chart a way forward towards bringing Ireland to the forefront of international best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_6543">Development plans, prepared by local authorities under Part II of the Planning and Development Act 2000, provide the over-arching strategic framework for development within their areas, ensuring that all development is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.  As such, the development plan must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, which address the full range of sustainability issues such as climate change, waste management, transport, urban development, sustainable communities and the use of natural resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6544">In June 2007, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans.  The Guidelines state that it is imperative that the objectives and strategies set out in development plans are compatible with the Government's commitment to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.  Development plans should be consistent with the objectives of national initiatives that will address energy and climate change issues such as the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, which builds on the commitment to sustainable development set out in Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013.   Moreover, the conclusions in the EPA State of the Environment Report, and other evidence in relation to environmental quality and trends, should inform the drafting of development plans and be reflected, as appropriate, in their objectives and implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6545">The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out as part of the preparation and review of the development plan can help to bring environmental issues into sharper focus during the consultation phases, and should improve the overall sustainability of the plan-making process by facilitating the identification and appraisal of alternative plan strategies, by raising awareness of the environmental impacts of plans, and by encouraging the inclusion of measurable targets and indicators.  I am considering how best to ensure that the SEA process operates as an effective sustainability proofing process.</p>

            <p eId="para_6547">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998. Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.

Since its publication in February 2007, the reform agenda set out in the statement has been actively pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_6584">My Department is developing a suite of guidance documents to promote the highest possible standards in residential development and the provision of sustainable communities with access to the requisite range of public services and facilities.  In particular, in March 2007, my Department launched new design guidelines on housing delivery entitled Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities. In September 2007, new guidelines for planning authorities entitled Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments were published.  In February 2008, I published draft guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas, for public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6585">This policy guidance reinforces the Government's Developing Areas initiative which is aimed at ensuring the integrated and timely delivery of the necessary infrastructure and services in parallel with housing development: the initiative is focused on fast growing strategic locations within the National Spatial Strategy gateways and hubs, which are experiencing significant development pressures.</p>
            <p eId="para_6586">The National Development Plan provides for EU and Exchequer investment of some €170 million to facilitate the ongoing closure of the urban and village renewal measure of the Regional Operational Programmes 2000-2006, and to support the implementation of a new urban renewal programme for the period to 2013.

It is also anticipated that segregated collections will be initiated in the Clare-Kerry-Limerick region and further expanded in the south east in 2009.  Pilot schemes have also been carried out in other local authority areas, including a current pilot scheme in Louth involving 10,000 households, in preparation for more widespread provision of these services.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_6600">Ireland has long been concerned about the threat posed by the nuclear site at Sellafield.  Our concerns in relation to the site have been consistently articulated to the UK Government at political, diplomatic and official levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_6601">In 2001, in response to the imminent commissioning of the MOX plant at the site, Ireland instituted legal proceedings against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  Pending the hearing of the case, Ireland applied for and received a Provisional Measures Order, which ordered a review by Ireland and the UK of the mechanisms for inter-governmental notification and co-operation.  Arising from this, a series of co-operative measures was developed, agreed and put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6602">These measures are valuable from Ireland's viewpoint, are working well and represent considerable and real added value to the necessarily co-operative relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The Bi-Lateral Agreement on Early Notification of a Nuclear Incident, direct access to the UK Radiation Monitoring System (RIMNET), access for the Garda Siochana to Sellafield, access for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to Sellafield and other facilities, significantly improved information exchanges, co-operation on emergency planning with the UK, and improved and ongoing contacts at regulator and official level on nuclear issues, all provide objective evidence of real improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6603">The Government is continuing to pursue all political, diplomatic and where necessary and appropriate, legal options to secure the safe and orderly decommissioning of the Sellafield facility.  I consider that the ongoing discussions between the two administrations in relation to Sellafield have resulted in increased recognition by the UK Government of the depth of Ireland's concerns about Sellafield and of the priority that is accorded to the issue by the Irish Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_6604">Ireland has supported and will continue to support efforts by the European Commission to develop an increased safety role within the European Nuclear Industry.  Adoption of recent European Council Conclusions in regard to the establishment of the EU High Level Regulators Group is a significant development in the area of nuclear safety.  In Ireland's view, the transboundary risks and impacts arising from nuclear installations should be fully reflected in the instruments, structures and institutions of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_6605">The policy and actions of this Government continue to reflect the firm position that Sellafield is an unacceptable threat to Ireland and that it should be closed in a safe and orderly manner.</p>

         the progress made on the commitment given in the programme for Government to require the public sector to lead the way on energy efficiency with a mandatory programme of energy efficiency measures, including the sole use of energy-efficient lighting and heating in offices, schools hospitals and other public buildings.

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_984">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6619">My Department is currently finalising the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in light of the consultative process and I will be bringing it to Government shortly with a view to launching the Plan thereafter.  In that context I intend shortly to establish a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Working Group to drive collective delivery of the Government's target of 33% for the public sector.  The Group will bring together all Government Departments and agencies.  The involvement of the Office of Public Works and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will obviously be critical to the work of this cross Government group.  A key part of the initial work of the Group will be to quantify the extent of existing energy efficiency initiatives within public sector bodies, share experience of best practice, coordinate action and most importantly develop and implement the detailed measures for achievement of the 33% public sector target, including performance indicators.</p>
            <p eId="para_6620">It is clear that action is already being taken by a number of individual public sector bodies and much fine work is being done by OPW.  These actions are already contributing to energy savings.  The energy savings potential will vary from one public sector body to another but every public sector body will be expected to contribute significantly to meeting the Government's ambitious global target of 33%.  This will require a galvanising of all players across the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6621">My Department's national energy efficiency awareness campaign "Power of One" launched a specific module on "Power of one at work" last autumn designed to raise awareness among private and public sector employers and staff and, working with SEI, to support behavioural change and encourage investment in energy efficiency systems.  Earlier this year, OPW also launched a specific staff energy efficiency awareness campaign for 250 central Government buildings.  OPW expects this initiative to achieve 15% energy savings.  With the assistance of SEI, OPW has established an Energy Management Bureau to monitor and analyse energy use by the 150 largest central Government buildings.  It is striking that a similar initiative by third level colleges in Dublin yielded 12% energy savings for the colleges in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6622">In the context of the decentralisation programme, OPW is committed to ensuring that all new Government offices around the country are highly energy efficient.  The specification for my Department's new headquarters building in Cavan will ensure a highly energy efficient building, making full use of passive and renewable energy solutions. I have launched a major review of energy use in my Department's existing headquarters building on Adelaide Road in conjunction with OPW.  The project involves upgrading of the Building Management Systems, reducing base energy loads, installing additional energy controls, reducing energy demands in high use areas and managing seasonal solar gain in areas under significant glass cover.  OPW are also assessing as a priority the feasibility of employing passive energy solutions in the building.</p>

            <p eId="para_6625">The above regulation also provides for the establishment of Fishery District Committees, which are representative of both commercial and recreational stakeholders, with whom the Chief Executive of the Regional Fisheries Board will consult in allocating the opportunity to harvest the identified surplus in each river.</p>
            <p eId="para_6626">The combined quota that can be harvested by commercial fishing engines and recreational fishermen from the river Feale in 2008 is 4,581.  The Limerick Fishery District Committee met on 28 April 2008 to discuss the distribution of the quota and a decision will be made shortly by the CEO of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board taking account of the advice of the Committee.  One sea trout over 40 cm in length was tagged by draft net licence holders in the Feale Estuary in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_6633">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.

            <p eId="para_6634">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.

            <p eId="para_6635">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_6636">The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.

            <p eId="para_6642">The social and environmental sustainability concerns raised by the Irish Missionary Union reflect the agreed need to ensure that biofuel production and utilisation is fully sustainable.  The European Commission's Renewable Energy Directive proposes a 10% target for biofuels by 2020, backed up by proposals for stringent sustainable criteria. Together with other Member States, Ireland fully supports the sustainability imperative in relation to biofuels policy. Biofuels are a key part of the EU's strategy to reduce dependence on oil use in transport. Equally, the economic and environmental impacts of biofuels use need to be understood and addressed. We are working with the Commission and Member States in the Committee on Sustainability Criteria for Biofuels to ensure that the necessary sustainability criteria backed up by efficient administrative and reporting arrangements are put in place by the EU to underpin biofuels production and use.</p>

My consent and that of the Minister for Finance, as Shareholders in ESB, however, is required for any amendments that might be proposed to be made to the ESOP Trust Deed by the Trustees.  A number of such amendments were put forward by the Trustees last year to take account of the imminent arrival onto the ESOP internal market of a significant amount of stock from a large number of former employees of the company.  This is as a result of the requirement on all former employees to sell their stock allocations within a specified number of years after leaving the company.  It has been accepted by all parties involved that the large number of such ‘forced' sellers has potential implications for the liquidity and the effective functioning of the ESOP market.  We are working together to address those issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_6672">I am committed to ensuring that the development of the biofuels sector is fully sustainable. I will shortly be launching the public consultation on the proposed Biofuels Obligation in line with the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy Framework.  The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation by 2009 would require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  In that context, current EU policy developments in relation to ensuring the sustainability of biofuels production and utilisation will be fully factored in and publicly debated.  The recent introduction by the UK of a Biofuels Obligation will also be closely monitored for lessons to be learned in the context of finalising our own proposals. The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes, which were introduced in 2005 and 2006, enables successful project promoters to produce a certain volume of biofuels on which they are exempt from paying mineral oil tax.  The schemes have resulted in eighteen projects being awarded excise relief for the period 2005 to 2010 and are valued at over €200m.</p>
            <p eId="para_6673">My Department is also supporting research and development of Second Generation Biofuel production techniques under the Charles Parsons research awards.  Work is also under way to determine what the marine environment might contribute to developing the national biofuels capacity.  SEI in consultation with the Marine Institute is commissioning analysis of the potential of marine algae as a source of biofuels for Ireland.  This will provide a comprehensive basis on which to inform future research and development into the potential use of marine algae for renewable energy.  It will also provide data in relation to the biofuels capacity that could potentially be derived from the marine environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_6677">Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource and in this case, the issue of licences, rests with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  Licence duties are increased on an annual basis and such increases are in line with the Consumer Price Index.   Licence duties are set by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, at rates recommended by the National Fisheries Management Executive (Fisheries Boards Managers) and endorsed by the National Salmon Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6678">In 2007, as part of a suite of conservation measures for the management of the wild salmon fishery, a salmon conservation component was applied to all licences.   This component represents 50% of the licence fee and income generated from the component is dedicated by the Regional Fisheries Boards for the rehabilitation of salmon habitats and conservation measures throughout the country.   All of the proceeds of the licence fee income are reinvested, by the fisheries boards, in the conservation, protection and development of wild salmon fisheries habitat and stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6679">The Salmon Rod Ordinary Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order 2007 S.I. 794 of 2007 gives details of the current licence fees, including the conservation component, effective from 1 January 2008. The 2008 full cost of an annual salmon licence is €134; a Salmon rod (annual) district licence is €64; a Salmon rod (twenty-one day) licence is €50 and a Salmon rod (one-day) ordinary licence is €36. Further details are available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_6680">There are no plans to apply a reduced rate for anglers other than juveniles for whom a licence costs €20 per annum.   Any such reduction would require amendments to the licensing regime provided for in the primary legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6688">Better demand management, particularly at peak times, leading to reduced emissions resulting from increased energy efficiency and reductions in electricity usage,</p>
            <p eId="para_6689">The enabling of micro generation and distributed generation, as smart meters will be able to record electricity exported to the Grid,</p>
            <p eId="para_6690">Improved customer service: smart metering will allow remote meter reading allowing for more accurate billing. Smart metering technology also has the potential to enhance competition by facilitating customers wishing to switch supplier and suppliers wishing to offer innovative products.</p>
            <p eId="para_6691">A cost effective smart metering system will therefore deliver tangible benefits to all consumers of electricity.</p>

            <p eId="para_6693">Net metering, in the electricity market, requires that participating generators can access electricity meters which record both imports and exports of electricity or, at a minimum, meters which offset electricity imported by individual customers against volumes of electricity exported to the electricity system from the same property. Traditional electricity meters do not record or offset the volume of any electricity exported.</p>
            <p eId="para_6694">In line with the Programme for Government, work is underway on the roll-out of the national smart meter programme.  These meters, among other functions, can measure and record both imports and exports of electricity.  The introduction of net-metering will therefore be enabled by the national smart meter programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6698">There are a number of initiatives and schemes in the Energy Policy Framework designed to assist those on low incomes in relation to their energy expenditure.  These initiatives include:</p>
            <p eId="para_6699">The Department of Social and Family Affairs, Fuel Allowances Scheme</p>
            <p eId="para_6700">Sustainable Energy Ireland's Warmer Homes Scheme- "Keep Well This Winter, Stay Well and Warm" publication</p>
            <p eId="para_6701">Various schemes relating to local authority rented dwellings, including the Remedial Works Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6702">The Warmer Homes scheme provides insulation and other energy efficiency solutions to low income homes across Ireland.  The service is coordinated by SEI and is delivered principally through Community Based Organisations.  The scheme is targeted at householders who are in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, Disability Benefit or Invalidity Benefit and is provided either free of charge or for a nominal fee (less than €100).  Households are identified by community based installers working closely in association with other intermediaries including the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Health Services and GP networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6703">I have provided some €4 million to Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in 2008 to fund the Warmer Homes Scheme, which is an increase over the €2.5m available to this scheme in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6704">The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project is assessing the effectiveness of the interventions delivered under the current Warmer Homes Scheme in addressing fuel poverty and the final report of the Fuel Poverty Action Research Project is scheduled for publication in mid 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6705">The information pack "Keep Well This Winter, Stay Well and Warm" contains information on all national and local schemes of assistance in relation to fuel poverty.  This information pack was developed by a steering group comprising representatives from the Health Service Executive (HSE), ESB Customer Supply, SEI, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Age Action Ireland, Combat Poverty Agency and An Post.  It contains advice for householders about</p>
            <p eId="para_6706">1. Keeping well and warm;</p>
            <p eId="para_6707">2. Heating their home;</p>

            <p eId="para_6712">The pack was published during winter 2006-2007 and is available in most pharmacies, post offices, doctors' surgeries and citizens' information offices. Approximately 250,000 copies were printed and further copies are available from the ESB and the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_6713">The Energy Policy White Paper proposes that the Inter Departmental/Inter Agency Group on Fuel Poverty will be chaired by the Office of Social Inclusion and a directory of all national and local schemes of assistance in relation to fuel poverty will be published.  This Office is the Government office with overall responsibility for co-ordinating and driving the government social inclusion agenda and is based in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  My Department and the Social Inclusion Office will be liaising on the establishment of the group.  It is intended to await the outcome of the fuel poverty research project currently in progress, as set out above, before the group is established.</p>

            <p eId="para_6730">With regard to the progress made on the commitment given in the Programme for Government to empower ComReg to enforce its delivery targets, I have amended the postal regulations using powers conferred on me by the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007.  These amended regulations permit ComReg to apply to the High Court for the application of a financial penalty to An Post, as universal service provider, in the event that the company fails to comply with a direction issued by the regulator, including one in relation to quality of service targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_6731">Regarding the approval of price increases, under the existing regulatory framework ComReg must concur with price changes for services within the reserved area in advance of any such increases being applied.
