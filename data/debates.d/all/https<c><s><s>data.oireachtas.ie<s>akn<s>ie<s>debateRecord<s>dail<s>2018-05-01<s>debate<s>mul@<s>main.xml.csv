#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The Irish public, especially the women of Ireland, have been genuinely shocked at the failure to inform Vicky Phelan and many other women of the false negative screening results of smear tests which they undertook and also at the appalling manner in which Vicky Phelan was treated since. It is particularly objectionable that she was forced all the way into the High Court before settling her case. The State denied until then that a breach of duty occurred in not informing her of the false negative smear test. The State and Minister subsequently apologised after the court settlement.It is genuinely shocking that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was not informed about the case by his departmental officials until Monday, 16 April in a memo which referenced wider issues. He should publish the memo, as agreed. I am disappointed that we have not yet received it. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and I had discussions this morning with the Minister and his officials, during which it was revealed that there had been intense discussions between departmental officials and CervicalCheck about the case in advance of it being brought. However, the Minister was not told about these discussions. What was their nature and why was the Minister not brought into the loop at that point? We know that in July 2016 the former clinical director of CervicalCheck sent a letter to clinicians in which a three-point plan was outlined. The last of the points was that in cases in which a woman had died, the clinician should simply ensure the result was recorded in her notes. It was that clinically cold. One could argue that the intention of the plan - to deprive a family of such vital information - was illegal. The senior management team of CervicalCheck would have been aware of and approved the plan. The question is who else at senior level in the Health Service Executive, CervicalCheck and the Department was aware of it. The memo prepared for the Minister anticipated adverse publicity in the event that the case became public. Some of the information in it appears to be inaccurate and false, as it gives the sense that women were informed of their results. However, we now know that, contrary to the impression I got from the memo, women were not so informed. The failure of the Department and, latterly, the Minister when he was informed to anticipate the earth shattering nature of the case is very worrying. The frenzied reaction and appalling communications of the State and its services since have created genuine worry and shock across the country. It took so long to find out how many women had died. Seventeen women whose cases were reviewed have died and up to 162 were not told their results. There have been 8,000 calls to the CervicalCheck helpline. The failure to anticipate this matter in order to prepare for it and have the homework done in advance of the case becoming public is genuinely shocking and must be reflected on. Three years ago, in November 2015, it was announced that open disclosure would be legislated for in the context of the health information and patient safety Bill and that a package of measures would be brought forward by the Taoiseach in his then role as Minister for Health. The Bill has not yet been completed. This morning the Minister and his officials stated there was a culture of paternalism within the medical profession. The Bill was brought forward after the scandal surrounding the death of a baby in Portlaoise. Nearly three years later, it is extraordinary that it has not been progressed and that the open disclosure commitment made by the Taoiseach, on which he subsequently changed his mind, has not been provided for.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I say once again how saddened I was to hear about the case of Vicky Phelan and emphasise the extent to which I feel for her and her family. I am full of sorrow that she was not diagnosed sooner and wish her and her family the very best on the difficult road ahead. I pay tribute to her for her bravery, particularly in calling on women and men to go for cancer screening which we know saves lives. I am very angry on behalf of the approximately 160 women who were not told the results of the audit. Even though it would not have made a difference in their case in terms of treatment, the prognosis or outcome because they had already been diagnosed with cancer at that stage, they should have been told. It was information pertinent to their cases, lives and health which they had a right to know. I know that this controversy is having a huge impact on the women of Ireland. It is about women's health and lives and many women now feel very vulnerable and are worried. It comes after a very difficult year with controversies surrounding issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassment, difficult rape trials and other matters. This country has not always treated women very well and even today perhaps treats them very badly, as evidenced by issues such as mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries, the marriage bar and the hepatitis C scandal.That is why I am determined to get to the bottom of this matter and establish the facts. We do not yet know all the facts, and I ask people not to jump to conclusions until we do that, but we do want to establish the facts. I am determined to restore confidence in our cancer screening and I also want to ensure that this does not happen again. In terms of the actions that will now take place, there will be a statutory inquiry led by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. We believe that is the best and quickest way to do it. We need answers in months, not years, and it has the skills and the statutory powers to do so. We have also offered a repeat smear test. Any woman who is concerned about her smear test can go to her general practitioner, and if they agree an additional test is warranted, that will be done and paid for. We also plan to move to a more accurate test and will be one of the first countries in the world to do so. We are moving to a HPV-based test for cancer screening. Every patient who has been affected will be offered an individual clinical review. The approximately 160 who have not been contacted will be contacted today or tomorrow and will be offered an individual clinical review of their case. As I mentioned, we will now bring forward legislation for mandatory open disclosure to build on the legislation for voluntary open disclosure passed by the DÃ¡il only a few months ago. I have asked the Attorney General to examine if there are any outstanding cases that are similar that we may now be able to settle quickly without requiring further legal actions. To answer one of Deputy Martin's questions, the Minister was only informed of this case in the week before it was settled. He was informed that the case against the HSE was likely to be dropped or struck out, and it was. He was informed that the case against the laboratory was likely to be settled, as it was. The note reads that patients were informed and that the message had been passed on to doctors to inform their patients. We now know that was not the case in most circumstances. He was also informed that the Department did not consider this to be a patient safety incident as it fell within what they believe to be the normal error bars of screening tests. In terms of publishing the note, that note will now be published. The Minister did not want to publish the note until he had the permission of Ms Phelan to do so. He has that permission now, and if it has not been done already, it certainly will be done today.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	The Taoiseach has commented a number of times that it would have made no difference if women had been told about this in advance. He is making that comment from a clinical perspective in terms of the actual diagnosis of cancer and the response to it, but I suggest it would have made a hell of a difference to the women involved, and to their families, because in not informing the women their families were being deprived of vital information. When a family loses a mother, they lose a lot in terms of the subsequent care of children in such a family and in the duty of care to the spouse of a woman who has passed away as a result of cancer, or indeed any illness. That goes to the heart of this case, and that is why Vicky Phelan fought so hard. Families have needs. It seems to me that the fact there was a deliberate policy decision that, in the event of women having died, the information was merely to be noted on a file and the family denied that information, which is their entitlement in terms of knowing the circumstances surrounding their mother's death, is truly shocking. What is extraordinarily disconcerting is that senior people within CervicalCheck in particular approved of this policy. It seems to me that someone must have known at senior level within the HSE because the State Claims Agency does not act in isolation. It is a Government agency. It takes instructions. It is under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, yet in recent days the Government has been articulating a view that it is somewhere out there in the ether and that it does its own work independent of anybody. That cannot be true. Likewise, senior people in the Department of Health must have known because it was said to me this morning that there were intense discussions between the Department of Health and CervicalCheck.

It had to be dragged and drip-fed in a frenzied way. I have to put that to the Taoiseach.

They should have been. It was their health, their lives and their families and they had a right to know. We need to do everything we can to make sure this will never happen again. Patients should always be informed of clinical information pertinent to their case. I come from the medical profession. I am the Taoiseach, a doctor and also the brother of two sisters and know that a lot of women are afraid today. The 160 women who know that they have cervical cancer but who may not have been told about their previous false smear test result will be told this today, if they have not already been told. They will be offered an individual appointment this week in order that their clinical case can be discussed. I also know that a lot of women are very afraid today that the HSE knows that they have cancer but has not told them. That is a real concern for women, but I want them to know that that is not the case. There is nobody today with a diagnosis of cervical cancer who has not been told by the HSE. There has been a misunderstanding and I reaffirm that point very clearly. I reassure people that there is no one walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE. I also reassure women who have had smear tests. One of my girl friends with whom I spoke over the weekend was very concerned. She had a smear test in the past couple of months and is now very worried as to whether the result was accurate. I reassure women that while no screening test is 100% accurate, the tests are as accurate as they can be and pick up the vast majority of cancers.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	Today people are trying to make sense of how profoundly the State has failed the women affected by the cervical cancer scandal. A total of 208 women went for a vital screening for a life-threatening illness and were wrongly given the all clear, of whom 162 were not told about this devastating error. I understand some of them have still not been contacted, but if I have that wrong, the Taoiseach might correct it for me. Of course, for some of the women affected by the scandal there will be no telephone call, no news, no disclosure and no truth because 17 of them are dead. They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly outcomes could have been different. They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and others. They had been kept in the dark, not because of some communication error but because of a toxic culture of concealment within the HSE and a refusal to take responsibility, a culture in which women were literally allowed to die before fault was admitted. Vicky Phelan's solicitor has described what he regards as a cover-up within the HSE. The root of the scandal is found in the decision in 2008 to outsource screening. At the time the Government was told of the dangers of this move, that it would jeopardise women's' health and their lives, but it went ahead with it. Subsequently the flaws in the system were highlighted, not least by members of the quality assurance committee. Members of that committee resigned in protest because their words had fallen on deaf ears. They had fallen on the deaf ear of Mr. Tony O'Brien, formerly of CervicalCheck and now chief executive officer of the HSE. He knew this information but did nothing about it. His position is untenable and he needs to go. If he does not, the Taoiseach needs to sack him-----

Of course, we would know nothing about this scandal were it not for the bravery of Vicky Phelan which the Taoiseach has acknowledged. She is terminally ill and was coerced and harassed through the courts by the State in her fight to get to the truth.The legal strategy pursued by the State and stood over by the Government was shameful. The State bullied her and then tried to silence her. This cannot happen again to any woman or any family that takes the State to task for its failures in this scandalous episode.

The fact is that he has opposed a mandatory duty of candour. He failed to support it as Minister for Health in 2015 and he failed to support it again in February of this year when he was questioned by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly. His failure in this area reinforces the State's strategy, which is to withhold information, to dodge liability and to aggressively face down patients - women, in this instance - and their families.

Obviously, I tried to spend as much of the weekend as I had free reading up on it and trying to understand it. Even now, I do not think it is the case that anyone or everyone in this House knows all the facts. That is why it is necessary to have the statutory inquiry that has been initiated by the Minister, Deputy Harris. The decision to proceed with outsourcing to the laboratories in the US was made in 2008. The Deputy is correct when she says that Mr. Tony O'Brien was the head of the cancer screening service at the time. To this day, there are differing views on whether that was the right decision. It is important to mention some facts that might not yet be in the public domain. Approximately half of smears are read in laboratories in Ireland and approximately half are read in laboratories in the US. Three different laboratories are used - two in the US and one in the Coombe Hospital. We do not yet have any evidence that there are significant statistical differences between the numbers of false negatives emanating from each of these laboratories. If there are such differences, we need to know that is the case. We should not jump to conclusions until we know that such differences exist. Of course that will have to form part of the inquiry. Three laboratories are used. It probably makes sense for us to use different laboratories because it allows us to see if there is an outlier for some reason. We now need to examine that. I am told that the audit which was done did not show any significant statistical differences between the results of the three laboratories. I would like to speak more generally about cancer care in Ireland. I know this is about women's health and women's lives. Like everyone in the House, I am among the many people who are very worried and upset about this. I do not think we should lose sight of the wider truth that cancer care in Ireland has improved considerably in recent years. More people now survive cancer than ever before. We have better treatment, quicker diagnosis and more prevention. Cancer screening works. In 2011, the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland was 14 per 100,000. It is now ten per 100,000. Such a big decrease in a relatively short period can be attributed to things like the HPV vaccine and the screening programme. I want to encourage everyone who is offered BreastCheck, CervicalCheck or BowelScreen to go ahead and take up the appointment. These initiatives save many lives. It might be useful for me to explain briefly how population cancer screening works. Before we had screening, a person was not diagnosed with cancer until he or she had symptoms. A person went to his or her doctor if he or she was bleeding from somewhere, was jaundiced, had a lump or a bump or had lost weight. A person might have been diagnosed with cancer on foot of tests organised by his or her doctor and he or she then received treatment on that basis. Cancer screening has changed all of that. Cancer can now be detected before it is symptomatic. A key factor is that these tests are not diagnostic. It is a screening test, rather than a diagnostic test. For that reason, it is not 100% sensitive or specific. There is a margin of error. If 1,000 women are screened for cervical cancer, for example, in 980 of those 1,000 cases the woman will be given the all-clear and can be confident that she has the all-clear.In 12 of those cases, the cancer will be detected. In approximately eight from 1,000 cases, it will be missed. It is an error of approximately 0.8%. That error is not necessarily because anybody is negligent or incompetent. Even with two sets of eyes, or four eyes, looking at every film, there is an error rate of 0.8%. We need to explain that and try to get that message across. I want to encourage people to go for those smear tests, to have that BreastCheck and send back the colorectal screening. These tests are not 100% but they pick up many cancers early. By picking up those cancers early, people's lives are saved. Whatever we do in this House over the next couple of weeks, let us make sure that message keeps coming through.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	Do not underestimate the level of public understanding of the importance of screening. Women know full well that cervical screening and BreastCheck are essential parts of their healthcare. That is not a matter of public debate. We also know they are not diagnostic and there is no "100%". Furthermore, we know that in these cases, information was deliberately withheld from women and their families. That is the issue. The Taoiseach tells us the first he heard of all this was on Thursday or Friday last week. I presume he is referring specifically to Ms Phelan's case. The Taoiseach was the Minister for Health in 2014. Is he saying he knew nothing about the audit or the review of the CervicalCheck scheme at the time as Minister for Health? What was his state of knowledge at that point in terms of the screening approach and, more particularly, the initiation of this audit and its findings? The Taoiseach did not answer my question on the matter of a mandatory duty of candour. I find that very surprising as he went to some lengths to say that women and patients have a right to full information. Will the Taoiseach clarify the position? In the past the Government blocked a mandatory duty of candour and I want to hear that the Taoiseach will now support it as Head of Government. Will the Taoiseach also answer my question on Mr. Tony O'Brien, head of the Health Service Executive? Does the Taoiseach have confidence in him, because I certainly do not? Will he do what is glaringly apparent and relieve Mr. O'Brien of his duties?

It is a custom and practice.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	I appreciate that. The basis on which the Deputy has called for the dismissal of Mr. Tony O'Brien is an assertion that the decision to outsource these tests to the US in 2008 somehow cost lives. I explained why that is not yet supported by the facts. Everyone, even Mr. Tony O'Brien, deserves a fair hearing before being condemned. We need to assess whether that decision was wrong. It may turn out not to be wrong. We need to be fair about it in that regard. The Deputy asked about my state of knowledge on various occasions during my two years as Minister for Health. I was informed of major patient safety incidents and I was certainly informed of matters in Portlaoise, for example, as well as concerns with bowel screening in the south east. All those matters are in the public domain. I was never informed of any patient safety concern or potential scandal relating to CervicalCheck and certainly not the outcome of any audit such as this. I have asked officials in the Department to check that for me in case my recollection is incorrect. With respect to open disclosure and the duty of candour, I point out once again that both open disclosure and duty of candour form part of the Medical Council's ethical guidelines for doctors.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	22	That is not what I asked.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	These are not optional and one may be struck off for not following them. Open disclosure has been policy for all HSE staff since 2013. The Deputy is incorrect in that we commit to two actions in the programme for Government. The first is to legislate for voluntary open disclosure in all cases and the second is to legislate for mandatory open disclosure in cases of a serious reportable event. We did the first one in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which supports voluntary open disclosure and puts it on a statutory footing. The legislation was passed last year in this House and it will be commenced in the coming months. We will do the second action in the patient safety Bill, as the Minister committed to last year and we committed to in the programme for Government. That action is to legislate for mandatory disclosure in those serious incidents.Turning to my own role - I do want to answer this - I did make a decision to make a voluntary open disclosure before a mandatory open disclosure. I made that decision having taken advice from the Chief Medical Officer and my Department which had listened to all stakeholders and heard their views. The all-party committee also considered this matter last year and recommended that approach in its published report - going for voluntary open disclosure first and then mandatory open disclosure. There was a DÃ¡il vote on the matter.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	24	Across Ireland today there are many thousands of women who are terrified following the revelations about the CervicalCheck screening programme. Following an audit of women diagnosed with cervical cancer, we know that 208 women should have been told and had earlier interventions. It beggars belief that 162 of these women were not told, and, from what has been said today, may not yet have been told about the outcome of the audit process. Of the 162, we now know that 17 have died. The only audit carried out was of those who had developed cancer. Is it true that no other smear test result has been rechecked? Women and their families need reassurance that their health will be our paramount consideration in the days ahead and that they will receive the best advice, the best healthcare and the best support possible. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, established a helpline. However, it is not clear who should be ringing it. Has a particular group of women been identified? Is there a concern about a particular age cohort, region of the country or date on which the tests were taken? There is not so far an identifiable cohort of women that the HSE believes is at risk; therefore, all women who have been tested are anxious and all are suspicious about their test results.  The first port of call for any woman concerned is likely to be her own general practitioner, GP. As far as we know, no guidelines have been provided for GPs on how to deal with the concerned calls they are receiving. The Government's first duty was to reassure women and put all of the necessary supports and guidances in place. Will all women be retested? That is the logical next step in providing reassurance, but is it a practical proposition?  The Taoiseach also announced yesterday that a statutory inquiry would be established through the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. When HIQA carries out an inquiry, it is based on examining the systems and processes in place in a particular health facility. It was not set up under the Act to carry out a fact-finding inquiry to answer all of the questions that arise in this matter. It also cannot cross-examine witnesses under oath and I am advised that it is highly unlikely that it will be able to make findings of contested fact against any individual. The Department of Health, of course, does not come within HIQA's statutory remit. For these reasons, I ask the Taoiseach to think again. Will the Government establish a proper inquiry to investigate what happened? A commission of investigation is obviously required. Will the Taoiseach begin the drafting of terms of reference for a commission of inquiry and begin today to consult all interested parties?

A clinical audit is a normal part of medical practice. Any doctor who wants to stay on the medical register has to be involved in a clinical audit; therefore, on any given day there are hundreds or perhaps even thousands of audits being carried out across the health service. There may well have been other audits carried out of cervical checks.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	26	The Taoiseach does not know.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	27	I do not, but my assumption is that other audits have been carried out. It is part of normal healthcare practice that clinical audits are carried out. Practice is checked and rechecked each cycle to see what can be learned. There are different audits that can be carried out. For those women who are concerned, the helpline is open to any of them who wants to make a call and seek information. I thank the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association Of General Practitioners for their co-operation. The Minister has been in touch with them.If a woman is concerned, she can go to her general practitioner. If it is appropriate and they decide that a repeat smear test should be done, it can be done and we will meet the cost of that. Again, I want to reassure the women of Ireland that our screening service is safe. It is not 100%, although no screening service is because there are false negatives. If a woman goes for screening there is a very good chance that, if she has cancer, the cancer will be diagnosed early and, as a result, she will get early treatment and a far better outcome and prognosis. Again, I want to pay tribute to Vicky Phelan for putting that message across. Despite what has happened to her she is sending out the message clearly that people should continue to attend for their smears, breast checks and that the same should apply to men and women for colorectal screening. I was asked about the Health Information and Quality Authority inquiry. The Department of Health will, on a voluntary basis, agree to be covered by that. It is not in legislation but the Department has agreed to do that and arrangements will be made to do exactly that. HIQA is the body that has powers. It is the body that has done investigations into the health service before in Portlaoise, for example, and in respect of a death in Tallaght Hospital. HIQA has the expertise, knowledge and the statutory power of compellability. I appreciate the Deputy's suggestion that a commission of inquiry might be an alternative and I cannot rule out that being necessary in the future. However, I would point out that commissions of inquiry take a long time. It is three years, for example, since the commission of inquiry on the Grace case was announced. The Siteserv inquiry could go on for many years. One thing Vicky Phelan has said, and I think she is right, is that she does not want an inquiry that goes on for years. A report could be received by a future Government perhaps. What we want is an inquiry that gives us answers quickly. The risk with a commission of inquiry, of course, is that everyone goes legal and lawyers up and it takes years before we get a report, with probably no answers at the end of that. That is why I am calling for the co-operation of the House in supporting the HIQA inquiry, which we believe will get answers quickly, and, if not, then we will consider a commission.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	28	I have a second question. I have re-read the Act that established HIQA. It is very constraining in terms of what the authority can do. It refers to how HIQA must ensure that an investigation does not interfere or conflict with the functions of any other statutory body. HIQA can appoint an approved person with the approval of the Minister. It has limited power to demand production of relevant documentation. It has no power to direct the attendance of a witness, to direct a witness to answer questions or to demand or receive sworn evidence. Witnesses are not given any immunity in respect of the evidence they give. In the absence of any provisions, it is unlikely - I am advised legally - that the authority can come to any adverse findings against named individuals that might be contested. That is not appropriate to address the degree of issues that are rocking the country right now and I call on the Taoiseach to think again on that. The first priority is to provide reassurance to women today. In truth, the only rechecked smear tests that we know about - the Taoiseach may say there are others - are for the 208 women who got cancer subsequently. They have been rechecked. I would love to hear some reassurance on that point. In the case of all the other smear tests, has there been a systematic recheck? Can the Taoiseach give reassurance to women who are looking in that their smear tests have been rechecked too and that there is no concern? The Taoiseach says that any woman who has a concern can have another test. Is it possible to have rechecks for the thousands of women who may want that now? Is that a practical proposition? How should they go about it?

Since 2008, 3 million smear tests have been carried out by CervicalCheck. I do not believe it would be practical to repeat 3 million tests or recheck them and that may well not be warranted.The HSE has advised, however, that between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases had been notified to CervicalCheck by the national cancer registry. The majority of those cases were patients who had already been referred for further clinical investigation or treatment by CervicalCheck. As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and 277 cases were flagged for further cytology review. In 208 of those cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original test and what I understand has been done with all of these smear tests is that every single one of them - all 3 million - have already been looked at by two people, by two sets of eyes. There is a quality control process as well that does a cycle of rechecks to make sure that the laboratory is up to standard. As I explained, there is an error rate and that error rate, as we know so far, is no greater in this particular laboratory. That is something we need to check.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	33	This scandal is and will go down in this State's history as one of the worst instances of serious medical neglect, particularly of women, along with the ingrained culture in the health service to deny and cover up this scandal. The response of the health service to the hepatitis C scandal, the deaths of babies in Portlaoise hospital, the cases of national maternal deaths and catastrophic injuries, symphysiotomy etc. has been to admit nothing and make patients jump through emotional and financial hoops to prove their case. That has been the history of this State. The HSE eventually came out yesterday and confirmed at least 208 women, who have since been diagnosed with cervical cancer, were initially told their tests were negative, and of those, 17 women have died. In 173 cases women would have been given a different clinical treatment if earlier smears had been read correctly and 162 of the 208 were not told a review had been conducted by CervicalCheck or of the outcome. Cian O'Carroll, the solicitor acting for Vicky Phelan, for whom I have huge respect and admiration - we should be not only angry but livid about what is after happening in these cases - believes all 1,482 cases should be subjected to independent review. Could this situation have been prevented? In 2008, the then Fianna FÃ¡il-Progressive Democrats Government made a political decision to outsource our smear testing to private companies overseas. Why? It was because they made a political decision not to resource the services here. Sam Coulter-Smith, a former master of the Rotunda Hospital, said he warned the Government a decade ago against testing being moved to private companies overseas because he was worried that resulting problems would mean cancer cases being missed. He said: "Our cytology system in the Rotunda Hospital, which was well developed, fully accredited and world class, with very good quality assurance systems in place and numerous people analysing smears - two looks rather than one - the quality assurance was at a much higher level than the US." Dr. David Gibbons, who was chair of the cytology-histology group within the national cervical screening programme, with a number of his peers, has stated that they raised with the then CEO of the National Cancer Screening Service, Tony O'Brien, their serious concerns. He said he warned Tony O'Brien when he saw the figures from the United States were showing one third fewer high grade dysplasias compared with Ireland. It was 1.8 in Ireland and 1.2 in the US. He was concerned about a mismatch of systems. Ireland tests for cervical cancer every three years where the US system would test annually. He predicted in 2008 that up to 1,000 women per year would be affected and that this would become apparent ten to 15 years down the line. That has happened. It is a reality for the women affected by these reviews and it must be seriously taken on board. Somebody has to be answerable for this. People in this country are sick and tired of these cases. In the hepatitis C case the CEO walked away with a gold-plated pension and people like Brigid McCole had to go to the courts to fight their cases. I reiterate the call from the Sinn FÃ©in Deputy that Tony O'Brien or somebody should be held to account. The political system should be held to account for this as well. An international peer review is being done on the screening. The Taoiseach said approximately half are done in the United States or outside the country and the other half are done here. We should have a clinical assessment of the exact number that came from the US and from here.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	46	To clarify, in all 1,400 cases the original smears have been rechecked. The way the audit worked is that if a woman was diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2008 and 2014, they went back and checked all of the smear tests to see if there were false negatives or false positives. To reassure people, in all 1,400 cases those smear tests were rechecked already. That is the way this audit cycle works. In relation to the laboratories, I hope I answered already - if I did not I am happy to repeat it or clarify - that we are moving towards a new more accurate test. No test is 100% accurate. There will still be false positives and false negatives, but we are moving to a new test which is a HPV-based test for cervical cancer screening. That new test will come in later in the year. That offers us an opportunity to reconfigure the laboratories and review which laboratories we use. Whatever we do, it should be based on facts. We are letting women down and letting people's health down, in particular women's health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts. As I explained earlier, 50% of smears are checked in cytology laboratories here in Ireland and 50% are outsourced. Three different laboratories are used - two in the United States and one in Ireland - and so far there is no evidence that any of those laboratories is less accurate than the others in terms of false negatives in a statistically significant way. Whatever we do, it must be based on facts. We should not merely sack somebody or change the laboratories for some reason. In the interests of women and their health and doing what is right, we must base our decisions entirely on facts and evidence. In terms of resignations, it is worth noting that the head of the programme, its clinical director, Professor GrÃ¡inne Flannelly, has already stepped down. We accept that she has made that decision, taking accountability for the appalling communication failures that occurred. However, it is also important to note that she is somebody who was involved in bringing in this programme over the years and, as a consequence, helped not only to save many women's lives but also to ensure many women had much less invasive operations because their cancers were picked up earlier. We should be balanced in our response and recognition of that. On the duty of candour issue, as I said, duty of candour is already in the medical council guidelines. On the decision taken last November on mandatory open disclosure, this commitment was given to Deputy Clare Daly, who brought the amendment forward and made some good points in that debate in the DÃ¡il, by the Minister both verbally and in writing that on foot of the legislation for voluntary open disclosure, which was passed by these Houses a few months ago, he would bring forward mandatory open disclosure in line with the programme for Government in cases where it is a serious reportable incident or error. The Minister is developing that legislation. It will be in the patient safety Bill. The Minister expects to bring a memorandum to Cabinet next week and we will get that legislation done as soon as possible. If people think that merely changing the law or guidelines will resolve this problem once and for all, it will not. What is required is a change of culture in our healthcare. We need to move towards a culture of truth and that is something I would like to speak about later.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	47	I honestly believe this is not merely a communication failure. It is a service and resource failure. Mr. Tony O'Brien, in 2008, stated, "At the time there was not sufficient capacity of that type in Ireland." It was not resourced and they had to go abroad to private companies overseas. That is a fundamental issue in our screening. I would like to get the facts. The Taoiseach correctly states we should get the facts.The fact of the matter is we have women dying here because their screening was not tested adequately. They were screened in 2011, their smears came back negative and they were retested. That is the information I read and which the Taoiseach said he read over the weekend. If corners are cut it does not work. More often than not, in the longer term one pays more both financially and in terms of the human cost. At this point we should be looking at bringing all our screening back. Even if we bring in new HPV screening, it still has to be checked to World Health Organization standards. We should be looking at that now rather than waiting for reviews and peer reviews. I would like the Taoiseach to come back on that. Sam Coulter-Smith has said that very clearly.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	48	I am still trying to figure out all the facts. I appreciate the Deputy's sentiment that decisions we make on this should be based on facts. We are really letting people down, particularly the women of Ireland, with regard to women's health if we make decisions that are not based on fact. We do not yet have all the facts. That is why we need to have the HIQA inquiry. That is why we need a little bit more time to get to the bottom of this. I want to get to the bottom of this. I want to know all the facts. I want to make sure we can restore confidence in our cancer screening service. If one takes the entire audit, which I think included 1,400 cases in total, there were 208 false negatives. That is 208 people who had smear tests that were reported as normal but who then went on to develop cancer. We cannot say how many of those were false negatives yet within the margin of error. We cannot say for certain. Very sadly, those 208 people have cancer. Some of them are very sick and 17 have passed away, very sadly. We cannot say with certainty that had there been a different test done in a different lab that those cancers would have been picked up. I see from one of the notes today that a slide was looked at by eight specialists - eight cytologists. They are scientists who are experts in this field. Eight of them were asked to look at a sample. They were told the woman had been diagnosed with cancer; five of the eight could not see the cancer cells and three could. These tests are not 100% accurate. They are subjective. There is a degree of margin of error. We will do our best over the coming period to try to explain.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	100	In a major announcement in November 2015 in response to a range of issues about patient safety the Taoiseach said the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill 2015 would make mandatory the reporting of events which had resulted in death or serious harm. At the time the heads of the Bill had been published but in May 2018 the Bill remains in Schedule B. It has been around for a long time. In 2015 it was specifically stated mandatory reporting of events which had resulted in deaths or serious harm would be introduced. A year later this was changed at the request of the Chief Medical Officer. This happened around the time of the Portlaoise scandal. Will the Taoiseach explain why it is taking so long for the legislation to be enacted? He will be aware of the scandal in Portlaoise which, as I understand it, provoked the major announcement of this legislation and a suite of other measures, but there is no sign of it being placed in the Statute Books any time soon. Will the Taoiseach explain the reason for the delay? It is does not speak well of the legislative process or this House that a Bill of this import takes so long to enact.

There are two reasons for the delay. First, the legislation, as I announced it in 2015, was to be the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill. To fast-track the mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable events, the Bill is to be split. The patient safety aspect is to be withdrawn in order that the Bill can be fast-tracked. The Minister will bring forth a memo in that regard in the next week or two. Second, as I announced at the time, it was part of a programme of reform in the civil legal system and of patient safety law. It is important to acknowledge what has been done. It is not the case that nothing was done in the two-year period.

To move away from a system of awards of â¬15 million and â¬20 million, we now have periodic payment orders which allow payments to be made over a period of time and which can be reviewed as a patient's case changes.That legislation was passed also. We also passed the Legal Services Regulation Act, which brings in pre-action protocols. The point of pre-action protocols is to speed up cases and make sure people do not get stuck in the courts for years. We also enacted the Mediation Act because we would prefer if matters such as this could be dealt with by mediation rather than going to trial at all. This is all part of a programme of reforms that have been waiting for a long time to get done. Many of these were done in the past two years and this is the next one.

In 2015 the Government pulled the plug on mandatory open disclosure as a statutory duty of candour. The Taoiseach was on the record that he thought it was a good idea, but on the basis of information or advice, he backed away from it. That was a mistake but that is what he did. The Taoiseach now tells us that the health information and patient safety Bill, which is on the B list, is being fast-tracked. Is there not a contradiction inherent in this? It sounds to me that the Taoiseach was not keen on this proposition and he is now moving under pressure. I welcome the fact he is moving on the matter but I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House, not in some vague way, exactly when we will see this legislation. Do not pretend this was something on the to-do list when clearly the Taoiseach had wrongly backed away from it. That was a mistake. Now, because of this appalling turn of events, it is back on the Government's agenda. This is the correct thing to do. There should not have been a delay but we are where we are. Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain how something that is being fast-tracked could be on a B list. This does not make any sense to me. Is the Taoiseach moving it on to an A list or is there some kind of supercharged approach to this now? It needs to happen quickly. It is part of the public confidence thing the Taoiseach is keen on.

I obviously did not but I will try again to explain the situation as I did earlier. A decision was taken in 2015 as part of a package of patient safety measures I announced, many of which have now happened. I have listed some of the measures that happened over the past two years. A lot has been done. At the time it was my intention to do mandatory open disclosure at the same time as voluntary open disclosure. Having taken advice from the Chief Medical Officer and from my officials, who had consulted with stakeholders, a decision was taken to do voluntary open disclosure first and mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable incidents at a later date. That is in the programme for Government. We put this into the programme for Government and it has been in the programme for two years. As I mentioned earlier, the Joint Committee on Health examined this matter only in the last year. It listened to all the stakeholders and considered the matter. This all-party Joint Committee on Health also recommended that we should do voluntary open disclosure first and then mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events at a later date. This is what we are doing.

On International Workers' Day, I want to raise the issue of the promise in the programme for Government to tackle the gender pay gap. As we once again sadly debate Ireland's failure on women's health, will the Taoiseach advise the House on when the Government plans to progress its own legislation or accept and amend the Labour Party's Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017, which is in the Seanad? That Bill has passed Committee Stage in Seanad Ãireann and is ready to move on to Report Stage. It could readily be enacted. There is no reason the Government cannot introduce its own amendments if it wants to improve the Bill. It really is time that we tackled the issue of the gap in pay between men and women. This would be a good day to signal the Government's intent in that regard.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	113	Last year, when it emerged that the new national maternity hospital would be under the ownership of the Religious Sisters of Charity, there was outrage. The guidelines of this organisation state that the morning-after pill, IVF, vasectomy, sterilisation of women and abortion should be forbidden in their hospitals. There were demonstrations. Dr. Peter Boylan resigned from the board and more than 100,000 signed a petition to demand that the hospital be under exclusive public ownership. Following those protests, the Religious Sisters of Charity said they would not be involved in the ownership of the hospital. An article in The Sunday Times by Justine McCarthy, however, says that the National Maternity Hospital will be obliged to uphold the "values and vision" of the founder of the Religious Sisters of Charity, which is against the wishes of all of those who protested, who I think represent a majority of society. Will the Taoiseach or the Minister, who is not here, clarify whether that is the case? Do they agree that the church and religious orders should play no role in the operation of public hospitals? Do they agree that it points to the need for a separation of church and State?

I presume the Taoiseach is wearing his red socks in recognition of it. Workers today are still struggling to get decent pay and conditions. A recent report by Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, shows increasing growth in precarious employment. Precarious employment does not just condemn workers to low pay, which now affects one in four workers according to the criteria of the OECD. Precarious work also affects access to health services, housing and other services. When will the Government's Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, even though the union Mandate says it contains shortcomings, be presented to the DÃ¡il?

Will the Taoiseach encourage - he is very good at this no matter what colour socks he wears or what he tweets on his social media accounts - all parents and indeed anyone who may suspect that they have the condition to take immediate steps to obtain potentially life-saving information from organisations such as the Asthma Society of Ireland, the HSE, or anyone else?

Almost 90%, the vast majority, of the State claims and compensation are in this area of health and childcare, through Tusla and the HSE. Does the Government have any plans to move to a legislative process which would have a no-fault medical liability system similar to what there is in New Zealand, Sweden and other countries so that we would not have to pay the legal costs and our patients would not have to go through the gruelling legal system which they are put through to prove cases of malpractice? Does the Government have any intention to move towards that system of covering for cases of malpractice rather than the gruelling and expensive legal system we use?

Even community banking and handling car tax were proposed as major steps to save our post offices. More than two years later, in excess of 390 rural post offices throughout the country received letters from An Post, telling them that a drop in their income will be going ahead due to the sorting of mail and other things being taken from them. They were then offered a package to get out. One of these, among others, in west Cork, was the post office in Ballydehob, which, I may add, is one of the busiest post offices in west Cork due to the hard-working Bridie, the postmistress.

Over recent days, I have heard crocodile tears coming from Government Deputies going to these postmasters and postmistresses when these same Deputies have failed to implement the programme for Government. Will the Taoiseach stand idly by and watch these post offices close? Will he give a date for when the post offices will become a one-stop shop for Government services as promised in the programme for Government?

Young people's lives are being torn apart because of Lyme disease. The Taoiseach knows, as a doctor, the symptoms, pain and suffering that it is causing.

The Minister said that there would be no delays in delivering these schools. One in my constituency, ColÃ¡iste RÃ¡ithÃ­n, is complete and ready for occupation. The only thing holding it back is red tape. We were told that we had to go through a new tendering process. We were supposed to have a decision on that on the 28th of last month.

The previous Government also promised guidelines in this area. Four Ministers later, we still have not received them. We must have good planning and get communities on board. The problem is that wind farms are springing up apace in the meantime. The most recent one to be granted planning permission comprises 12 giant turbines in Walsh Island on the far side of Portarlington, County Offaly. The turbines are probably well in excess of 500 m in height and within 700 m of homes. The Government has proposed draft guidelines but we have not yet seen proper guidelines to regulate these wind farms. It is an urgent issue which every recent Government has danced around. It is time for that dancing to stop. Communities in Laois and Offaly need protection.

Juvenile arthritis is a serious problem in this country, as the Taoiseach is aware. Up to 1,500 young people suffer from it. The World Health Organization recommends six rheumatologists for a population the size of Ireland's. We only have two. It has also stated that the waiting period should be no more than six weeks. In Ireland, it is three years. Although there is no specific commitment to junior arthritis in the programme for Government, I ask the Taoiseach to give a commitment to deal with that issue as the financial aspect of the health budget improves, as hoped, because it causes much distress and harm to young persons.

That will be considered for the service plan 2019.

I am satisfied that the data protection measures in place in my Department are robust. There are secure policies and procedures in place for paper files and electronic data. All information and communication technology, ICT, systems operated within my Department are securely managed. Access to the systems is controlled through a variety of security measures, including industry-leading technologies which are regularly updated. My Departmentâs electronic records and files are held on a secure internal network. The network is connected to the Internet through the Government networks service, which is a private, managed, wide-area network connecting public service bodies on a data, voice and video-capable network. The general data protection regulation, GDPR, comes into force on 25 May. The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for transposing into Irish law those parts of the regulation for which member states have competence. The enacting legislation in Ireland, the Data Protection Bill, is starting Committee Stage in this House today. It is the Governmentâs intention to have the Bill enacted ahead of the 25 May deadline and I ask for support from all sides of the Oireachtas to ensure we meet that target. An important priority for the Government has been to ensure that Irish organisations are ready for the GDPR when it comes into force. In addition to the awareness campaign of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection, Deputy Pat Breen, has been involved in a range of activities to promote awareness and regularly meets business groups and representative bodies to ensure everyone is aware of their privacy rights and obligations under GDPR. This work will continue after 25 May. As regards my Department's preparations for GDPR, a data protection officer, DPO, has been appointed and has been meeting the various divisions in the Department, which are reviewing what personal data they receive, how they manage it and any scope for improvement.A number of staff, including the DPO, have already attended training sessions on the GDPR and further training will be provided. Separate from the data protection officer, the data protection unit, DPU, which is within the economic division of my Department supports the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection and contributes to a whole-of-Government approach to the challenges arising from the increasing digitisation of modern life in association with significant increases in the amount of personal data generated. The data protection unit also acts as the secretariat to the interdepartmental committee on data issues which was established in 2015 to bring a whole-of-Government perspective to data issues. While compliance with the GDPR is a matter for each individual organisation, the committee has helped to raise awareness of the GDPR across the public service and received regular briefings from the Department of Justice and Equality on the legislation.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	190	The GDPR will ensure a harmonised system of data protection rules that will work across the European Union. My understanding is the Bill will be before the committee tomorrow and I hope it will pass all Stages by 25 May. It is unfortunate that we are so late in the day, given the fact that companies and others are preparing for the introduction of the legislation. We welcome the strengthening of protection for citizens. Such protection of citizens' privacy rights is more important now than ever, particularly given the presence of such global technology giants as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and many others. On the information published on Facebook scraping, impacting on more than 50 million members of the public, belatedly, policies are being introduced by companies to seek the user's permission to use his or her data for other companies. The case with Atlantico also involved an appalling abuse of personal data. RTÃ had to issue a statement yesterday on a fake report on Facebook mimicking RTÃ. There are serious issues and the Bill will help to deal with some of them, although I point out that some public representatives are concerned that the impact of the Bill on their unique role in interacting with citizens might render it impossible. The Minister should look at that aspect before the Bill is completed. I also raise the issue of the digital age of consent. This is more about companies using the data of young people for their own purposes in marketing and so on. There is a very strong case for reviewing it and allowing the digital age of consent move to 16 years if, for nothing else, to create pressure on companies to carry out their duties and responsibilities to children and young people. The area of privacy and data protection has come to light in the context of the Independent News & Media, INM, story in terms of the breach of data protection that is the subject of an affidavit in the High Court but also an investigation by the data protection officer. I am conscious that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Murray, produced a significant report on the protection of sources, including journalistic sources. He produced a more broad-based report on the digital age of consent and protecting privacy all round from the State and recommened that such protections apply in the private sector also. It is essential that, as a country, we move fairly quickly on these matters.

Will the Government give further consideration to the appropriate digital age of consent because the protection of young people is more frequently in the minds of all citizens when we see to what young people are being required to sign up? Children younger than 16 years should be protected from this. The Taoiseach told the DÃ¡il that the Government was considering legislation to protect journalists' sources following the alleged data breach at INM. He may recall that on Tuesday he said it was time for the Government to dust down reports on the issue. Has that dusting down been completed and is there a commitment to legislate in this area? We all agree that the protection of journalistic sources and a free press from interference is an important bulwark of our democracy. It is a concern for all of us that there would be a doubt about who might access journalists' sources and certainly the activities of a free press. Last week I looked at the ranking of Ireland in terms of journalistic freedom and it is reasonably high. We have to make sure we maintain and improve that status by having protections for journalists.

I echo what he said. I know that it is a concern, certainly among members of my parliamentary party and the Cabinet, that we should not bring forward data protection laws that would restrict Deputies and Senators in doing the work they have been doing for years and decades in serving their constituents. When this issue was discussed by the Cabinet, as part of its decision, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General were mandated to examine the unique role of the Oireachtas Member to see if any exemption or exception might be appropriate when it came to communications between Oireachtas Members and their constituents or about Oireachtas Members and their constituents. At the same time, however, we need to be mindful of the fact that, as legislators, we probably should not impose laws on others that we are not willing to impose on ourselves. That is something we have to bear in mind, but it is part of the ongoing considerations. On the Murray report and protecting journalists' sources, I did dust it down and look at it. It is still under consideration as to whether we can legislate to protect journalists' sources. We have identified three complications and certainly would welcome the advice of Deputies in other parties on how we might overcome them. The first is the definition of a "journalist". Journalism is an unregulated profession. We know what a doctor is because to protect the title one is registered with the Medical Council. We know what a nurse is because it is a protected title and one is registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board. We know that also to be the case for physiotherapists and teachers. A huge number of professions are regulated. One cannot just call oneself a teacher or an architect. They are regulated professions. One must register with a professional body and uphold a certain code of conduct and there is a mechanism by which one could be struck off the register. Journalism is not in that space. It is an unregulated profession. I know that there is a press council, but journalists are not regulated in the way other professions are. One does not have to register; one cannot be struck off and there is no fitness to practise body, which creates a complication. It is difficult in law, therefore, to define what a journalist is. Particularly in the current era when there is a huge amount of social media, there is the emergence of the citizen journalist who is somebody who may have another job, be self-employed or have a business but who may also be a journalist on occasion, perhaps for an hour a day or whenever he or she likes to be a journalist. We would need some way to define what a journalist is before we could protect their sources. That is a complicated task when it is not a regulated profession in the way other professions are regulated. It is not a protected title in the way other titles are protected. There is a second reason we would not protect sources for other people. As politicians, we are often given confidential information by people. I am sure people in other walks of life are also given confidential information. Would we apply it more widely? I imagine some of it is covered by DÃ¡il privilege, but it may not all be covered. There may be other professions for which we could also consider this. We would also have to consider exceptions. For example, there is legal privilege whereby lawyers have protections. Doctors, for example, are protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, but in no cases are these protections absolute.If the High Court orders a doctor to breach patient confidentiality, he or she must do so. There are certain conditions under which doctors are expected to breach doctor-patient confidentiality, for example, if a patient poses a danger to other people. Again, we would have to consider under what exceptions journalists could be required to give up their sources. Would it be following a ruling of the High Court, for example? All those things have to be thought through. I have not thought them through yet or determined the right answers and certainly we would welcome the advice and views of other parties in that regard. The Government made a decision last year to accept 13 as the age of digital consent, based on recommendations made by organisations and individuals that work with children who are best able to advise us on the balance of autonomy versus safety. Advice was sought from the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children as well as Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur for children. They all recommended that we opt for 13 rather than 16. I understand that some parties have reconsidered and changed their position of late. Of course, people are entitled to do that. I will not criticise anyone for changing his or her view because we all do that on occasion, as facts and contexts change. I assume that this will go to a vote at some point over the next period.

The division supports me in my international role including as a member of the European Council and in my other EU and international engagements. The division also provides advice and support to me on Northern Ireland affairs, British-Irish relations and on Brexit. The division provides advice, briefing and support in respect of my varied international engagements, including meetings of the European Council and other EU summits, bilateral engagements with Heads of Government of EU member states and other countries and in respect of international affairs more generally. The division also supports the work of Cabinet committee C which deals with EU affairs and Brexit and works closely with other relevant Departments, most particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

I welcome the visit to Ireland by Mr. Michel Barnier. Yesterday's all-island civic dialogue on Brexit in Dundalk was a very good initiative which was particularly enjoyed by the young people who were invited to participate. Mr. Barnier is also due to visit Newry, Derry and Dungannon and it is very important that he makes those trips. I was pleased to see that the Taoiseach visited Warrenpoint and Lurgan. Those visits were also extremely important and I am sure the Taoiseach did not miss how warmly he was welcomed by all sections of the community. In that context, the obnoxious, racially charged and very discourteous remarks made by a person formerly known as Mr. John Taylor, now known as Lord Kilclooney, are to be absolutely rejected. In my experience, such remarks do not represent the attitude of the vast majority of people from any side of the community, where people carry themselves with considerably more dignity and courtesy than that. I was interested to hear Mr. Barnier's comments in respect of the Border, the backstop and the answer to the Irish question. I also listened very carefully to what the Taoiseach and the TÃ¡naiste had to say. I want to reiterate that I am very concerned that these matters have slipped from December to March and now on into June. We are being told that June, rather than being a red line or a definitive date, is now a stepping stone. That is a very dangerous game to play. It is a deliberate strategy on the part of the British Government to play down the clock and I ask the Taoiseach to give his views on this again. I would like to hear him firm up the Dublin position in respect of June and to reiterate to Mrs. May's Government that we need an answer and that it needs to come forward by June with its proposed solution.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	Lord Kilclooney, also known as Mr. John Taylor, would be well advised to apologise for the slur that he attempted to cast on the Taoiseach. He is an ardent Brexiteer and has very hot feelings about Brexit but that does not permit him to use the kind of language he used yesterday. That said, the DUP heavily criticised the Taoiseach for his informal visit to Armagh and Down because local politicians were not informed in advance. There is a long-standing tradition south of the Border that when events of significance to local communities are taking place all public representatives, including Members of the Oireachtas and councillors, are invited. Given that he is still in the early days of being Taoiseach, is it his policy when he is presiding at significant public functions on either side of the Border to ensure that all local representatives are offered the opportunity to be present? The comments by the DUP are evidence of very strained relations. Has the Taoiseach been able to do anything to improve communications with the DUP? Does the Taoiseach have any plans to improve the relationship between his Government and the DUP? Who is in charge of protocol for these visits? Is it a joint arrangement between the Taoiseach's office and the Northern Ireland Office?

Two days before those protests began I begged the Taoiseach to condemn and speak out against any likely Israeli armed attack on those protests but the Taoiseach ignored me in the DÃ¡il that day. I have asked the Taoiseach about this every week since then, as the death toll has risen to 42. Unarmed protesters who represent no threat to human life have been shot down by Israeli armed forces. Those forces have admitted, in the face of protests by Israeli and Palestinian civil society, that they are using the rules of war and military engagement to deal with unarmed protesters. The UN has spoken out on this. Last week Mr. Ilan Baruch, the former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, compared what has been done in the last few weeks to Bloody Sunday. He said that these events are Palestine's Bloody Sunday but are happening week in, week out. He condemned the European Union, including Ireland, for its failure to use diplomatic means to deter Israel from such direct and brutal violence towards unarmed, non-violent Palestinian demonstrators. He asked if Irish and EU leaders preferred profitable economic co-operation with Israel over upholding international human rights. He went on to say that firing live ammunition at non-violent, unarmed demonstrators is "an act of inconceivable brutality, yet standing indifferently on the sidelines is inconceivable, too". He accused European governments, including the Irish Government, of doing exactly that. Where is the condemnation? Where are the expulsions and sanctions? We have absolute, deadly silence. Teenagers are being mowed down by snipers and nobody is doing anything. I ask the Taoiseach to say something about this.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	197	On about four occasions in the last six months I have asked the Taoiseach to detail the specific numbers of staff assigned to each area within this very broad division.This is something that previous taoisigh have been willing to do. Will the Taoiseach tell us exactly how many officials are working on the distinct roles of international affairs, EU affairs and Northern Ireland? Each of these areas has separate management positions within the Department. It should be eminently possible to disaggregate the number of officials in each area. A continued refusal to supply these numbers will suggest an intention to gloss over how few people are working on particular tasks that have been identified as national priorities. I described Brexit yesterday as an ugly campaign, among many other things. I think the remarks of former MP Taylor can be considered in a similar vein. One of the core elements of the work of this division relates to Brexit. The timetable is not clear. I have been criticised by Government Ministers for rearticulating, to some extent, what the TÃ¡naiste had said about the June deadline. If the June deadline is not reached, we will have to question whether it will be possible to get agreement by October. The TÃ¡naiste made remarks to that effect on the BBC. The Taoiseach said around the same time that he did not mind if this slipped to October. His position was quoted by the UK Secretary of State for Brexit, David Davis, in his effort to ignore the June deadline. We all got a sense yesterday that this will be resolved in October. That was the clear impression yesterday. The Taoiseach might have a contrary view. There is talk of substantial progress by June. Has anyone defined what "substantial progress" means? Is it still the Taoiseach's view that this can be resolved in October? Is he concerned about what appears to the twin-tracking of the final status negotiations and the resolution of the question of the island of Ireland, as Deputy Burton has set out?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	198	I thank the leaders of the various parties for attending the all-island civic dialogue and staying to hear the contributions of other leaders. Many leaders stayed well into the day to speak to some of the young people who were in attendance. I thank leaders for that. This valuable dialogue has taken place on a number of occasions. It is not just about politicians talking to politicians - it also involves politicians talking to farmers and business leaders etc. I am delighted that someone from the Orange Order attended yesterday's meeting. It was very welcome. It was very useful to have young people and people from all the different sectors in attendance. It was great to have Michel Barnier here in Ireland. He visited Dundalk and he went to the North as well. He heard from stakeholders and explained to them the EU's position with regard to Brexit. The EU is willing to make special treatment and special provisions for Northern Ireland that it cannot make for the UK as a whole. Regarding my visit to the North yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the port of Warrenpoint, which is one of the few ports in Ireland I had not previous visited. As a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I like my ports and airports. I also visited the Jethro Centre in Lurgan, which has received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It serves both communities but has its origin as the Protestant parish centre. The visit I enjoyed the most was my visit to New-Bridge Integrated College, which is one of the integrated education secondary schools in Northern Ireland. It is called New-Bridge because it is halfway between Newry and Banbridge and takes kids from both towns. It was really great to have a glimpse or an insight into what a shared future might look like in Northern Ireland. It is attended by kids from both communities and none. Many kids from new communities and migrant communities, including kids from Asian backgrounds, are there too. It gave me a great sense of what the new Northern Ireland might look like. My visit to Northern Ireland yesterday was deliberately low-key. I can tell Deputy Burton that I have to judge on the day of each visit what is the purpose of the visit. It was very much a low-key visit. I did not have an entourage of local politicians or politicians from the Twenty-six Counties of the Republic with me. I did not invite a big gaggle of media personnel either, although one or two journalists turned up. The particular reason I took this approach was that the only people I have met on my most recent visits to Northern Ireland have been officials and politicians. When I have tried to interact with people, I have found myself surrounded by officials and politicians, with the media snapping me and asking me questions. I wanted to talk to everyday people in a low-key manner about their concerns with regard to Brexit and about their hopes for the future. I wanted to hear from young people who live near the Border in Newry and Banbridge on how they feel about these issues. Approximately 40% of the traffic that comes into Warrenpoint, which is a very important port, turns left and comes across the Border into the Republic of Ireland. I also had a really interesting visit to the Jethro Centre. Regardless of what others might have to say about it, I certainly felt very welcome in Northern Ireland and I intend to visit again. There will be low-key visits and there will be full-protocol formal visits as well. I have to say that any time I go North of the Border, I feel very welcome on all sides. The protocol is that I contact the Northern Ireland Office. That is done by my protocol department. We have to do that because they provide security. We had some Police Service of Northern Ireland security with us. In the absence of an Executive, it is not possible to contact an Executive or Government in Northern Ireland. There is no Executive, so I contact the Northern Ireland Office instead. I saw Lord Kilclooney's tweet. I had thought it was a parody account, but seemingly it is not. It is for real. That is all I will say about that. The EU position with regard to June and October, which of course is Ireland's position because we negotiate as a group of 27 member states, is outlined in the guidelines. We will meet again at the June Council meeting to review progress. As the TÃ¡naiste has said, as I have said and as Michel Barnier has said, we need to see real and substantial progress on the text of the withdrawal agreement by June. If the withdrawal agreement does not contain a protocol on Ireland and on the Irish Border, there will be no withdrawal agreement. I think we are all very clear in that regard.

We condemn the shooting of unarmed civilians by the Israeli Defence Forces - let there be no doubt about that. Of course we also oppose violent protests and any illegal border incursions.

Cabinet Committee D last met on 1 February 2018. The next meeting of the committee has been scheduled for 8 May next. The overall objective of Cabinet Committee D on infrastructure is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the development and implementation of policy regarding housing, infrastructure investment and delivery, climate action and the delivery of Project Ireland 2040. Project Ireland 2040 is the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of our country. It includes the 20 year 2040 national planning framework, backed up by a â¬116 billion capital investment plan for the period from 2018 to 2027. The plan was launched in Sligo on 16 February last. My Department's main contribution to the plan was through the policy-making process. My senior officials and advisers were involved in formulating policy and drafting the text of the plan. As well as the launch in Sligo, I attended regional events in Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway. In addition, I attended the launch of the first of the sector-specific events, which was held on 10 April last and focused on investing in our culture, language and heritage, with some â¬1.2 billion to be invested in our culture, arts and heritage infrastructure over the next ten years. I have plans to attend two more sector-specific events, focusing on rural and climate action, in the near future. The implementation of Project Ireland 2040 is being overseen by the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, which is jointly chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government. The delivery board will have responsibility for the communications strategy for Project Ireland 2040. This work will transition from my Department to the board by July.
An investment projects and programmes office is being established in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to co-ordinate and drive the delivery of Project Ireland 2040.As with all major policy initiatives, my Department will support and participate in the delivery of Project Ireland 2040. Both Cabinet committee D and the full Government will review progress on a regular basis.

If it does not propose to have it enacted in law, what is the reason? Unless it is enacted in law, there is not a snowball's chance in hell that much of it will be implemented. Inevitably, it will cover the lifetime of three, four or five Governments, depending on how long they last. Perhaps it will be more. The Taoiseach indicated that he seems to be undertaking a roadshow across the country, attending many stage-managed events in third level institutions. He mentioned Sligo, Limerick and Galway, all of which have third level educational institutions. Who chooses the questions to be asked at these events or can students and others who attend these events ask anything they want? It seems the questions from people attending these events are slightly staged.

I asked the Taoiseach about the North because we would not have expected Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, MP, to get angry about local representatives in the North not being invited to the Taoiseach's event yesterday. He said the way the Taoiseach behaved showed poor manners and disrespect because no local representative was informed and none of the other normal local protocols was followed. That was reported in today's Irish News. People from all the political parties in the North will say there is a regular protocol, as there has been in the Republic, where public representatives are invited to events. The Taoiseach seems to want to exclude them.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	207	I will raise something different with the Taoiseach relating to Project Ireland 2040, specifically the construction of MetroLink. There is a general acceptance that this is a positive proposal and the infrastructure is long overdue. I raise with the Taoiseach the so-called emerging preferred route and the impact it will have specifically in Glasnevin, more specifically on St. Mobhi Road and more specifically again on Scoil ChaitrÃ­ona, Scoil MobhÃ­ and Na Fianna GAA club. Putting my cards on the table, this is not "nimbyism" and I do not live in the direct vicinity but my daughter is a student at Scoil ChaitrÃ­ona. I attended a meeting there last evening where the parents gathered. The problem is that notice of the construction of a station and boring holes that are massive in dimension was unceremoniously delivered to the desks of the GAA club and the respective schools. There was absolutely no consideration of the fact that the proposal is to put a massive building site alongside two schools, a scoil lÃ¡n-Ghaeilge and Scoil MobhÃ­, a bunscoil. There is a naÃ­onra as well in the vicinity. Representatives of Na Fianna and the schools were before the Oireachtas committee and they set out the massive disruption and the threat to the health and safety of very young children that this would represent. This is Bliain na Gaeilge and in that part of Glasnevin almost a breac-Ghaeltacht has grown up, almost organically, between the games, the language and the schools. There is a deep resentment among parents and residents that all of this is to be disrupted. I bring this to the Taoiseach's attention because he is a Dubliner and I am sure he knows Glasnevin pretty well. I know he is also keen on Gaeilge. I would like to hear his response.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	208	There is much to discuss in the short time I have and I will not be able to get around to all of it. The national development plan involved a significant tour of the country. University heads and those in institutes of technology love to greet members of the Government in the forlorn hope that the visit and their hospitality would be followed by numerous grants from the Government. Billions of euro have been promised all over the country and part of this relates to the metro project. I have visited Na Fianna and Home Farm and the two local schools are also seeing an impact. Many of these projects have had no serious in-depth cost appraisal or analysis, and some serious economists have pointed out that despite the promises, there has only been a cursory economic analysis of things like the metro and other big projects. There were promises without any great analysis. I was once advised by a very wise city manager who has passed to his eternal reward that one must be very careful of engineers planning, as they tend to go as the crow flies and they do not very often look at what is in the way. What is striking about Na Fianna is the extraordinary human resource, cultural, community and sporting endeavour that it represents. It has 3,000 members and is on 11 sites but this is its home. It is not just a GAA club but it is a community centre. It is the hub of the entire community. The value of voluntary human endeavour, which civilises a society and ensures an esprit de corps in communities, would be wiped out without a moment's thought by a proposal such as the metro. It is extraordinary that in the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, analysis, this area is not even identified as an obstacle. There are six major obstacles identified ahead of the plan but this is not identified as such. Home Farm has a pitch adjacent to the site. It needs a more holistic appraisal by the Government, and the Government must discuss this with TII and argue that it should go back to the drawing board and reconsider the options, and most notably this option. It has an impact on so much human capital. We have gone on about this in the north inner city and there is a project team dealing with the importance of human capital. This project would wipe that to naught and utterly destroy that human capital for a long time to come.

Did the committee discuss the absolutely shameful decision to sell the State's share in what are effectively the national film studios? They are both an important part of Ireland's cultural and film heritage and an important location for developing the film industry. Over the past number of weeks it was barely reported and seems not to have been discussed at all. The Comptroller and Auditor General must investigate the circumstances of the sale. When it was first mooted there might be a sale, the estimated value of the Government's share was â¬15 million. It has been reported in the press that the sale took place for â¬6 million but as part of the sale, â¬7 million in debt owed by Ardmore was written off, meaning we gave away the State's share in Ardmore for nothing and gave the purchasers â¬1 million on top of that. The purchaser was a company set up three to four weeks before the sale went through. It did not have a history of involvement in the film industry, although some of the people involved are connected with a rival studio in Limerick. Frankly, this stinks to high heaven, particularly when six of Ardmore's seven purpose-built stages have been empty for a period when there is supposed to be a lack of capacity in the Irish film industry. Films are being made in derelict NAMA buildings on the South Circular Road and Tallaght, where there have been major protests and disputes by film workers about the conditions in which they work. The State's studio, meanwhile, has been sitting empty and then we flogged the share. It is extraordinary stuff.I could say more, but I do not have time. What is going on? Grants given by the Irish Film Board are never repaid. There are serious matters that need to be looked into in this area.

To respond to the questions asked initially by Deputy Joan Burton, it is intended to place the national planning framework on a statutory footing, but I do not have a date in that regard. I understand primary legislation has to be passed first. I am not sure if it has yet been passed. However, the sequence is that it has to be passed and then the Minister can put the framework on a statutory footing. That is what is intended. One of the reasons the national spatial strategy failed was that it did not have statutory underpinning. We want to make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. That is why the national planning framework will be placed on a statutory footing. Yes, it is correct - I admit that I have been touring the country. I enjoy doing so and hope to continue to do so. It is great to get out of Dublin.

We will be following up this week on Project Ireland 2040 with an announcement of important flood relief works throughout the country. We hope to be able to start opening some of the funds this month - the urban regeneration fund and the rural regeneration fund - that are included in the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040. We want to open them to applications very soon and hope to make an announcement in that regard in the next couple of weeks. I reassure Deputies I do not choose the questions asked at these events. I do not know who does. In Sligo the questions were placed. However, they have not been since. In Waterford I was asked about the issue of 24/7 cardiac care services and the catheterisation laboratory. In Galway I was asked about student fees. The questions have been diverse and often not related directly to Project Ireland 2040. I assume they are not written by anyone in my Department, but it is correct that in Sligo they were placed. However, that has not been the case since. On protocol, if I travel to another jurisdiction, I inform the government in that jurisdiction. If I travel to Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Office is informed. That is the protocol and it is always followed, at the very least for security reasons. I will make low key visits, as appropriate. I honestly do not believe every time I visit some part of the country or some other country that it is necessary for me to be always surrounded by officials, public representatives and the media pack. It is good that I can make low key visits to schools, hospitals, ports, etc. I hope people will understand why I want to do so. I have done it before on a previous visit to Northern Ireland when I attended the Pride festival and breakfast. I am not sure if some of the people who have been criticising me might like to attend the Pride breakfast with me next year. I would very much welcome it, if they wished to do so.  I have to say I am a big supporter of MetroLink. In 2011 it was with deep regret that the project had to be postponed. It was my decision as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to postpone it because we could not afford it at the time. I am often criticised in other parts of the country for delaying and postponing transport projects. The biggest one I postponed was the one that affected my constituency. I refer to Metro North and Metro West. It was a difficult decision, but it had to be done, given the state of the country's finances at the time. The new proposal is even better. It is no longer Metro North but Metro north and south, going all the way from Lissenhall-----

On the specific issues raised by the Deputies, it affects Na Fianna, Scoil ChaitrÃ­ona and Home Farm and I am very concerned. I share the concerns of leaders and other Deputies, not least the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, about the emerging preferred route which would do enormous damage to Na Fianna and Home Farm, as well as to Scoil ChaitrÃ­ona. There is a planning process that involves a railway order, but my message to the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland would be to find an alternative option to digging up this important club which is the heart and soul of the community in that part of Dublin.

Normally I am not very successful in getting one selected for discussion, but on that occasion I managed to do so. I am asking the same question again today. It is to ask the Minister to provide her views on the recent child sex abuse case at a foster care home in County Galway; whether she believe the case warrants systematic change in Ireland's child protection services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	I am deeply sorry that the young lives of the three women who were in the foster home in Galway were blighted by abuse. Their devastating experiences while in a foster home in the care of the State are heart breaking. The immense bravery and determination shown by the three young women in this harrowing case is truly incredible. I am sure their strength has been greatly tested in sharing their story and for this, like many others, I thank them. The Deputy has asked if the case warrants systemic change in child protection services. It may do.  The national review panel commenced a review in 2016. The trial has ended and sentencing has taken place; therefore, it is expected to complete its work before the end of the summer. However, this is dependent on the length of time due process takes, as those affected will see the relevant portion of the report before it is finalised. It will examine the facts of the professional decision-making in this specific case. It will focus on the children who remained in the foster home after 2007, when the first disclosures were made.  I believe we should allow the national review panel, chaired by Dr. Helen Buckley, a child protection specialist, to conclude its work. The other members of the panel are Dr. Imelda Ryan, a retired child psychiatrist and specialist in child sexual abuse, and Dr. Ann McWilliams, a retired lecturer in child protection and foster care in the Dublin Institute of Technology and a specialist in foster care. I hope and expect that the review will provide answers. We should wait until we receive it and then assess if a deeper, more forensic examination is needed. I commit to coming back to the House to engage with Deputies when the report is submitted.  Improvements in the oversight of child protection have taken place. The Government, this House and previous Governments have made inroads. This needs to continue. The full commencement of the Children First Act, including the introduction of mandatory reporting, is evidence of this, but we still have a lot of work to do.

I do not know if she got to see the programme that aired on RTÃ. To be honest, it was hard to watch. As spokesperson on children, I found it incredibly difficult to watch. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has done much work on children in foster care and care leavers. We have had it as a central part of our topics for the past two years since the Minister took office. Two things stood out for me. The night the programme aired was the night an apology was issued.I happened to be at a particular public meeting on the Thursday night after my Topical Issue matter and it came up in conversation. What I did not realise is that the apology never went to the girls. I am not talking out of turn in saying as much this evening. It went out on RTÃ but the girls themselves never received the apology and I cannot understand it. The minimum to which these girls are entitled is an apology to their faces as opposed to one aired on RTÃ. What does the Minister think about that? What does the Minister think about an apology to the girls who were left there, especially since it was only when the story hit the media that the HSE and Tusla decided to render an apology, as opposed to apologising directly to the victims themselves?

Deputy Rabbitte asked me whether I saw the programme. Yes, I did. Even though I was away I saw the programme. It was very difficult to watch and I have acknowledged the bravery of the young women in coming forward. Deputy Rabbitte's second question was whether they should have received an apology directly from the HSE. I think so.

#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	Will the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs outline the progress being made by Tusla in allocating social workers to 4,892 cases where a social worker has not been allocated? Is she satisfied with the progress being made in hiring additional staff? Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	I thank the Deputy for her important questions. I will address the issue of unallocated cases first. Then I will deal with the recruitment of social workers. In February Tusla had 4,756 cases waiting for the allocation of a social worker. This has fallen from the 4,892 cases in December 2017, as referred to by the Deputy. This is consistent with the general downward trend in unallocated cases and represents a marked improvement on the 10,000 cases that were unallocated when Tusla was established in 2014. We have more work to do in this regard. I assure the Deputy that reducing the number of unallocated cases is a key priority for me and for Tusla. I support Tusla's efforts in this regard but I am not satisfied with the progress. Tusla provides monthly performance and activity figures to my Department, including the numbers of new referrals and cases allocated and unallocated. There is an increasing number of referrals being made to child welfare and protection services year on year, so the decrease in unallocated cases has to be measured against this increasing demand for Tusla services. I have been assured that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately. We know the solution to this problem. Addressing the shortage of social workers will reduce the number of unallocated cases. Tusla is in its third year of a three-year plan to recruit social workers. The additional â¬40 million that I secured for Tusla in 2018 will help to support that plan. Despite Tusla's vigorous recruitment efforts, however, the rate of progress in increasing the overall number of social workers is disappointing. I can inform the Deputy that of the 266 posts recently filled by Tusla, 157 are social work positions. Tusla expects these candidates to start work in the second quarter of this year. It must be understood, however, that the majority of these new staff will be replacing staff who have been promoted, retired or who have left the service. This indicates some of the challenges facing Tusla.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	I thank the Minister for her response, but I imagine she would agree with me that the fact almost 4,700 children are waiting on the allocation of a social worker is unacceptable. I recognise that the Minister secured extra funding in the budget to deal with staff shortages but I do not believe funding is the issue. We had an â¬11 million underspend in Tusla when it came to staff and costs. This is purely down to the fact that Tusla cannot hire or retain these important staff. Will the Minister outline what sort of discussions she has had with Tusla on this issue and whether a new approach is needed by Tusla to retain and hire additional social workers?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	I agree with Deputy Mitchell in respect of the question she has posed. I posed the same question to my officials in preparing the answer to the question of whether anything more can be done. I would take issue with one point. Tusla has engaged in a substantial recruitment and retention programme. In that context, although we are losing some we are gaining others. Our retention rate is higher than in other countries. I take issue with what the Deputy said in that regard. The Deputy asked whether anything else is going on and this is the case. We are in discussions with Tusla on the development of a strategy for a workforce plan. We believe several issues need to be identified to assist in the further recruitment and retention processes. I expect to receive a fuller version of that plan within the coming months.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	I acknowledge the steps being taken to deal with this issue but I find it alarming that we had 346 children deemed high priority who have been waiting more than three months. Worse again, Tusla could not tell us how long 87 children were waiting for social workers. I am not coming here to bash Tusla. I am well aware of the vast workload faced by its staff but I seriously believe something needs to be done to retain the staff. Is it the case that we have to look at the pay and conditions of these social workers? Why does the Minister think no one is applying for these jobs? Why is Tusla not recruiting more staff? Why is this recruitment programme not working?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	I believe it is working up to a certain point. Clearly, we are not receiving the number of social workers that we require. I have tried to indicate that the number leaving represents a retention issue. We are doing pretty well in that regard by comparison with other jurisdictions but we need to recruit more. Tusla is engaged on the matter. With my encouragement and the support of my officials, Tusla is also engaged in the development of a new strategic plan not only to take a look at how many social workers are needed but how to add an appropriate mix of social care workers and administrative workers as well. The idea is to take some of the work social workers are doing that may not need the experience of a social worker and reassign it to ensure they have more time to do what they need to do. Deputy Mitchell raised a second set of questions. I am assured that even though there may be cases involving a child or family which are unallocated, this does not mean a social worker or social work team is not responsible for ensuring they are checked in on until an allocated social worker is assigned specifically to the family in question. On the question of whether any of those children are not at risk, I am absolutely assured.

Is she satisfied with its progress? Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	I thank the Deputy for her question. I know she is interested in and supportive of the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. I am keen to provide a status update on the commission. It is important to reiterate that the commission is an independent statutory investigation. It was established by the Oireachtas in 2015 to examine the experiences of vulnerable women and children in mother and baby homes during the period 1922 to 1998. It is due to report in February next year. This work is a vital step on the path we have commenced down to establish the facts and what happened in and around these homes as well as to give true meaning to the values that define us as a people and a country. The commission continues to make progress under the leadership of Judge Yvonne Murphy, Dr. William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly.It has prepared three interim reports to date, in July 2016, September 2016 and September 2018, and I have published all three reports. As we know, the commission also confirmed the tragic discovery of juvenile remains interred on the site of the former home in Tuam. I am continuing to work with Galway County Council and relevant Departments to ensure appropriate decisions are taken regarding the future of the site. I know all Members are agreed on our collective desire to respect the dignity and memory of the children who lost their lives. The experts have advised us on what is possible. A public consultation on these options has recently concluded and I expect to bring proposals to Government in the near future. The commission is now more than three years into its programme of work. At its request, I extended its timeline for reporting to February 2019. I appreciate that many former residents were frustrated by the necessity for the 12-month extension of time even though they recognise the complexity and breadth of the task. There are simply no shortcuts to truth and accountability. I am satisfied the commission will effectively use the additional time to listen to the personal experiences of many more former residents and ensure crucial questions can be fully addressed.

As she said, one of its findings was the site in Tuam and the number of remains found there. It is a very complex issue. It is important also that the Minister acknowledged that the persons who were part of the mother and baby homes are very frustrated at this stage. They are looking for answers and for direction. What are the Minister's intentions regarding the treatment of the remains found at Tuam, or has she got any indications from the independent expert review group as to what their findings are or what are they indicating to her? The commission is three years into its programme of work and the people who were part of the mother and baby homes in Tuam are looking for some hope and assurance that the issue is being addressed. While they believe they have the Minister's ear, and I have said that at all times, they want to hear what is coming back from the experts.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	236	There are two ways to respond to that. More generally, in terms of the mother and baby homes and the time that work is taking, I have described - as I am aware the Deputy has also - great empathy for the waiting that the people are experiencing. In that context. I believe the Deputy is aware that I have taken a number of other actions to engage with the primary stakeholders and particularly, most recently, moving towards the establishment of a collaborative forum of 20 representatives, stakeholders, who will come together and take a look at key issues that they are concerned about and make recommendations to me while we await the report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes due in February of next year. Second, regarding Tuam, as the Deputy will be aware, the consultation process has concluded. The results of that are being discussed by an interdepartmental working group this week. In addition to that, the special rapporteur, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, provided me recently with a report on the human rights implications in terms of the issues particularly for families regarding what happened in Tuam. I believe the Deputy and other Members are aware - it was in the public domain - of a questioning of some of the conclusions of the expert group that I put together in order to offer options to the people to consider in their consultation in terms of technologies that can be used for determining DNA identification. I then asked my expert group to take a look at the submission presented to Galway County Council in terms of the consultation process by other experts in the field and they have come back to me recently with their views on that matter as well. A number of items are coming into me and I hope, as quickly as I can, to go to Government with recommendations on the basis of that work. As I said, an interdepartmental working group is meeting this week in order to examine those issues. 
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	237	I thank the Minister for her answer. She has outlined the complexity of what is involved and the various groupings with which she has to liaise. I and the people involved are very interested in the human rights aspect of this and the scope of the work that the special rapporteur on child protection has done on that. They would also be very interested to hear exactly how the engagement with Galway County Council is progressing. I have discussed with the Minister in the past that those involved believed there were various roadblocks along the way. They would be interested to hear about the human rights aspect of this and how the role of the coroner and that of Galway County Council in this work is progressing. Those are the obstacles that they as a grouping have found difficult. They look to the Minister to relay what are her findings. It would be helpful if she could indicate a timeframe for this. Does she plan to have this at Cabinet before we break at the end of the summer session?

With respect to the work of Galway County Council and the consultation it conducted using a variety of methodologies, I am aware there were criticisms about that as well, but it utilised a number of methodologies in order to get back from the people, as best it could, what different stakeholders felt regarding the options presented by the expert group. That report has only come to me recently and as I indicated that has gone to my interdepartmental working group. They are meeting this week on that. The Deputy asked questions regarding the report that Dr. Shannon has submitted to us. It was mentioned in the expert working group's report that they said they could not cover some of the human rights implications regarding the right to a proper burial, the right of families to have the identity of the remains and all those different issues that Dr. Shannon has considered in a very technical manner in terms of international law or EU law etc. and we are considering that now. With all those different items coming in, including the final report from Galway County Council, I am trying to push and move this as quickly as possible. I am aware of the concerns with respect to the stakeholders getting that as soon as possible.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16582	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	239	I want to ask the Minister what was the nature of her discussions with Scouting Ireland last week. We in this House demand transparency. I believe the Minister to be transparent in her dealings with all matters under the remit of her Department. For our own part, we have yet to ascertain what is in the details of the Elliott report. I am very anxious to hear from Mr. Ian Elliott as somebody who everybody across the divide would respect in terms of previous work he has done. I want to hear the Minister's perspective on the nature and content of the meeting that took place last week.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	240	When I became aware of governance issues within Scouting Ireland I decided to withhold the drawdown of further funding to the organisation under the youth service grant scheme. I wrote to the organisation on 13 April advising it of this decision and outlining my concerns. I also sought an urgent meeting to discuss governance issues within the organisation so as to give Scouting Ireland the opportunity to satisfy me that the organisation's governance standards are up to the required level. I subsequently had a useful meeting with Scouting Ireland on 19 April and I was briefed on the organisation's plan to reform the governance of the organisation and put new structures in place. Scouting Ireland also confirmed its commitment to implement Mr. Ian Elliott's recommendations in relation to safeguarding - his first report - and that it would also carry out a full review of historic cases. The Garda vetting of the individual referred to in media reports is in progress. The leadership of Scouting Ireland informed me that the organisation was involved in a governance process and reforms in the way it does its work, in particular at board level. These changes will be discussed at a special board meeting of the membership in June and in October. Scouting Ireland commissioned Mr. Ian Elliott to carry out a review into the organisation's handling of this allegation of the serious sexual assault on an adult volunteer by another adult volunteer. While this alleged assault took place in 2009, as the Deputy will be aware, it was only reported within the organisation in 2016. Mr. Elliott's report into this case resulted in the engagement by Scouting Ireland of a barrister to conduct a full investigation into this allegation, particularly with regard to the handling of the matter by certain senior volunteers. I have not yet received Mr. Elliott's report on this case but will receive it, together with the report of the barrister's investigation, once completed. Scouting Ireland is part funded by my Department. It has received funding of â¬438,168 so far from my Department in 2018 and it is funded up until the end of June. There are a number of steps to be taken before I can be assured that Scouting Ireland has the proper governance arrangements in place which would allow me to consider the restoration of funding.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16582	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	Do I take it then that the Minister has full confidence in the process that is under way within Scouting Ireland in regard to its governance and historical cases? Furthermore, will the Minister confirm, as per her assertion when myself and Deputy Rabbitte raised this in the House the week before last, that there are no further cases being dealt with in a historical context? My understanding is that the Minister informed this House that she had received calls to her office about the potential for further cases. Is that still the case? Is there only one sample case at play here or are there other complaints? Is the Minister willing to again acknowledge the vital role thousands of volunteers play throughout the island of Ireland in everyday scouting activities, that they are utterly sacrosanct in terms of maintaining child protection policies and procedures and that there is no blemish whatsoever on ordinary members of the scouts throughout this island and that it is important that we reiterate that in this House?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	Let me start with the Deputy's last question because I appreciate where it is coming from. I am committed to and appreciate the work of the thousands of volunteers in Scouting Ireland. There is no question about that. Every action that I have taken in regard to this issue is because of my deep respect for them and my desire to ensure that they can continue to have an organisation that they are proud of and that can work in the best possible manner in terms of that ethos of volunteerism. I deeply appreciate the work that all of them are doing. In regard to the Deputy's first question about whether I am assured by the processes in which Scouting Ireland is engaged to reform its governance matters, we had a meeting at which we had a lengthy conversation. I had numerous questions which were able to be answered at that time but much work needs to be done and action taken. In that regard, I would also like to inform the House that I have asked Jillian van Turnhout, as an independent expert, to examine the situation over the coming weeks. In accordance with her terms of reference, she is being asked to provide me with a clear assessment of the adequacy of Scouting Ireland's governance arrangements and to advise me on whether I can be assured about Scouting Ireland's governance and related matters. As that comes in, I have also engaged another expert to work with me to ensure that what changes happen are in the best interests of reforming Scouting Ireland, particularly in regard to its governance.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16582	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	243	The Minister will forgive me but I must have missed something in the dispatches. It is news to me that Jillian van Turnhout was appointed by the Minister. I must have missed the press release on that one. As a former Senator, I think we all have confidence in the fact that she has been appointed to that role. Does the Minister envisage that the Elliot report will be published? When will the Minister restore funding? It is vital, notwithstanding the process that is under way, to restore funding and have a direction of travel to restore that funding. It is an entity that represents thousands of volunteers. I am still unclear in my own mind - that is why I cannot wait to have an interrogation of Scouting Ireland's internal procedures - as to how the funding flows down into individual troops. There seems to be a disparity between what happens at the head of the organisation and at the bottom of the organisation. There seems to be a gap between ordinary members and those within the upper echelons of the organisation. I welcome the appointment of Jillian van Turnhout but merely want to ask the Minister that question.

That is what I am doing. I am not tacking anything on. In regard to the Deputy's question on Mr. Elliott's report, as I stated, I have not even seen it yet. I am also expecting the other report. I expect it would be useful to it into the public domain. Usually one has to get some kind of legal view on the publishing of such reports and we will have to go through that process. In regard to the Deputy's funding question, as he will be aware, I have funded it until the end of June. Scouting Ireland has informed me that it has reserves, and I will leave it at that. I have funded it until the end of June. At the point when I have acceptable assurances on its governance, I will restore its funding.

Deputy Rabbitte met a group from Mosney at the recent ForÃ³ige awards and was most impressed with them. Does the Minister believe that children seeking asylum in Ireland are treated equally and fairly by Ireland's child welfare and protection services, particularly in the allocation of social workers and aftercare provision, and is she satisfied with existing arrangements?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	It is vital that we treat all children who are received into State care equally. There should be no differentiation in standards of care, priorities for care, other standards or protocols. I am satisfied that the care provided to separated children seeking asylum is of a high standard, and that they receive an equal standard of care. Children seeking asylum who are in the custody of their parents remain in their care. Families living in direct provision centres have access to all Tusla services and are supported by a senior Tusla social worker, who works closely with the Reception and Integration Agency and staff in direct provision centres. Children who present as unaccompanied minors may reunite with family members on arrival, or are taken into the care of Tusla. All separated children in care have a social worker with access to translation services where necessary. They live in residential or foster care, have educational assessments on arrival, and supports. Many of them, on reaching 18, stay in Tusla-provided accommodation to assist them in remaining in education. Tusla provides dedicated aftercare supports to this group of young adults. Ireland's treatment of separated children seeking asylum is well-regarded internationally. Tusla has had a dedicated separated children seeking asylum team for many years now and it has gained the knowledge, skills and experience to provide a good quality service to separated children. We have a good record in assisting unaccompanied children who arrive in Ireland. We played our part in helping children from the unofficial camp at Calais, and Tusla has offered to do more in regard to Italy and Greece. We remain in contact with the Irish refugee protection programme, and we will continue to support vulnerable children under this programme.

I could not agree with her more but unfortunately it would seem there is a differentiation. The Minister also said that Ireland is regarded very highly for the way it supports these children yet in September 2006, in its review of Ireland's implementation of the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the relevant UN committee specifically raised with the Irish delegation the question of discriminatory treatment for children of asylum seekers. The former Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, frequently drew attention to the particular difficulties faced by the children of asylum seekers in Ireland. In 2008 she observed that children who seek protection in the State, especially separated children seeking asylum and child victims of trafficking, are among the most vulnerable in our society and face multiple barriers to the realisation of their rights. Until recently the Ombudsman for Children excluded children living in direct provision from making complaints. It is welcome that it has changed recently but many residents still fear making a complaint because of their very precarious status.

Even though they are in the care of their families, there are a number of services available to them through Tusla. We have a dedicated Tusla person who regularly works with all direct provision centres throughout the country to ensure they have access to services as do children who are in the care of their families. The Deputy's question was about those children being treated equally and fairly compared with children who are separated and who are not in the care of their families. It is very important to Tusla. A number of practices have been developed with my support to ensure they have as good a service as they require given they are separated from their families and that they receive an equal standard of care in that regard.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	Many social workers have raised concerns about the lack of inter-agency co-operation between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. This has a negative impact on their ability to serve children seeking asylum. It is in direct contravention to the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2001, which asks all Government Departments and agencies to collaborate in the protection of children. For example, Tusla social care workers highlighted that many children seeking asylum are deported with very little warning. There is no engagement with the social care worker. It is wrong and very worrying. The open nature of direct provision means sometimes children can be exposed to unsuitable persons and behaviours. We all accept that direct provision can be an inherently stressful experience causing additional mental health and educational issues. The opportunity for children to go on to further education is hugely important. Unaccompanied minors who are placed in foster care are discharged from State care at 18 years old and, essentially, must enter direct provision or be entirely cut off from State support. While the Department maintains that these minors have the same right to an aftercare plan as any other child in foster care, that is far from the reality. Will the Minister consider those issues? Are there any steps she will take to alleviate those challenges?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	Tusla provides dedicated aftercare supports to the group of young adults who reach 18, after they are 18. It uses its resources to do that. On the question on children in direct provision who are in the care of their families, some of the questions relate to direct provision, which is under the remit of another Ministry. Perhaps some of the Deputy's questions are appropriate in that regard. In the context of my responsibilities, I work very closely with the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure our officials, including the Tusla officials in my Department, come together with the gardaÃ­ in a number of working groups, including the strategic liaison committee and other working groups, to look at ways of ensuring the protocols and the ways of working together to support children in care are of the highest possible standard. We also acknowledge that reforms are needed. They have identified actions and they are being implemented on a number of levels. They are being implemented at a higher level with the Garda and my officials in Tusla in addition to the work that is going on on the ground. I am happy to say I have visited a number of direct provision centres around the country with an eye on ensuring the children who are there in the care of their families have access to the Tusla services I have indicated.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	Bethany Home is one of the institutions included within the terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. This particular institution was one of the first identified for inclusion when the scope of the investigation was being decided. Decisions on the issues to be investigated by the commission were informed by the serious concerns about the care and welfare of children in the institution. As I have outlined in response to an earlier question, the final reports of the commission are expected within the next ten months. It is important to note the independent commission of investigation has to date made no findings about abuse or neglect in any of the homes within its terms of reference. In these circumstances, it is not possible for the Government to put in place a redress scheme for matters within the scope of this investigation prior to the commission submitting its findings and conclusions. In the interim, the Government has agreed to consider the health and well-being needs of former residents. The establishment of a collaborative forum is a progressive approach to assist former residents to prioritise areas of concern for them and their families.  Given the issue of mother and baby homes has not been central to any previous inquiry, the commission must be given the opportunity to advance its investigation and to establish the facts of what happened in and around these institutions. When the Ryan report was published in 2009 there were a number of calls for the residential institutions redress scheme to be extended to include additional institutions, including the Bethany Home. The then Government decided not to extend the scheme and it has been closed to new applicants since 2011. This decision has been reviewed on a number of occasions by previous Governments and most recently following the publication of the commission of investigationâs second interim report last year. The Government again concluded it was not possible to reopen the scheme. The challenges for Government in considering such matters at an interim stage of a commissionâs work were further highlighted in the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the residential institutions redress scheme.  As I previously indicated, when the final reports of the commission are available, the Government will listen to and respond to the full account of the commissionâs conclusions and the matters regarding the treatment of former residents.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	I cannot understand the attitude of the State to this small group of survivors. There are fewer than ten survivors. They are getting on in years and they fear the State is using this as a stall and hoping they will pass away. The second interim report by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes clearly stated its view that the survivors of the Bethany Home had a strong case for redress and that both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health should re-examine the decision to deny the Bethany Home survivors redress. We recently saw the decision to reverse access to redress for Magdalen laundry survivors. Why can it not be done for the Bethany Home survivors? I will say it straight to the Minister. These ten survivors will be very disappointed; they will feel let down.Will the Minister be the one who puts it right? 
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	I have a deep understanding of how upset and disappointed the survivors, especially of the Bethany Home institution, feel. I understand what the Deputy has described. I am aware of it and fully aware of what the commission of investigation stated in its second interim report and brought those arguments to the Government. That is why we took a long time to deliberate on the report, with a detailed analysis by officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other Departments of the rationale for some of the commission's statements. The consensus from a series of discussions which involved the Attorney General, the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills was that there would be insurmountable difficulties in reopening the redress scheme or scoping an alternative scheme, whether statutory or non-statutory. One of the primary reasons for this is that to date the commission has made no finding about abuse or neglect in the homes. That makes it extremely difficult for the Government to decide to offer redress. As a bridge to the final report, having understood and empathised with the concerns, particularly those expressed by the Bethany Home institution, I encouraged and achieved consensus with other Ministers that the Government could begin discussions with the former residents to examine meaningful targeted supports, particularly health and well-being supports, that could be provided for them prior to receiving the final reports of the commission and the Government's decisions which would follow them.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	I do not doubt that the Minister feels for the survivors, but they have been listening to that response for decades. Other Deputies and I believe that is not right as it is denying the survivors justice and redress. Why has the commission not made a finding? Is there something deliberate going on? The Minister has met the survivors; she knows them and knows that they have been campaigning tirelessly for decades.

I have had meetings and conversations with it and it has insisted that it needs more time to speak to and hear from the people involved. Many more have come forward than initially anticipated. It needs time to consider their histories and conduct investigations before it can state what are the facts and its findings. All I can say is the commission has stated there is more work to be done and that it requires time. We have acceded to its request.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	264	I am deeply conscious that giving testimony to a commission and revisiting difficult personal experiences will be distressing for many former residents. I know that some people may need to access various supports around this time. I also acknowledge that the Deputy has raised this issue recently and thank her for highlighting this important matter.  I have previously advised that any person affected by experiences connected to mother and baby homes may wish to contact the Health Service Executive, HSE, national counselling service which provides free professional, confidential counselling and psychotherapy services in all regions of the country. I have ensured relevant HSE contact details are available on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. With regard to the commission of investigation, it is important to recognise that the statutory commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations. I am aware that it does ask former residents attending as witnesses if they have access to supports and whether they would like information on available services. I understand that, if they so wish, this information is provided. The individual arrangements with witnesses are, of course, a matter for the commission and I have no role in that regard. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with details of any specific case, I will be happy to raise them with the Minister for Health. Officials of my Department have been engaging with counterparts in the Department of Health on the issue of health and well-being supports. This is in the context of the establishment of the collaborative forum which I am in the process of setting up. As the Deputy may be aware, I have embraced the concept of "nothing about us without us" which has emerged from my engagements to date with former residents. Former residents, rightly, want and deserve an input into the decisions which affect them and their families.  Health and well-being supports are one of the priority areas to be considered in the collaborative forum process. Participants in the forum will identify and prioritise actions and recommendations on issues of concern to them and their families. I have asked them to examine in particular the matter of health and well-being supports as a priority and come back to me with recommendations.

Health and well-being supports are under discussion and consideration has been given to those who were resident in the institutions and would like to access such supports. This issue was discussed in the initial consultations, as well as in the consultations on what would be considered at the collaborative forum. I certainly want us to be able to offer these supports. Officials in the Departments have asked if that is the case and whether we want to decide on how they will be provided in a way that is most accessible to the women and in a manner that they will be able to access them when they need them.

Many women have been attending counselling services during the years at a cost to themselves. When they make their initial appointment, they find they must move from that counsellor. Many women who have developed a relationship with the counsellor they have attended for years have to move to a different one. Can some mechanism be put in place to ensure survivors will be able to stay with the counsellor they already have?

I know from personal experience that it is very important. That kind of issue has been and will continue to be considered in the context of how we can offer these supports once we have discussed the matter and decided we can do it.The practical issues take time to sort out but they are important in order that all of the women about whom we are speaking can have access in a timely manner and in a way that would be most useful to them.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 32 together. I have not yet received a copy of the Elliott report into the handling of allegations involving the alleged serious sexual assault by an adult volunteer. Scouting Ireland commissioned Mr. Ian Elliott to carry out a review into the organisationâs handling of this allegation of a serious sexual assault on an adult volunteer by another adult volunteer. In 2017, Scouting Ireland engaged Mr. Ian Elliott to conduct a review of its child safeguarding-protection policies and procedures. An interim report was produced in October 2017 and a final report was produced in January 2018, both of which were subsequently submitted to my Department in March 2018. In view of the information available to me relating to the governance arrangements within Scouting Ireland, I decided to withhold the drawdown of further funding to the organisation under the youth service grant scheme until I am satisfied that the organisation's governance standards are up to the required level. The report mentioned by the Deputy is not yet completed. Following on from the report on child protection matters, Scouting Ireland engaged a barrister to conduct a full investigation into the allegation, particularly with regard to how the matter was handled by senior volunteers. I will receive both reports once the investigation is completed. As I said in response to a previous question, I met Scouting Ireland on 19 April and I was informed of the organisation's plan to reform the governance of the organisation and to put new structures in place. The organisation also confirmed its commitment to implement the recommendations relating to safeguarding and to carry out a full review of historic cases. Scouting Ireland is implementing the recommendations of the first report in terms of safeguarding and it is awaiting the second report. Both reports will be submitted to me. There are a number of steps to be taken before I can be assured that Scouting Ireland has the proper governance arrangements in place to allow me to restore funding.

Does she believe the board of Scouting Ireland will be able to implement the necessary changes before next June and how confident is she in the board? Also, does she have a contingency plan in the event of the board not being able to deliver the necessary changes such that she may be left with no options at the end of June?

We had a strong and robust conversation. I put a number of questions to the board and it indicated the actions that it proposes to implement to reform the governance of the organisation. The drawdown which the organisation has will continue to resource it. The board also indicated to me that it has reserves. The timeframe within which actions are implemented in order that I am provided with assurances that governance is appropriate and of the standard required of an organisation in receipt of public moneys is a matter for the board.

How confident is she that the board will be able to implement the necessary changes and, in the event that it does not do so, what contingency does she have in place? Has she set a timeframe within which the process of implementing the changes must be up and running or is she allowing the board to move at a pace which it deems fit? Has the Minister set a deadline for completion of the report, is she expecting receipt of same over the next few days or weeks, and will she publish it when it becomes available to her? How confident is the Minister that the board can deliver on the changes required?

I know from its description of the processes that the putting in place of the necessary reforms is dependent on a number of factors and people. As the Deputy is aware, subsequent to my meeting with the board, a number of board members agreed to stand aside until such time as the process of investigation is completed. I believe this demonstrates the understanding of the board of the seriousness of this matter from my perspective. The board knows that it needs to get this right and I agree that the stepping aside of the chief scout and others was the right thing to do. On contingency plans, the organisation has moneys available to enable it to continue operating. My Department is not the only Department from which it receives funding. As I said, the board indicated to me that it has reserves. It is the responsibility of the board to ensure that funding and resources are made available to Scouting Ireland to enable it to carry out its great work.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	I was pleased to secure an additional â¬40.6 million for Tusla in 2018. This is the third year in succession that Tusla has received a significant increase in its funding, which now amounts to more than â¬753 million. I am satisfied that Tusla has sufficient resources to act on mandatory reporting. I support the work of Tusla and I am committed to supporting the agency in meeting the growing needs of children and families. The extra resources secured for Tusla in 2018 will assist in meeting key priorities. The additional investment will allow Tusla to recruit a range of additional staff to respond to areas of identified risk and to meet increased demand for services, including an anticipated increase in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting. This increase in funding is also enabling the further management of unallocated cases. In addition, Tusla is in the process of recruiting more administrative staff to support social workers in their child protection duties. In 2018, funding is also being used to establish a single national out-of-hours social work service, building on significant progress made in recent years in strengthening this service. The extra resources will also support enhanced collaboration with An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, additional on-call social work capacity and a new out-of-hours support service for foster carers. I have requested that Tusla develop a robust workforce plan which addresses succession planning, retention, career pathways, training and development, future workforce needs, priority gaps and a strategy for tackling the priority gaps. The workforce plan will be a key part of dealing with a rise in referrals due to mandatory reporting and in helping to reduce unallocated cases. I believe that the level of Exchequer funding of more than â¬753 million available to Tusla in 2018 provides it with the resources to increase its capacity significantly to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand. The introduction of mandatory reporting will no doubt bring challenges but the resources to help Tusla deal with these challenges are in place.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	277	I appreciate the Minister's answer but I am going back to last September when the chief executive officer, Mr. Fred McBride, suspected that â¬40.6 million would be insufficient to introduce mandatory reporting and a host of other services. When he appeared before the Oireachtas committee he said that mandatory reporting was going to increase Tusla's workload by 150%. Month on month we see HIQA reports where it has gone into various centres and we see the basic fundamentals on Garda vetting and so on are not up to scratch. We see also that there is a lack of engagement of social workers. I am not as fully convinced as the Minister, but she has the Department to best advise her. I do not believe that Tusla has the resources. Another concern is Tusla's workforce plan. When will we have a timeline on a workforce plan given that more than â¬700 million is going into that operation? I would like to see how this funding is being spent and how it plans to spend it going into the next budget. Mandatory reporting is up 20% since it was introduced last year.

The CEO, my officials and I have continued the conversation throughout this time. The Deputy is aware that I made the decision to bring mandatory reporting of child abuse concerns into effect on 11 December 2017. I do not think the sky fell in. In advance of the commencement, Tusla put in place the structures and processes necessary to facilitate the intake of mandated reports. Mandated reporters are required to make their reports in writing and they have a legal entitlement to an acknowledgement. Since 15 January, Tusla has an online portal to receive mandated reports. People can register online via the Tusla website. They are then in a position to submit reports directly to Tusla. There were 4,477 referrals to child protection and welfare services in February 2018. This was a decrease of 8% from January 2018. The February 2018 referrals represent a 10% increase from February 2017 referrals and figures. At this early stage, it is not possible to establish if overall numbers of reports to Tusla have increased with the introduction of mandated reporting. It will be kept under review in 2018 in the normal performance of monitoring engagement between Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I am confident that with the implementation of the obligation for mandated reporting Tusla is responding, has put measures in place and, as the Deputy is aware, has worked with an inter-departmental group for the last couple of years so that other Departments were prepared also.

We believe it is a step in the right direction. It may or may not have been a throwaway comment, but the sky is falling in for the 898 children who have not been allocated a social care worker. Last year the One in Four charity raised its concerns about Tusla. It explained that Tusla was not adequately resourced to monitor two out of three of the cases the charity had raised with a credible report of child sex abuse that had been made. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, has raised its doubts over Tusla's ability to protect children given the repeated failure of many Tusla care facilities to pass HIQA inspections. Yet again I am sure the Minister is in negotiation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, for her Department's budget. She will be looking for an allocation for extra resources and I am sure it will go back to the workforce plan Tusla will be putting forward. I am sure the Department is looking critically at the numbers around mandatory reporting. Does the Minister believe she will be pitching for more money in the upcoming budget, solely on the back of the CEO's remarks?

The system did not crash. With regard to the unallocated cases, I have already acknowledged that where there are cases of children and families not being assigned a social worker, it does not mean that social workers are not communicating with them. Duty social work teams are ensuring those families are being communicated with regularly and ensuring there is no risk to children. I have confidence in that. Of course, I will be looking for more resources for Tusla for a number of our priorities. As I have tried to describe in answers to other questions, it is a real challenge to get social workers in order to reduce those unallocated cases but even with the increase in referrals, the trend in respect of the number of unallocated cases is going down. This does not necessarily make a family that has not been allocated a social worker feel any better about it. I appreciate this and I have empathy. We are, however, looking at the overall trend going down. At the same time, we need to recruit more. We have had a draft of the workforce plan. Our officials are discussing this and are working very closely on it so that it meets all of the requirements, which I have already identified.

Following the ESRI report and the Tusla commissioned employment audit, perhaps the Minister will give an update on the status of the school completion programme and her views on it.

However, the ESRI review referred to by the Deputy highlighted the need for a fit-for-purpose structure with effective governance and employment models in place. With this in mind, the board of Tusla convened an expert panel to identify and examine a potential revised model of good practice and governance of the school completion programme. The panel comprised an external legal expert, representation of the Tusla educational welfare service, finance, human resources and legal units, representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It was chaired by the Tusla CEO. The expert panel has concluded its work. When I examined its findings, I decided to carry out some further discussions with a number of other stakeholders. To this end, I hosted a very informative school completion consultation event in Farmleigh House on 29 January 2018. Matters discussed included best practice and governance within the school completion programme. There was a range of views expressed as to how both these elements could be improved to ensure that the best service possible is delivered to those who need it. Following the Farmleigh event, I asked the facilitator of the day to do some additional work on a possible way forward, and I have received this input very recently. I have deliberated carefully over this process for some time because the issues are complex and I want to achieve the best possible results for the young people who use the service and for the professionals who deliver it. I wish to see plans for the development of the school completion programme advanced in this quarter. I am very much aware of the positive outcomes that have been achieved in the school completion programme. For example, the proportion of students in DEIS schools who completed the senior cycle has increased from 68% in 2006-2007 to 82% by 2016. This illustrates the benefit of the programme. I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the Tusla educational welfare service are fully committed to the future of the school completion programme and will continue to work to ensure that it will deliver the best possible outcomes for young people at risk of early school-leaving.

It is good to hear about the progress that has been made and the steps the Minister has taken. It is the reality that, for many reasons, there are children who find it difficult to stay in school. We know how important it is for a young person to stay in school for as long as possible. It is good that school principals were generally positive about the impact of school completion programmes and the staff involved. We can see how the programmes secure improved educational outcomes for young people. The Minister and I both come from constituencies where we can see the reality for those who do not stay in school and for those who do not engage in education. We are aware of the need for the extra supports that can go in there. In all the consultation that was held with those who deliver the programme, will the Minister clarify whether their voices were also heard? Did the people who deliver the programmes take part in the initial audit and the review with the various officials mentioned by the Minister?

Subsequent to the larger event to which I referred, I have been to a number of schools.I always seek out the school completion co-ordinators to hear from them directly about any concerns they may have about their own position, the project workers, contract workers and sometimes teachers who work with them on the programme, how it is and the challenges principals and members of the board of management of the school see with governance issues that have been raised. I have been able to hear all those things first-hand in the context of a number of schools as we deliberate about the best way forward to reform the governance, the programmes that are offered, the services in the context of the educational welfare service and the challenges relating to the employment of the people who do the work.

It is significant and central to the school completion programme that it is flexible, can address needs in an area and is not a rigid programme. I know there are certain parameters within that programme but it is good that there is movement outside it. The relationship between school completion programmes and the home school liaison officers is very important. I imagine we will come back to this once I look at the other events at Farmleigh and where it led.

I agree with the Deputy that the space for flexibility and innovation in the context of the delivery of the school completion programme is absolutely key. I know, within the context of Tusla's work with the school completion co-ordinators and programmes throughout the country, that they have worked very diligently to provide continuous professional development, working with school completion co-ordinators, some of which relates to focusing on that flexibility and space for innovation, while at the same time ensuring, having identified the needs in those particular communities, if they want and decide to use models of best practice, that that is also within their remit.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	289	Since the inception of the early childhood care and education programme, ECCE, age limits have been used to determine eligibility for the scheme. These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose. In 2010, only one ECCE year, or 38 weeks, was available. I enhanced this in 2016 and, on average, children benefitted from 61 weeks. From this September, the additional investment I secured in budget 2018 will enable all children from the age of two years and eight months to be eligible for two programme years. While children will be eligible for two years of ECCE, not all parents choose to avail of it. There are two factors that prevent absolute standardisation of how much time children will utilise from the two years available. As Deputies are aware, school entry occurs at one point in the year, September, but children are born across the full year. Parents can opt to start their children in school at either four or five years of age. I fully accept that the use of age limits in a scheme such as this creates a situation whereby a child can fall just outside the age range. Under current rules, children born in January are most affected. However, we have to place an age cut-off at some point, whether this is at two years and eight months, or higher, or lower than this. The scheme as it exists provides eligibility for two years but enables parents to decide how much of ECCE is in the best interest of their child. I have asked for a consultation with the parents of children with disabilities, as I think the Deputy is aware, with regard to how the age limits affect them and I am due to receive the report on this consultation in late June. I will be happy to update Deputies as soon as possible thereafter on any changes to the scheme as a result of this consultation. I am conscious that age-based rules can be somewhat confusing, but my Department will continue to promote good communication of the ECCE scheme, so that parents and providers are clear about the rules involved.

I also acknowledge that she has brought it back to one entry point. There had been much confusion about that. Going back to the entry point, children that are two years and eight months old on 1 September cannot enter into the two-year ECCE scheme. That is where the problem is. Can the Department look at this in another way so that two years before a child starts school, he or she would be allowed to enter into the ECCE scheme? I know what I am saying is simplistic but age has been a barrier here and it has been so prescriptive that the childcare providers themselves have to know exactly who they will get funding from. I can see it completely from their point of view. Parents might choose to let their children be that little bit older or younger and, as the Minister said, children born in January are particularly caught. Is there any way the Minister can work with the Department? She did it already, which I have to acknowledge, with the upper age limit. She has already overcome that obstacle. Is there enough time between now and September to make it non-prescriptive, so that children can get their two years?

I understand the Deputy's concerns and think they are real. She represents her constituents very well. I thank her for acknowledging that we have almost got over that exemption issue. We are finalising the consultation and expect to come forward with some results in light of that. I have indicated that it is possible that the outcome of those consultations may give rise to policy proposals that might have a wider impact on the ECCE scheme in general as well as the issue of the school age exemptions. We may be able, in the context of that consultation, to consider these wider issues. Maybe decisions or recommendations will have been found. As the Deputy would be aware, any changes could have financial implications, some of them significant.

We are looking at approximately 58,000 children. It is not 58,000 children who will be impacted by any manner or means. It is a cohort of children who are that age. If we say we are giving ECCE to all children and that we are doing early intervention, we should give them that opportunity. We would be giving a little control back to parents. Also, if childminders or childcare providers in crÃ¨ches know that flexibility is there, which the Minister is talking about the possibility of, is now not the time to iron it out and to have the conversation from the start to the end so that we can give that clarity to parents?

These considerations are happening in the context of that other consultation. I understand that if the policy is to offer two years, parents hope to be able to access that. To give the Deputy a practical response, specific to what we were speaking about there with regard to the January issue, to resolve the concerns being raised, my Department would have to further lower the age limit to two years and five months, possibly. If we were to do that, this would have cost implications. A further â¬20 million per annum would be required. It would place a greater burden on ECCE providers as many children in the age group are not toilet trained. It could also have an impact on ratios. These are the kinds of issues being considered in the context of those very real questions and concerns that parents are raising about children's age.

Athy family and community centre and Teach Dara in Kildare town are very grateful and worthy recipients of full family resource centre status. My question is about the funding model in place for centres which predate the 11 announced recently such as Newbridge family resource centre and Curragh Pride in Kildare, and plans for a review of that model.

As Deputy Martin Heydon is aware, family support is an important priority for me, as reflected by the increased level of funding for family resource centres in 2018. Family resource centres are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve. They act as a focal point within their communities and provide an holistic service to support children and families. They operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, while also proactively targeting specific cohorts within their communities. As the Deputy is aware, 109 family resource centres were in receipt of funding from Tusla at the end of 2017. Tusla was provided with additional funding of â¬3 million in 2018 to expand the programme, with the inclusion of 11 additional centres, two of which are in Kildare.

I acknowledge that the Deputy's question is about existing family resource centres and the increases they can receive. This year family resource centres will receive an increase of up to â¬10,000 in funding. Funding for individual family resource centres varies, depending on a range of factors, including the size and population of the catchment area, the degree of economic disadvantage in the area and the existing distribution of services in the area. Decisions on funding levels for 2019 will be taken in the context of the Estimates process. It is not possible at this stage to advise what level of funding will be available to the family resource centre programme next year. However, I strongly value the work of family resource centres in communities throughout Ireland and will be making a case for continued investment in them in 2019 and beyond.

I note that family resource centres receive varying funding allocations based on the size and population of the cathchment area. Is there a mechanism for existing family resource centres to make a case to the Department or Tusla for additional funding for extra services? Are there plans to provide capital grants for such centres? Newbridge family resource centre is bursting at the seams. It is using prefabs as extra accommodation and needs a capital grant to enable it to extend the existing building. Will a mechanism be put in place through which family resource centres will be able to seek to expand their premises? We are coming out of the lost decade. As the economy continues to improve, it is to be hoped funding for the Minister's Department will be increased in the next budget, as it was in previous budgets. I support the Minister in her endeavours in that regard because we have seen the great value for money she has achieved for the funding allocated to the Department in the previous budget. As overall funding increases, we must play catch-up. Funding for existing family resource centres such as those on the Curragh and in Newbridge must be increased to make up for the cuts they endured during the recession.

As he is aware, the priority in budget 2018 was to open new family resource centres, as well as trying to give more to existing centres, subject to the initial maximum figure of â¬10,000. There will be scope for engagement on different ways to make decisions on existing family resource centres according to the criteria I have identified. The Deputy's suggestion and raising of the issue are helpful in the context of their being the kind of things Tusla will consider as we move forward. I specifically highlighted the need for additional capital investment in family resource centres in the context of the development of Project 2040 or the national development plan. I will revert to the Deputy to specify my hopes in that regard for the coming year. I am aware of the need for capital investment in family resource centres.

This is the time of year in which to make a case for increased funding in advance of the budget and clearly show what could be done with that funding. The Minister acknowledged the vital role played by family resource centres in their communities by recently opening 11 new centres, two of which are in south Kildare. However, we must also ensure provision will be made for the existing 109 family resource centres, including those on the Curragh and in Newbridge which I specifically mentioned and of which I have an in-depth knowledge. Such centres do fantastic work, as the Minister acknowledged, as does Tusla. We must ensure such centres can make a case for more funding where they see new programmes that would benefit the community or recognise that far more could be done with a little extra funding. It is to be hoped that in future budgets extra resources will be made available for such centres as the economy continues to improve.

#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	Two weeks ago, on 18 April, a 19 year old man, Mr. Harry Boland, was knocked down and killed while cycling on the Stillorgan dual carriageway. His death was a terrible tragedy for his family. I offer my condolences to his parents, brother, extended family and all of his friends. I bring forward this Topical Issue and mention the death of Mr. Harry Boland because, unfortunately, his tragic death meant that he was the sixth cyclist to be killed on the roads this year. It is regrettable that the number of deaths of cyclists on the roads has increased in the past two years. In 2017, 15 cyclists were killed on the roads, an increase on the ten killed in 2016. So far this year six cyclists have lost their lives. I raise this Topical Issue to ask the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who I am pleased to see in the Chamber to devote more attention to improving the safety of cyclists on the roads and more resources to ensuring there is sufficient infrastructure in place to protect them. If we are serious about protecting cyclists, we must increase the level of Government investment in cycling infrastructure. I cycle around the city and it is a very efficient and environmentally friendly way of travelling around it, but, regrettably, I cannot say it is very safe. The biggest threat to cyclists is posed by the proximity of very large vehicles. To diminish that threat, we must segregate and protect cyclists from large vehicles. Unfortunately, the level of investment by the Government in cycling infrastructure shows that it is not devoted to improving the safety of cyclists. The Minister may or may not be aware that approximately 95,000 people cycle in Dublin each day. I am sure there are very large numbers of cyclists throughout the rest of the country. We know from an answer given by the Minister to my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, that the level of investment in cycling infrastructure has decreased significantly in recent years. The Government spent â¬16.3 million on cycling infrastructure in 2011 and â¬18.8 million in 2015.Regrettably, in 2017, the Minister's first full year in charge of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, only â¬7 million was spent on improving cycling infrastructure. I also know from my colleague, Deputy Troy, that the Minister has announced that this year only â¬8 million will be devoted to cycling infrastructure. It is a derisory amount. It marks a significant decrease in the amount of money Government is spending on cycling infrastructure. If the Government is serious about trying to promote cycling and ensure that cycling is encouraged among our population, it must play its part in trying to make cycling safer. There always will be dangers and threats on the road but it is imperative that the Government tries to ensure that cycling is made safer for citizens who use it. The Minister and his Department should be aiming for 10% of his budget to be spent on cycling and walking facilities. In fact, the United Nations recommends that it should be in the region of 20%. I would like to hear a commitment from the Minister that steps will be made to spend more of the resources of the State on making cycling safer.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	304	I would first like to join Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in expressing my sympathy to the family of Harry Boland, who as he says was the sixth cyclist killed on the roads this year. I thank him for raising this issue, which is a very serious one to which we are paying a great deal of attention, and we acknowledge the need for improvements in this area. My highest priority in all areas of transport is safety. Tragically, many lives are lost on our roads each year, with 55 people killed to date in road traffic incidents in 2018. That figure includes the six cyclists to whom Deputy O'Callaghan referred. We have made a great deal of progress in recent years, and 2017 saw the lowest number of road deaths ever in Ireland at 159. However, no one is complacent about this issue. My Department and I, working in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, the Minister for Justice and Equality, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the local authorities, are continuing to implement measures under the road safety strategy to ensure the number of fatalities and serious injuries on our roads will continue to fall. Cyclists are particularly vulnerable road users, and we are addressing the issue of cyclist safety through a variety of initiatives. The current road safety strategy, which runs from 2013 to 2020, contains measures to promote the use of personal protection equipment and high visibility clothing and developing a standardised road safety cycling proficiency training programme for schools, the Cycle Right programme. Cycle Right was launched in January 2017 and rolled out during the year to as many primary schools as funding allows. Cycling Ireland administers and manages the Cycle Right scheme and maintains a web-based public register of qualified and approved Cycle Right trainers. This new cycle training initiative, which includes an on-road element, will result over time in an increase in the number of children choosing to cycle to and from school safely. The RSA continues to work with cycling groups to promote cycle safety and to produce advertising campaigns aimed at the public, with a particular focus on the need for drivers to take extra care when sharing the road with cyclists. We are also improving our cycling infrastructure. There has been significant investment in this area in recent years, and that is continuing. As part of budget 2018, I secured a significant increase in Exchequer capital funding for cycling infrastructure over the period 2018-2021. Capital investment of more than â¬110 million will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and regional cities over the next four years. Budget 2018 also saw an increase of â¬30 million in the multi-annual allocation for Greenways, bringing the total for 2018 to 2021 to more than â¬55 million. In addition, more than â¬0.75 billion is being invested in reconfiguring the bus network as part of BusConnects, and this will entail construction of new cycling facilities alongside bus routes. Finally, I announced earlier this year that I will bring in new regulations prescribing a minimum passing distance for vehicles overtaking cyclists. As all overtaking offences under road traffic law reside in secondary legislation, my officials have already submitted draft regulations to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for consideration and settling. I understand it has been sent for legal advice. These provisions will assist in improving cycling safety and in changing driver attitudes to cyclists. Taken together, I believe these measures will provide increased safe infrastructure for cyclists and contribute to a change in behaviour which will enhance cycle safety.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	305	I thank the Minister for his response and I agree that cyclists are particularly vulnerable road users. However, what I have not heard from the Minister is a commitment that he and the Government will take steps to improve road safety for cyclists. The Minister mentioned some figures in his answer. Unfortunately, he cannot get away from the fact that infrastructure spend in 2017, which was his first full year as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, was only â¬7 million. It also appears to be the case that in 2018, that spend will be only â¬8 million. That is not sufficient. The Minister and the Government need to give a commitment that they recognise the importance of cycling and that they recognise that it is a form of transport that needs to be encouraged among young people and older people. However, that cannot happen unless people believe their cycle ways and the manner by which they can cycle will be safe. Currently in this city, in other cities and in rural areas it is not safe. The only way it will be made sufficiently safe for more people to use them is if there is delegated and allocated space on the road for cyclists. We do not have that at present and we need to ensure that occurs. It will lead to a huge increase in the number of people who are using cycling if they believe they and their children will be safe when they are out cycling on the roads. I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that he will shortly bring in a statutory instrument giving effect to the minimum passing distance legislation. That is a proposal my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, has been very much to the fore in putting forward. However, that will be of very limited effect unless it is combined with a commitment by Government to ensure there will be cycle paths throughout our cities and rural areas. The Minister should visit cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam. He will see how those progressive cities have devoted huge amounts of resources to facilitating and encouraging cycling. It would be to the benefit of society as a whole but, regrettably, when we have a Government that will not commit investment in the infrastructure we will find ourselves in a situation where people will not feel confident about cycling around the city.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	306	I acknowledge much of what Deputy O'Callaghan said, although I have done quite a lot of it already. I was in Copenhagen recently and observed exactly what he referred to. The progress of cycling in countries like Holland and Denmark is something to which we aspire and admire, and we are a long way behind the achievements in those particular nations. I do not believe it is particularly fair to criticise us for our lack of ambition, achievement, aspiration or declaration. I said in the initial part of my reply that I got a significant increase in Exchequer capital funding for cycling infrastructure over the period from 2018 to 2021. Capital investment of more than â¬110 million, which is a lot of money and is a huge increase, will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and regional cities over the next four years. That is directly targeting safety and improving the infrastructure, which is what Deputy O'Callaghan also referred to as being necessary for safer conditions for cycling. That is exactly what we are doing. In addition to that, the introduction of the minimum passing distance was greeted with a great deal of surprise. It is quite revolutionary. It is extremely unpopular in certain areas but it has been done exclusively for the benefit of cyclists. It is something which has provoked hostility in other areas but it is a recognition of the fact that we must do this, and it will be implemented at the earliest possible time in order to protect cyclists. As the Deputy said, it will not produce a panacea. The Deputy also spoke about the need for advertising. The RSA has embarked on a campaign encouraging the minimum passing distance, MPD, which has had a huge effect on public care in terms of overtaking cyclists before it is even implemented.

The Minister is aware of the issue with Inishmurray Island where the Marine Survey Office under his Department has directed that no licensed craft may land on the island.This is a very serious matter. As the Minister is not personally familiar with Inishmurray island, I will paint a picture for him. Inishmurray island is the Blasket Islands and Skellig Michael rolled into one. It is the site of a monastic settlement founded by Saint Molaise in 520 AD. People have been landing on the island for 1,500 years. In more modern times, 102 residents lived on the island at the turn of the last century. They raised cattle on the island and brought them to the market on the mainland regularly. They also fished there. For the past 30 years, Inishmurray has been a very important aspect of both the Sligo offering and the Irish offering in terms of tourism. Indeed, if Members who live here in the Pale broadened their horizons and thought a little bit more about what we have up there, then maybe "Star Wars" could have been shot on that island. It certainly has scenery that equals Skellig Michael or the Blasket islands. The Marine Survey Office, MSO, has unilaterally taken action which will put boat people out of business and inhibit former islanders - members of the Brady and Herrity families who are still alive - and many hundreds of descendants who have a tradition of visiting every single year. The Minister must work on a cross-departmental basis to get an immediate derogation for landing on Inishmurray island until such time as a permanent solution can be identified and put in place. Even if the Minister was to make the money available today to design and build a new pier or whatever the MSO deems necessary, it would be four years before anyone could set foot on the island. I appeal to the Minister to work with everyone involved to get a derogation on landing on Inishmurray island immediately and then to knock heads together to ensure that a more permanent solution is put in place.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	308	I thank the Minister for dealing with this Topical Issue matter today, which is very serious. Last week the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, attended a meeting in Sligo on the matter of boats landing on Inishmurray. Representatives of FÃ¡ilte Ireland attended, as did boat owners, skippers and families from Inishmurray. Up until 1957 people were living on the island and people have been landing there for hundreds of years. The MSO has done these people a disservice. The monastic site has been mentioned. There is also a graveyard on the island and families go back out to tend the graves of their deceased family members. I understand that it was once more difficult to embark and disembark on Skellig Michael than on Inishmurray. Perhaps if "Star Wars" had visited the latter, we would not be in this situation. We have an obligation to those skippers who have paid up to â¬200,000 for their boats. Why would they risk their boats in terms of landing on the island? They have their own insurance for passengers to embark and disembark at Inishmurray. One of the boat owners had 30 groups scheduled to visit Inishmurray during the summer, but unfortunately, due to the inclement weather, only ten of those scheduled visits took place. Would a disclaimer suffice until such time as the island receives funding for proper landing facilities? We need a common-sense approach to resolving this matter. Sligo is part of the Wild Atlantic Way which is being promoted to tourists. Inishmurray is a major hub in north Sligo and it is vitally important that the Minister would ensure that those in the MSO who made this decision reverse it immediately.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	311	The Marine Survey Office, MSO is the safety regulator for maritime transport in Ireland, and one of its key responsibilities is to ensure the safety of all passengers travelling by boat. In 2008, officials from the MSO carried out an assessment of the landing facilities at Inishmurray island and deemed the recognised landing on the island to be wholly unsuitable for landing passengers. As a consequence, no passenger licences have been issued which include Inishmurray on their plying limits. It was recommended that no such licences be issued until such time as the appropriate landing facility has been provided. No passenger boat licences have been revoked due to this issue and those passenger boats which have the appropriate licences may approach the island so that passengers may see the island and take photographs. It was brought to the attention of the MSO that certain boats were advertising trips to the island and as such may have been operating outside the terms of their passenger boat licences. As safety regulator, the MSO has a responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and officials of the MSO contacted the owners of these vessels to remind them of their obligations. I should make it clear that this issue relates to the issuing of passenger boat licences. A passenger boat is defined in the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 and includes a boat carrying up to 12 passengers for reward or while carrying up to 12 persons to or from their place of work. It would not include persons using a boat by themselves or while carrying friends or family as non-fare paying passengers. Such vessels may be considered to be recreational craft which do not require passenger boat licences but may still be subject to other regulation. The Department recently updated its code of practice on the safe operation of recreational craft. The solution here is simple, namely, the provision of an appropriately safe landing facility. This is a matter for the owner of the property on which the facility would be built and the appropriate local authority, which in this instance is Sligo County Council. I am mindful of the importance of tourism to the local economy in Sligo and elsewhere. That said, passenger safety is a top priority. Once an appropriate landing facility is provided, officials of the MSO will assess it and any passenger vessel proposing to use it with a view to granting the appropriate licence. On the basis of the concerns raised about Inishmurray island, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Griffin, travelled to Sligo last Tuesday, 24 April, to meet locals and listen to their concerns. As a follow-on from this, the Minister of State agreed to facilitate a meeting as a matter of urgency involving agencies that may be able to deliver a solution which would ultimately enable the MSO to reassess the matter. Obviously, as the MSO is the regulator, it would not be appropriate for that office formally to advise on the matter. I hope that such a meeting will chart a course of action to remedy this issue, address the safety concerns and enable tourism to the island to develop. Deputies will be aware of the fact that this proposed meeting will take place very shortly.

The Minister would not be happy if the MSO had any input into Powerscourt, near his home, or the Bog Meadow, which is even closer to his home, and closed amenities, ensuring that owners, not to mention tourists, could not use the facilities. The Department is kicking this out on the never-never. The MSO has been intimidating boat owners, telling them that they will be reported to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and prosecuted. Are there any brains in the Department at all? People have been going to Inishmurray island for 1,500 years. They raised and sold cattle, fished and supplied food to people on the mainland. Is the Minister so bland that he cannot use leadership and common sense to instruct that office to implement a derogation until such time as a solution is found? The Minister exemplifies the fact that Ministers are increasingly like presidents of a golf club. They get to stand in for the photograph but they have no say, nor do they want a say, in terms of directing that to which the people are entitled. This is a disgrace. The Minister should not shirk his responsibilities to the people. I hope that his good colleague, Councillor Casserly, has registered the fact that the Minister is choosing to ignore what Deputies McLoughlin, Scanlon, Kenny and I have been demanding, namely, that he stick his head out of the Pale now and again and give people that to which they are entitled.

There has never been an accident on Inishmurray. I met the boat owners and skippers who confirmed that there has never been an accident involving passengers embarking or disembarking at Inishmurray. The Minister should check the records or the files to see if there is any report of an accident.These skippers are acting responsibly. They have invested significant moneys in the boats. People sitting in an office in Dublin have insulted some of these skippers, for example, by saying they will report them. I ask the Minister to check the facts. I suggest the Marine Survey Office check the embarking and disembarking places on Skellig Michael.

While I acknowledge the difficulties in which people have found themselves, they should be debated in a calmer atmosphere. This is a safety issue, for which there is a remedy. I have spelled it out. Like any responsible politician, I am not prepared to allow people to take risks by bringing fare-paying passengers to places that are deemed to be unsafe, regardless of whether they are islands or tourist spots. The moment it is safe to do so, the relevant authorities will give those involved the go-ahead to resume bringing passengers to the island in order that it can retake its position as a very worthy tourist destination. That is what we are aiming to do. I hope Deputy Marc MacSharry is not annoyed that I mentioned Ms Marie Casserly. She has been presenting the case for Inishmurray in a far more calm and reasoned way than the Deputy has today. I suggest the Deputy would be more effective if he were a little less excitable and a little more reasonable and logical.

The programmes in question covered the issues of gambling and foster care and troubled young people, the latter of which is being raised by five Deputies by way of a Topical Issue. Although I can only talk about my own area, CHO area 2, I can empathise clearly with what the young people on the programme said about child and adolescent mental health services and facilities in general. It is shocking to think that at the end of January, some 6,181 children were waiting for a primary care psychological appointment. Most of the 1,200 high priority cases within that cohort have been waiting for approximately 12 months. I cannot understand why we have to wait for children to become acute before there can be an intervention. Why do we have to wait until they are in sixth class before there is an intervention? Why do we always have to wait until they are nearly on the brink of self-harm before there is an intervention? As we know, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams are not completely filled. While we have the teams, we do not have the full complement of staff. I wonder what the Minister of State and the Department of Health are doing to recruit to fill the teams. To be honest, we do not have a functioning child and adolescent mental health service or functioning child and adolescent mental health teams. When one of the 11 components needed is missing, it can be a key driver that spreads throughout many other services. I wonder how the Minister of State intends to address the issues raised last Thursday night.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	333	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to speak about serious mental health cases among young people. On RTÃ's "The Big Picture - Young and Troubled" broadcast last Thursday we witnessed some heart-rending examples of the distress being experienced by young people with mental health issues and their families as they tried to access child and adolescent mental health services. Unfortunately, the stories we heard from these brave families on RTÃ last Thursday night are reflected across the country. The Government consistently states it is doing all it can, but the facts speak for themselves and I will provide some recent examples. A significant number of children are still being placed in adult units, some for up to six weeks. Some of them have to sleep on chairs or in hallways. At the end of January, over 6,000 children were waiting for a primary care psychology appointment. Over 1,500 of them had been waiting for more than one year. There is a similar situation in child and adolescent mental health services, with over 2,500 children on the waiting list, of whom 351 are on the list for over one year. Barely over half of the number of staff needed to provide a basic child and adolescent mental health service are in place throughout the country. When we engage in early identification and integrated intervention, we can help to reduce significantly the burden of mental ill-health on young people. We do this by identifying symptoms and warning signs at an early stage and, having done so, providing expedient and suitable care. Mental illness is particularly receptive and responsive to early intervention. The mental health system for young people seems to be geared towards triage and crisis intervention. When will the Government provide access to the timely and appropriate early intervention that is desperately needed by young people with mental illnesses?

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, emailed my office the day before last week's programme was aired to tell me that Daniella's mother had requested referrals to Lois Bridges, a private unit in Dublin that offers alternative forms of treatment to those with eating disorders. The girl is skin and bone and very lucky to be still alive. The HSE has advised that there are beds available in the Sliabh Mis unit and wishes to ensure all options within our own services have been explored sufficiently. Unfortunately, our own services have been explored but not successfully because they are not sufficient. My office was contacted yesterday by the mother of a 17 year old girl from County Kerry who had just been released from University Hospital Kerry after trying for a second time to take her own life. Last June, or almost 12 months ago, a request was made for funding to start dialectical behaviour therapy, but it has not yet been approved. The families of these two young girls are on a knife edge. Daniella will not survive unless she receives the proper treatment and I fear for the life of the other girl unless she also receives the proper treatment.

I do not think enough time has been provided to debate this utter travesty and absolute emergency. I compliment RTÃ and, more importantly, those who took part in the documentary. How many more documentaries will we have to watch before the country wakes up? I got angry last week when I was told by one of two witnesses who had to appear without prejudice at the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care that they had been threatened by management for coming here to tell us the truth. We are trying to get to the truth and the root of this issue to stop people from dying. It was reported at the joint committee that 70 schoolgoing kids had died by suicide last year.If it was a school bus full of kids, it would be on the front page of every newspaper in the country. It excludes 16 to 18 year olds not turning up for school who are more vulnerable. There is a crisis in CAMHS and I know that the Minister of State will mention staffing and recruitment, but he will have to come to reality. No matter what must be done, I ask him to sit down with nurses, staff, unions and whoever else to get this right. I am dealing with children aged six, eight, 11 and 13 years and can read what is written on their legs. They are going to doctors who cannot refer them to CAMHS. They are told that they are not sick. A number of weeks ago we had the awful case of young Elisha Gault, of which Members are well aware. I would upset the public if I was to relate what had happened to that young girl before she went for help. The system is failing and we should be absolutely ashamed of ourselves. I am very interested in the Minister of State's reply, but we must do something.

The state of mental health services is very clearly a crisis and an emergency. Last week we saw the RTÃ programme "The Big Picture - Young and Troubled"; it was an excellent piece of public service broadcasting. The matter enters the heart of the public debate every so often, but for the young people affected, in particular, it is an ongoing and daily issue. Day in and day out, they wait for appointments. The Minister of State is aware of the particular interest in this issue in Cork as there has been much concern expressed in the past 12 to 18 months as the suicide rates in the city and county are above the national average in recent years. The Cork and Kerry area accounts for a substantial part of the mental health waiting list, making up 29% of the total. Last year there were approximately 120 people waiting for more than 18 months and that pattern is replicated nationally. There are approximately 250 young people waiting for longer than 12 months for an appointment with CAMHS at this time, which is scandalous. These young people find themselves portrayed as statistics, but the reality is that day after day they go about trying to live fulfilling lives by attending school or work and trying to find satisfaction or hope in life and all the while they wait months for appointments. Some of them could be in crisis. As there are not enough mental health professionals available, they are in the difficult position where they have to try to triage in what is a most severe crisis. As many of the young people who are waiting are in a very severe crisis, mental health professionals must try to establish whose cases are the most urgent. It is a fish and loaves job, as there are not enough professionals to go around. Young people are suffering as a consequence.

Overall, the programme adopted a balanced approach, showing both the positive and negative aspects of the system. It referenced the increasing demands, good practice and the service improvements required. I stressed on the programme that youth mental health had to be viewed in its widest sense and seen as more than just the specialist CAMHS. A priority for the Government is improving all aspects of prevention and early intervention, including progressing implementation of the 2017 report of the national youth mental health task force. Our aim is to improve access to services by examining options such as seven-day cover, 24-hour cover, developing a national telephone and text helpline and other digital information and supports, as access to early intervention and the signposting to services clearly need improvement for service users. Mental health remains a priority for the Government. This is reflected by the additional â¬35 million we gave in the last budget, bringing total HSE funding in the area to over â¬910 million. The HSE service plan for 2018 is developing CAMHS against a background where the population of children is growing and the demand for CAMHS saw a 26% increase between 2012 and 2017. Approximately 18,800 referrals are expected to CAMHS this year, with approximately 14,300 being seen by this specialist service. A particular issue that came through strongly on the RTÃ programme was that of service variation around the country, particularly in accessing services, addressing urgent cases and tackling waiting lists. The HSE launched a standard operating procedure in 2015 for both inpatient and community CAMHS. The executive is reviewing its operational procedure and this review is expected to be completed by mid-year. We expect it to reinforce the message that services must be delivered equitably across the country. Other CAMHS-specific measures included in the HSE service plan for 2018 include increasing the number of CAMHS referrals to be seen this year by 27% compared to the number in 2017. The measures will also seek to provide a seven-day per week service for CAMHS to ensure supports for young people in line with Connecting for Life. They will also improve day hospital services within CAMHS and develop eating disorder specialist community teams for young people, with a range of "talking therapies" such as dialectical behaviour therapy. The executive is also enhancing access by older adolescents to specialist mental health services, with continued appropriate placement and care in CAMHS-specific settings. There have been widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, while recruitment efforts have been ongoing, notwithstanding a serious shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS consultants at both national and European level. A key approach to reducing pressures on CAMHS is the decision by the Government to increase access to counselling services in HSE primary care services. The recent appointment of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists will go some way towards developing such a service for teenagers and young people. The genuine and serious issues raised on the recent RTÃ programme will receive full and proper consideration by the Department of Health and the HSE in the context of our collective efforts to improve all aspects of mental health services for young people.

Only a number of weeks ago in Galway the Youth Work Ireland counselling service applied for funding from the HSE to provide a service for 220 children, ranging in age from 16 to 21 years, but its request was turned down. It was only awarded â¬15,000. The service was to provide support for an entire county - the second biggest in Ireland - but seemingly it did not meet the needs threshold. The needs had been identified by teachers, schools and Tusla as being met by this very good and working early intervention group. I cannot understand how, with an extra allocation of funding, we are not reaching out to groups such as this which have a proven record and good statistics.

That probably sums up the experience of many young people and their families in trying to access mental health services. The second interim report of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care was published last week and one of the most notable aspects was that â¬400 million was being spent on psychotropic drugs but only â¬10 million was being spent on counselling in primary care settings. That goes to part of the problem to which I alluded in that we seem to triage and deal with crisis interventions instead of dealing with people when they first show early signs of having a mental illness or difficulty. The HSE launched a standard operating procedure in 2015, but it is ineffective when there are not enough staff in place to operate or implement it. Everything is being funnelled into CAMHS and GPs are in a desperate position because they either send people to emergency departments or must prescribe drugs for them. We must provide for earlier intervention and more primary care supports for young people.

Last year, in an independent survey of parents who accessed CAMHS, only 18% of the respondents were satisfied with it overall. Of 177 respondents, only 23 were willing to recommend the services. Only 32% of respondents felt that the service was beneficial to their child. This is not a reflection on the dedicated and committed staff. The problem is a lack of resources. The Minister of State said he intends to employ more people in that service. It is not just a sticking plaster approach that is needed. A fundamental root-and-branch approach is needed to ensure we have the services needed and that they deal with the mental health budget. The services are inadequate. Unless that is addressed in a fundamental and progressive way, we will have the same problems again.

We know that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, sees this and he is trying to do his best. I ask him to use his and the Government's power to try to solve this. No amount of money is too much to ensure that services can finally be put in place. It is more than 12 years since A Vision for Change. As I mentioned, 70 schoolchildren died last year. How many have attempted to take their lives? How many have self-harmed or abused drugs or alcohol? We do not know. We surely cannot allow this to continue. It is a national emergency. These are children. They are people's sisters, brothers, mothers and fathers. We said all this before. On the future of mental health care, I ask the Minister of State to listen to the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care. Listen to our proposals, talk to the unions and please make the changes that we need so that we can get this right. I do not care what it takes. Prevention is better than cure. I appeal to the Minister of State to take everything on board.

There is a lot of discussion about prevention, and rightly so. It is vitally important to resolve this crisis and prevention has to be at the fore. It is going to take many years to build this system properly. There will be prevention in schools and in the wider community. That is going to take some time to work through the system. Meanwhile, we have people in crisis and people who require urgent healthcare. Sometimes a distinction is drawn between physical health and mental health that is not helpful. These are people who are often in bad health and require urgent attention. Often, they are not able to get it, not because the staff are not up to it but because they are overstretched. They need much more support. A Vision for Change is 12 years old. We have only two thirds of the staffing level or a little more than that. That badly needs to be addressed to ensure people get the service they deserve.

I know the sincerity every Deputy raising this issue brings to the table. It is not just today that I have seen that. I have a few responses. On the Youth Work Ireland counselling service in Galway, I have undertaken to look at that for Deputy Rabbitte. There are issues with governance etc. in respect of some organisations that have received money. While I am not suggesting for a second that Youth Work Ireland is involved, the Deputy will appreciate that I can not give her detail now, but I will talk to her again. We continue to try to fill staff vacancies and to build training. There have been a number of people coming in. The 114 assistant psychologists that have been taken on in primary care will make a big impact. They are supported by 20 full-time psychologists. That will be another level underneath CAMHS. That has been badly needed for years. That is the biggest help we can give to deal with the lists and the numbers that are piling in at the top of the CAMHS list. On intervention, I appreciate what Deputy Ã Laoghaire is saying about not neglecting the upper level of the pyramid. We will continue to keep resources there. Deputy Ferris mentioned individual cases. He will appreciate I cannot go over those. Deputy Buckley spoke of 70 children. As I understand it, the CSO would dispute that number.

It is neither here nor there. If one child died by suicide, that is one child too many. I am not going to argue the toss over the numbers. People have a responsibility when they supply information to ensure that it is accurate. I am not suggesting the Deputy in this regard but the people who came before the committee. People know my views on the CAMHS system and what we need to do. I refer to early intervention and rolling out things like the STEPS programme in schools and ensuring we have a more proactive system rather than one that is reactive. For too long too much of it was management. That was highlighted by that show. Different CAMHS teams operated very differently and had much longer waiting lists despite having a similar number of referrals to other CAMHS teams that had no waiting lists. We have challenges within the management of these systems that we have to look at. I reiterate that we take it very seriously.

I wish to share as much information as I can and that I have, and to set out the actions I have taken. I again recognise the contribution of Vicky Phelan in bringing this matter to our attention. I thank her and her family. I especially thank her for her support for screening programmes. I recognise that across the House, while raising their legitimate concerns, colleagues have also endorsed that message about the importance of the screening programme. I thank everybody for that also. I hope we can try to work together collectively to identify any shortcomings in our screening programmes and learn from them to make sure that our screening services are improved. I look forward to hearing the contribution of Deputies across the House. I have to inform the House of some emerging information that I have received this evening from the serious incident management team, SIMT, that has been sent into CervicalCheck.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	355	While I had been advised, and it had been commonly understood, that the CervicalCheck clinical audit covered all cases notified to the national cancer registry, I have been informed this afternoon that this is not the case. While CervicalCheck has audited all cases notified to it, I have been informed that a potentially considerable number of cases will not have been subjected to an audit of their screening history. These are not new cases of cancer, nor is it a group of women wondering if they have cancer. These are women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and treated as such but their cases have not been included in a clinical audit. Having identified this issue, the SIMT will take steps to identify any additional cases of cervical cancer that occurred during this period and which were not audited. The screening history of these additional cases will be established, and if any of these women were screened through the CervicalCheck programme, their case will be reviewed in further detail with cytology review where necessary. This is an evolving situation but I am giving as much information to this House as I have as soon as I have it to be transparent with the DÃ¡il. We are all here, I think we can agree, because Vicky Phelan spoke out. I recognise that to do so cannot have been easy for her or her family. Her courage and tenacity has done a great service to the women of Ireland and her actions will ultimately lead to improvements for all. I think the background to the case is well understood at this point, but I want to be very clear about my own level of knowledge prior to the case becoming public and with regard to the information note I received on 16 April, which I have published today with only personal information redacted. I was not notified at that time of the information which later became available, information such as the correspondence chain between doctors and the clinical director of the programme.The full implications became clear to me only on Wednesday, 25 April, when Vicky Phelan spoke, and on Thursday, 26 April, at which point I acted swiftly. The note outlined the details of an individual case. lt informed me of a legal process that was already underway. It informed me that mediation discussions had been held on 9 April and pre-trial discussions had been held with a judge on 10 and 12 April. It said that the matter may progress to the High Court on 19 April but that the case was likely to be settled before going to court. It said that the claim against the HSE was likely to be dropped in the absence of any bad faith by the HSE. It informed me that my Department had been advised by the National Cancer Control Programme that it did not consider this to be a patient safety incident. It informed me the National Screening Service had assured the Department that no quality issues have arisen in respect of the UK laboratory that performed the 2011 test referred to in the case. In an appendix with background information, the note outlined the clinical cancer audit process, including the fact that all current and historical clinical cancer audits had been communicated to treating clinicians in 2016 and that more recently women are informed of this audit process and have the option to request information on the outcomes of these reviews. It was not clear until after the details of this case became public that this process was not ensuring women were informed. Once I became aware of that I ordered immediate change, as is well documented. Since 2008, a total of 3 million smear tests have been carried out by CervicalCheck. The cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test; it is a screening test. It is a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions and to identify women who require further investigation or follow-up. Tests can produce false positive and false negative results. Women are screened at three-yearly intervals but cervical cancer may develop in the interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme. It is a fact that the current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test that produces a not insignificant number of false negative results. I can, however, confirm that primary human papillomavirus screening will be introduced later this year. I took that decision in February and it will be introduced by October. I understand that the accuracy of HPV testing is significantly higher than liquid-based cytology testing, which is the testing used now. HPV testing is expected to result in fewer women receiving a false negative result. I am also of the view that testing for the HPV virus will be a more appropriate strategy for the cohort of women who have received vaccination against HPV. My decision to approve primary HPV screening was informed by a HIQA health technology assessment. The assessment found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests for most women. The HSE has advised that 1,482 cervical cancer cases have been audited by CervicalCheck covering the period from 2008 to 2018. The audit found that the majority of these cases involved patients who already had been referred for further investigation or treatment by CervicalCheck. In the case of 208 patients who were the subject of a detailed cytology review it found that the review differed from the original test. Last Friday, the HSE established a serious incident management team. The team worked through the weekend to confirm the number of women involved and the extent to which the audit results had been communicated to them. Yesterday, it was reported to me that 162 of the 208 women involved had not been informed of the outcome of the audit process. Over the past two days we have been communicating with these women and I believe significant progress has now been made. Obviously, there will be a small number of cases where we might not succeed in initially making contact, such as a case where a woman may have moved abroad. Like all Deputies, I was very sorry to learn that 17 of the patients involved have since died and I would like to sincerely express my sympathies to their families on the record of the House. Obviously, as yet we do not know the cause of death of these individual women but we will work with the families to ensure that is established. A helpline has been in operation since Friday and appropriate clinical staff will follow up on specific clinical questions. Between Friday and the close of business yesterday, approximately 6,000 calls were received. Unfortunately, there were some technical issues with the telephone line but I am informed that the HSE had worked to address this. I am conscious that some women will be worried that they might have received an incorrect smear result and they might want a further test to be reassured. I have heard many women say that in recent days. This was one of the most persistent issues that came in through the helpline we established. I have, therefore, asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test and whose general practitioner considers that the woman should have a further test to access such a further test without charge. These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week. I wish to thank the doctor representative organisations for their co-operation and support in this matter. Vicky Phelan's case has highlighted a number of major weaknesses in how people experience our health service. I believe that immediate actions are required to address these weaknesses and to provide assurance to the public with regard to the quality and performance of the cervical screening programme. Given the gravity of the situation as well as the impact it has had on Vicky Phelan and a number of other women, I think it is vital that we ensure we put in place a process to allow all of us - patients, doctors and policymakers alike - to understand exactly what happened and what steps we need to rectify the situation. I have, therefore, directed HIQA to commence a statutory investigation to examine the clinical and managerial governance of CervicalCheck. This investigation will place a particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients. It is crucial for all of us to get this information. A statutorily empowered investigation by HIQA, the body established by these Houses for this very purpose, is the most appropriate way forward in this instance. As part of this investigation an international peer review group will be established to examine our cervical screening programme against international best practice and standards. HIQA has been asked to identify any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes. This will ensure that any learning will have wider impact and serve to improve all our screening programmes. I am conscious, while looking at a programme and how to improve it, that individual women have been impacted and we need to ensure they can get independent clinical answers. I have now decided to appoint an international expert clinical panel to provide all women concerned with an individual clinical review. A liaison nurse specialist will be appointed to ensure the women involved receive all the support they require. I met the Irish Cancer Society this afternoon to ask that the society would meet the panel and ensure the panel and the relevant processes are put in place in a way that is supportive of women patients as well as to ensure women get the answers they need. The work of the expert panel will be completed as soon as possible. I hope it will have its work concluded by July. Since 2008, CervicalCheck has undertaken tendering processes to award contracts for cytology testing of cervical smear tests. In 2013, the national cytopathology training centre at the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital was engaged to carry out some of the laboratory tests. Currently, the testing of cervical smear tests is carried out by three institutions with approximately 50% of the testing done in Ireland and the remaining 50% done abroad. I realise this has been the source of much public discussion in recent days. I have been assured that all three laboratories meet quality assurance standards and are certified by the relevant national authorities. However, the introduction of HPV testing later this year as the primary screening mechanism for CervicalCheck, with cytology as reflex test, will involve a reconfiguration of laboratory work. It will also provide an opportunity for further tendering processes to be undertaken for any laboratory work carried out outside the public sector. This issue in recent days has shone a real spotlight on our open disclosure practices or lack thereof in some cases. Of course open disclosure involves an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. It is a human experience for all involved and one that should not be hindered by other concerns and fears. The HSE open disclosure policy has been in place since 2013 and the HSE committed to its full implementation in the HSE service plan this year. The Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners sets outs the duties of medical doctors in respect of open disclosure and duty of candour. It states that patients and their families, where appropriate, are entitled to honest, open and prompt communication about adverse events that may have caused them harm. When discussing events with patients and their families, doctors should acknowledge that the event happened and explain how it happened; apologise, if appropriate; and assure patients and their families that the cause of the event will be investigated and efforts made to reduce the chance of it happening again. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 includes provisions for open disclosure of serious events including certain protections for information given to the patient at an open disclosure meeting. This approach creates a safe space for healthcare staff to be open and transparent with patients, who can be given as much information as possible as early as possible, including an apology. In the course of DÃ¡il consideration of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, I gave a commitment to bring forward separate legislation to provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious events. I wish to acknowledge the work of Deputy Clare Daly in this regard. I intend to bring a memorandum to Government next week proposing a patient safety Bill. This Bill will include measures to support patient safety objectives and to provide for mandatory open disclosure to patients of those serious events which will be the subject of mandatory external notification. I will prescribe a list of reportable events that are required to be notified by public and private providers and this will include screening. There has been much criticism about the way the State handled Vicky Phelan's legal proceedings. I accept that criticism. I think there is a difficulty with our tort laws in that they are slow to provide for persons who have suffered harm within the health care system. However, the State Claims Agency is delegated to manage all claims against the State and neither I nor my Department has any role or function in this regard. There also have been calls for greater accountability across the health system. For my own part, I am clear that accountability and good governance are central to the organisation and functioning of the health system. I have called it out in recent days where I did not see that come to the fore. As part of my Department's response to SlÃ¡intecare, it is proposed to examine how best to strengthen accountability in our health care system. Other jurisdictions have managed to do this, therefore, why can Ireland not? Steps will be identified to consider how accountability for all staff across the health service can be strengthened. My Department also expects to publish a new code of conduct for health and social care providers this month. This will be an important driver in the delivery of the patient safety agenda, both in terms of policy and service delivery. The code will apply to all service providers and individuals who come into contact with a user of health or social services.  I want to assure this House and, more importantly, the women of Ireland that I am taking every possible action to ensure that an incident such as this does not happen again. I acknowledge the very difficult circumstances that Vicky Phelan and her family are now in, and I would like to thank her for her bravery in bringing this to light. I still think it is bizarre that doctors had information in relation to patients that they did not share with their patients. That paternalistic attitude is something that should concern us all. In all of this debate, however, it is important we do not lose sight of the fact that many cancer screening programmes have resulted in the lives of many women being saved. We must do all we can to ensure women continue to attend for smear testing. We acknowledge things went wrong but we are determined to put things right. I hope the actions I have outlined will help in that regard. Tomorrow the Joint Committee on Health with meet relevant officials from the HSE, CervicalCheck, the National Cancer Control Programme and my Department. I expect all those agencies to be upfront and forthwith and I do not expect a commencement of any investigation to stop that exchange of legitimate democratic debate here in our Parliament.  This evening I will continue to do what I have done since this incident came into the public domain and since I have known all about it, which is to be as transparent and open as I can, and I hope to work constructively with colleagues across this House to put this right.

What we have seen so far in the case of CervicalCheck is nothing short of an outrage. It constitutes a fundamental breach of trust between patients, their doctors and the HSE and it has led to widespread fear and anger across Ireland in the past few days, and I will speak to that shortly. Before I do so, I want to commend the bravery and determination of Vicky Phelan and of her family. If Ms Phelan had not made the stand she did, what has happened in CervicalCheck would remain a secret. Ms Phelanâs lawyer has said that "enormous efforts and energies were put into forcing her to remain silent". If Ms. Phelan had not faced down those efforts, what has happened in CervicalCheck would remain a secret. Ms Phelanâs courage has laid bare a conspiracy of silence. Her courage has ensured legislation on mandatory disclosure will be introduced. It has ensured that many other women, also kept in the dark, will now be told the truth. It has prompted Government to fast-track patient safety legislation. It has led to an investigation being launched to see what was going on in CervicalCheck and to see if similar withholding of patient information is happening in other screening programmes. For all of these reasons, and more, Ms Phelanâs courage will lead to important changes in health care in Ireland, which I believe everyone in this House will support. The focus this week must be on the 162 women who, like Vicky Phelan, were not told of screening errors. It is imperative that all these women are engaged with quickly, and are provided with the support they need. In the 17 cases where women are now deceased, their families must be met similarly. The establishment of an investigation is also essential, and the Governmentâs announcement on this is welcome. As answers are required quickly, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, seems to be a reasonable choice to lead the investigation, at least in the first instance. However, HIQAâs focus is clinical quality, and this investigation must be broader than that. At the core of this issue is the withholding of patient information, and Fianna FÃ¡il will support this investigation only if the Government can provide an assurance that this will be covered. Specifically, HIQA must be able to investigate the question of who decided what, and who knew what in CervicalCheck and in the broader HSE. The investigation must not be used by the Government to avoid answering questions in the short term. There is very considerable public worry, and it is essential that information continues to be made available, including while the investigation is carried out. There are many other questions that need to be investigated. Why did it take two years for the HSE to inform Ms Phelanâs consultant, Dr. Hickey, of the false negative? The HSE has a policy of open disclosure. Why then was the HSE telling doctors to use their judgment as to whether they should openly disclose, and in the cases of the deceased, why was the HSE saying that the doctors should simply make a note on their files? Why did Ms Phelanâs consultant not share the information about the screening error with her until the year after he found out about it? When senior managers within the HSE were informed of the disagreement between Ms Phelanâs consultant and CervicalCheck, why did senior management within the HSE not act to ensure all patients were told? Why did the HSE adopt such an aggressive legal position in the proceedings brought by Ms Phelan? Why was the HSE agreeable to a confidentiality clause? Does this not run entirely contrary to a culture of open disclosure? How are we meant to learn how to make things better in health care if agreements like this are met hand-in-hand with gagging orders?  There are important questions to be answered too regarding the Department and the Government. When did the Department become aware of Ms Phelanâs case? Was the Department aware that it took three years for Vicky Phelan to find out about the screening errors and that these had been kept from her? Was the Department aware, or did it suspect, that this practice was more widespread than the individual case? Why did it take so long for the Department to prepare a note on the case for the Minister?  There are also questions for the Minister to answer, following on from the note he gave today, and I acknowledge he has made that note available. Did the Minister make any follow-up inquiries of his officials based on the content of the note? That is one of the key questions we want to understand. The note states that the case was being taken for two reasons, the first is the error in the 2011 screening, which is the responsibility of the US laboratory. The second reason was the non-disclosure of the error, which is the responsibility of the HSE. Did the Minister ask why this non-disclosure happened? Did he ask how many other screening errors there might be? Did he ask how many other non-disclosures there might be? The note also states, "The State Claims Agency is of the view that publicity around the case and/or settlement is likely." Should this not have prompted further questions and earlier action? The Minister did act when he found out about the scale of the issue last Thursday, but if these questions had been asked of officials when the Minister was given the note, they would have alerted him to the wider issue, which would in turn have led to quicker action from the Minister and the Government and avoided several very difficult days of concern in this country and avoided a lot of fear and a lot of confusion. A further question is whether the Minister could or, to be fair to him, should, have intervened to stop the court case. I would like to quote Ms Phelanâs lawyer who said the following: The entire court process could have been avoided. We have heard Minister Harris confirm that he was made aware through an information note on this case on the 16th of April. That's three days before the trial began.  While he said ... that the one time a minister cannot intervene is during a court case. If that is so, there wasn't a court case at that time. There was nothing preventing him from asking further questions or directing those through the State Claims Agency or through the Department of Health to prevent steps being taken to force Vicky Phelan into court. That is a question that Vicky Phelan's solicitor has asked. Vicky Phelan describes what has happened to her as "an appalling breach of trust". Many people across Ireland feel the same way. I have been approached by constituents. I imagine all Members have. People are scared. People are furious that this has happened. That an error in diagnosis or in screening would have been spotted, that the State would have waited two full years to let anybody know of that error and that one's own doctor would then have engaged in correspondence with the State as to who should tell the patient is simply outrageous. The danger is that this appalling breach of trust leads to a lack of confidence in screening, and that cannot happen. The screening programme introduced in 2008 has saved many lives. I talked to a consultant last night who told me that he reckons 400 to 500 women's lives are saved every year thanks to the cervical screening programme, but if we are to maintain confidence and if we are to rebuild trust, then many serious changes are need. Mandatory disclosure must be brought in quickly. It should be in by now but it is not. We must move to a culture of transparency. The default option of the State seeking gagging orders where it settles with patients must be reviewed otherwise how else will we learn from the mistakes that are made. Critically, a way must be found for the public to seek justice that does not incur such high legal fees that one could lose one's house. We all know how this works. Somebody goes to a solicitor and gets a legal team. He or she potentially incurs very serious upfront costs. We know how the State responds. The State walks in with an army of lawyers. The State walks in with senior counsel and junior counsel, solicitors and experts and it is the individual citizen against the State. That fear and threat of legal costs is used as a weapon against people in this State and it is an effective weapon. Ms Phelan could have been excused for not risking all of that in dealing with everything that she did. She decided to fight. She decided to put everything on the line. It is incumbent on us all to make sure that we take some serious steps on what will be a long and tough journey to ensuring that confidence and trust is rebuilt and that we begin to have an era of transparency and genuine openness in this country when it comes to people's health.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	358	At the outset, I commend the bravery of Ms Vicky Phelan. Without her determination and fight, this scandal probably would never have come to light and those affected and their families may never have known the truth. Truth, compassion, and honesty should be evident at all levels of our health service, and even more so at the higher institutional levels of our screening programmes, our hospitals, and the HSE. Nobody is saying for a moment that a health service can be run without human error but when a mistake is made, there should be an apology and the relevant parties must be informed. The reality could not have been more different for Ms Phelan and those women affected by misdiagnosis or, indeed, for the potential considerable number of cases only notified to us this evening. The scale of the problem is still not known. That is outrageous. There are women who are watching this who are very concerned. There are women who are watching us this evening who are not aware of their own medical records. That is outrageous. When we look at what has happened, we see the response of the State was to fight a terminally ill woman and her family, to force her to give evidence in a courtroom, to talk about her personal life, her health and her sex life in a room full of strangers. It was then to try to force that same woman into a confidentiality agreement so that she could not speak about what had happened. That was the response of the State. The response was for CervicalCheck to tell doctors treating women to exercise their judgment on whether to tell them about the misdiagnosis and to "simply ensure the result is recorded" if any of the women affected by this had died in the meantime. It should not be at the whim of a doctor to exercise judgment in whether to inform a woman where her health is at risk, and even more so in the incidence of a misdiagnosis. We have the right to know. Where we should have truth, compassion and honesty, we had malice, vindictiveness and dishonesty. How did the scope for this dishonesty materialise? Why is it not mandatory for the health service to disclose errors and to always tell the truth? We saw it in this House on 8 November 2017. On a vote on Report Stage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017, the Government, in concert with Fianna FÃ¡il, which abstained, voted through amendment No. 31 which ensured that the process for open disclosure would be voluntary and not mandatory. I welcome yet another U-turn on this issue and I hope that we will now see mandatory reporting - voluntary reporting is simply not good enough. We in Sinn FÃ©in opposed making it voluntary. We voted to make it mandatory but we lost. A year earlier in a Joint Committee on Health debate on open disclosure, I argued forcefully for mandatory open disclosure. Indeed, I argued for it again on Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on 21 February last in light of the case of Ms Alison McCormack, who had a breast cancer misdiagnosis. The practice of keeping quiet when things go wrong is often prevalent in our medical culture and only a statutory duty of candour will address the situation. I welcome that the need for mandatory open disclosure with legislative underpinning is now accepted right across this House but it should not take a scandal to achieve this. The gendered nature of this scandal is not lost on me, my friends, my daughter, my mother or any of the women who are affected by this. In fact, many women who contacted me have said they are not surprised at the failures of the health service and the State as regards how it treats women. The Minister described it as "bizarre". No woman who has spoken to me about it has described it as bizarre. Unfortunately, it seems to be par for the course. We are not surprised at the gendered nature of this. Three times in the past six months I have taken Leaders' Questions and raised significant issues which solely affect women. In November last, I raised the issue of the drug Epilim and the side effects for children born to women who took the drug while pregnant. In January, I raised the transvaginal mesh scandal, and in February, I raised the case of misdiagnosis of breast cancer. Men often talk about historic injustices perpetrated against women in this State but when we women talk about it, we talk in terms of the present day. This scandal reinforces for women why we should be afraid of the gendered nature of our health service and how the State treats us. The outsourcing of women's healthcare through testing of smears in the United States was warned against in 2008. Concerns were raised at that time by Dr. David Gibbons, the chair of the cytology-histology group within the quality assurance committee of the National Cervical Screening Programme. I want to know whether complaints were made at that time to HIQA and how HIQA responded to those complaints because when we know that we will be able to judge whether HIQA is, indeed, the correct authority to undertake this investigation. The then CEO of the National Cancer Screening Service, the outgoing head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, insisted that it would be possible for doctors to talk to the person who analysed the smear test in the United States through teleconferencing. There is no evidence that this happened and the Minister might be able confirm that for us. The then Sinn FÃ©in health spokesperson, Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in, criticised the 2008 decision of the Fianna FÃ¡il-led Government to outsource the screening service during a DÃ¡il debate, stating: "The Minister for Health and Children would rather listen to corporate executives in the private health business". The Deputy went on to state that the "HSE has awarded the contract for cervical cancer tests to Quest Diagnostics, a US company that has an unacceptably high rate of errors and has been convicted of fraud." Deputy Ã CaolÃ¡in has been proved right and the issue of outsourcing must be incorporated into any investigation. The Minister must explain to this House if any concerns were raised with the Department of Health over the past ten years regarding the outsourcing of these tests and if any internal concerns were raised about the efficacy of the tests. Were any audits carried out on the companies concerned and does Clinical Pathology Laboratories still hold a contract with the State for smear tests or any other screening or diagnostic work?The Minister says he became aware of Ms Phelanâs case on 17 April. Was he aware of the audits from 2014 and subsequent analysis of the misdiagnosis which was continuing since 2017? Tony OâBrien has said he only found out about the issue when he heard of Vicky Phelanâs case from the media. I find it hard to believe the Minister only found out on 17 April but it is even harder to believe that Mr. OâBrien found out from the media. I do not see it as plausible. The State was being sued for a substantial sum of money. Surely the nature of the case and the cost involved would have sent alarm bells through the HSE, the Department of Health and up to the level of Government.  The Minister articulated his lack of confidence in the leadership of CervicalCheck last week. It will be interesting to ascertain his confidence in Mr. OâBrien and in his role in this scandal. Maybe it is the case that their fortunes are inextricably intertwined and it might account for his reluctance to relieve him of his duties. The general public would also welcome a statement from Eunice O'Raw, general counsel for the HSE, on the decision of the HSE to fight the case of Vicky Phelan and on what information was provided to Ms OâRaw regarding the case by the HSE and what information she provided to the HSE and the Minister. The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and the Government against women who have been wronged by this State is now in full public view. It is a disgrace that the State, the Government and the HSE consistently behave the way they do when such cases arise. It is unacceptable that agents of the State pursue victims of their failures and do so in such an aggressive manner. They behave this way because they take their cue from Government. The Minister must ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Vicky Phelan and others have been made to do. I will finish by saying that in the course of my work before I was elected, I had occasion to represent people who were engaged in a dispute with the HSE. I have seen how vicious and aggressive it is when it pursues people. I have seen people's lives destroyed by the HSE, some by virtue of the fact they were whistleblowers and others by virtue of the fact that they found themselves on the wrong side of a reported incident and of which they were subsequently found innocent. I have seen what the HSE and the machinery of the State is like when it goes up against an individual. For that reason, I commend Vicky Phelan on what she has done. She should not have had to do it. Nobody believes the health service can be run without error or risk but they demand that it will show compassion and be truthful and honest. That is not what has happened to date. The people deserve better than this. Vicky Phelan deserves better than this. The victims of misdiagnosis deserve better than this. Not only do the women of the State deserve better, but we demand better than this. I hope for the Minister's sake that he has the answers the women of Ireland seek this evening.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	359	Here we go again - Magdalen laundries, hepatitis C, Brigid McCole, Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, a neighbour of mine, Amanda Mellet, who I brought to meet the Minister, and now Vicky Phelan. We have a real problem in this country protecting women's health. This issue is on the Minister's watch. He needs to do the right thing. I join with thanking Vicky for her openness and for the way she has put herself in the public spotlight. I am sure she is watching me speak now and is listening to all of us. She has put herself in a very difficult situation out in the open and she is doing it for the betterment of women across Ireland. We need to stand with her and deal with this issue on her behalf because of the bravery she has shown. The most important thing we need to deal with is the 208 affected women. They need our protection and support, our endeavours and a health system that will support them. Of the 208, 46 have been told, two of whom have passed away, and 162 are in the process of being told, 15 of whom have unfortunately passed away. We need to deal with the bombshell the Minister has just landed tonight, which I was not prepared for. We need to know the number of cases that have not been audited. The Minister has not told us in his speech. It is a bombshell. What number of women have not had their cases audited? Are they recent? Here is the real issue. If they are not recent, what was the basis for not selecting them in the first place from the national cancer register? We will be having questions later, but these are fairly obvious questions and worrying times. This is a very live issue for the people and the women of Ireland. I hope the Minister will be able to answer that in detail because it is concerning. If the Minister has that detail, he has not given it to the House. The shake of his head indicates he does not have it. We cannot get near the detail of this without that information. We all have a duty to ensure there is public confidence in the screening process for cervical cancer and in the other screening processes. It is a duty we should all honour. The screening process along with the HPV vaccine, which our party has pushed, are essential to prevent women getting cancers throughout their lives. We all have a duty to ensure that confidence is maintained in these. I met with officials from the Minister's Department for an hour and 20 minutes recently. What did his Department know about the issue? What did it know about similar cases? I accept what the Minister is saying, that he did not find out until 16 April. Was no human being in the Department of Health aware of this case or any similar case or issue preceding that? It is an answer the Minister will have to give. The words that jump out of the memo are: "The SCA is of the view that publicity around the case ... is likely." I do not think this memo would have ever seen the light of day only for the potential publicity that would surround it which we all know now is causing serious issues and worry for women across Ireland. It says a lot to me about the Department of Health. It says a lot to me about the political culture. It says a lot to me about the way in which we administer health in the country that this note was justified on the basis of the potential publicity. The NCCP has an awful lot of questions to answer. In the briefing note, it says that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident, which it is not credible. It is not acceptable and it is deeply worrying. That it would put in the memo to Government is far more worrying than the clinical director resigning. I took the trouble this evening to look up the governance of CervicalCheck. We all know about the resignation of the clinical director. She reported to the head of screening, an assistant national director. What is his role in this? Where is the accountability? The people are sick to their back teeth of the lack of accountability. He reports to the national director of the national cancer control programme. What was his role in this and did he have knowledge of it?Who reports to the recently appointed chief clinical officer who reports to the director general who we now know found out from RTÃ? Does it not say a lot that the Minister knew about this issue before the director general of the HSE did? There has to be accountability for all of the layers. I know that this lady resigned after the Minister had expressed no confidence, but does he have confidence in the structure, in the people in it, or was it just because of weak media performances somebody had to be chosen to go under a bus? The investigation cannot be led by HIQA. With respect, I completely disagree with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly. If the Minister goes down this route, he will end up with a commission of investigation. This is a national scandal and, for many reasons, HIQA is not the organisation to carry out the investigation. It has powers to investigate, take documents, go into organisations and seize computers, etc. but under the legislation, it only has limited powers to do so in certain circumstances. It has no powers whatsoever to compel the attendance of witnesses, direct a witness to answer questions or take sworn evidence. Witnesses are given no immunity in giving their evidence. Given what we now know about medical candour and the profession, does the Minister honestly think that unless the witnesses have to do so, they will give all of the information needed? HIQA will not have the capacity to cross-examine personnel, which will mean that in many cases the evidence given will not be able to used in the making of findings. I guarantee, for all of these reasons, that if the Minister, with Fianna FÃ¡il, pushes this through, we will be back in this House looking for a commission of inquiry because the public will demand it. I ask the Minister to, please, listen to me, measure this appropriately and do the right thing because we will soon be back debating this issue. HIQA does not have the powers to deliver. I do not believe it even has the capacity or the resources to do so, even it is the right authority. The Minister needs to change his mind in that regard.  We need to act quickly. General practitioners, GPs, have not been given guidance on what to tell people. We need to ensure the women of Ireland know where to go with their concerns and that when they go to GPs or other medical professionals, there will be a structure in place such that their concerns will be addressed. We also need a guarantee that resources will be available to deal with far more inquiries which will be needed and that all those being screened will have their problems addressed, too. The Minister needs to give a guarantee to the House that all of this is in place and that everyone will have the information they require.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	360	On behalf of People before Profit, I salute Vicky Phelan, a national hero, and wish her the very best of solidarity in the struggle she faces so bravely. We know some details of what happened, but we do not know enough. The Minister is conducting an investigation, etc. but the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine has asked him to publish the results of the 2014 audit. When will that happen? It is very important to know.  We know that what happened in 2014 was the result of a policy decision and its consequences were debated and well known in 2008. I am sure all Members have read the Official Report of the debate at the time. There were very articulate cases made to the then Minister, Mary Harney, and the Fianna FÃ¡il-Green Party Government against putting the service out to tender. It did not have to be tendered for. She said it had been put out to tender "for reasons of transparency, fairness and equity to make sure it got the best quality assured service" and that "80% of points were allotted for quality and turnaround time and 20% for price". We had a political choice in 2008 to invest in several laboratories based in Irish hospitals, using Irish experts and training new scientists in the Irish public service. As in many other cases, however, where we justify privatisation and outsourcing, we use the excuse that the system is in crisis, that there is a backlog, that it takes months to get a result and that we have to go to the wonderful private market. We treated cervical cancer screening, a vital service on which tens of thousands of women rely and for which they understand the need, like every other service or good and organised a tendering competition for it, inviting firms from around the world to bid for it and awarded it to the lowest bidder. That is the logic of the market in privatisation. That was the action of the Fianna FÃ¡il-Green Party Government, with Mary Harney, in 2008. The justification was that market competition and private companies were better than publicly funded and run health services.  In 2008 very definite and reasoned arguments were made in this Chamber against foreign multinational control of this vital service. Many of the arguments were made by the then Fine Gael health spokesperson, Senator James Reilly, and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan of the Labour Party. Their arguments were sound and clear. The firm that won the initial contract, Quest Diagnostics, had been found guilty of repeated episodes of fraud in overbilling; several studies found that the detection rate for higher grade pre-cancers was low, while we know from several sources in Ireland that there were severe and real problems in allowing a US firm such as this to provide screening for cancer. Dr. Gibbons warned that cases would be missed if we outsourced to the United States. The union which represents workers and scientists in laboratories warned that the outsourcing of smear test screening would mean that we would lose the ability and expertise to conduct such screening in this country. Many experts, doctors, scientists and consultants in the field were shouting at Fianna FÃ¡il, the Green Party and Mary Harney that this was bad, that it would cause problems, that women would suffer and that cancer cases would be missed. They were ignored and the political decision was made to pursue tendering and outsourcing. A couple of years later the very people who had railed and shouted against it got into power. When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in power, Senator James Reilly did nothing as Minister for Health and the subsequent Minsters for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, now the Taoiseach, and Deputy Simon Harris, did nothing about the issue about which they were so worried. The policy of outsourcing has continued and today we are hearing defences from the Taoiseach, the Minister and the HSE on the basis that the problem was not outsourcing but something else and that these things happen. One thing is clear: the privatisation of the health system is ideologically driven by the main parties in the DÃ¡il and in every area where it has been implemented people have suffered, continue to suffer and, worse in this case, women have died and will die as a result. We have no faith or belief the Government can address this crisis. It might succeed in pinning the blame on something else, but the scandal is political and involves the political choices made by various Ministers and those in power. If the Minister was a bus driver and crashed and killed 17 people, or even one person, he would be sanctioned by his employer and before the courts. Heads have to roll in this DÃ¡il for what has happened. It is not good enough to pass the buck. "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark" and, ultimately, somebody will have to take responsibility and take the consequences.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	361	We have a very patronising attitude to women in this society, as evidenced by the outrageous treatment of the women involved in this case, a paternalistic attitude among doctors to women, and a refusal to allow full disclosure to patients. I want to speak about an issue which some of the parties in this DÃ¡il do not seem to be interested in, namely, privatisation, which has led to this situation. The outsourcing of cervical smear tests in 2008 was part of the privatisation of health services. A critically important part of health services for women was starved of funding and resources. A HSE recruitment ban meant test backlogs inevitably built up and outsourcing became the solution. This is the way in which privatisation is usually forced through. Individuals must account for themselves but the majority of parties in this DÃ¡il also must account for themselves. In 2008, the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, was warned by senior people that private testing would be less rigorous and unsuitable for a three to five year frequency, that detection rates on tests carried out by Quest Diagnostics would be lower, at 85% versus 95% in the Irish laboratories, and that Quest Diagnostics had been fined $40 million for fraud and false claims. In response, Mary Harney and the then Fianna FÃ¡il Government opted for value for money and we got the worst of both worlds, with less frequent and low-quality testing leading us to where we are today. Dr. David Gibbons should be heroically saluted for warning about this ten years ago. How prophetic was what he said. It is likewise with Sam Coulter-Smith. The Rotunda Hospital had a world-class testing service and the majority of parties in this DÃ¡il opted for testing on the cheap. Profiting from health had been good value for Quest Diagnostics. Only two weeks ago, it reported revenue of almost â¬8 billion and profits of more than â¬1 billion in 2017. It is a company that carries out 80 to 100 smear tests per staff member per day when a maximum of 50 per day is the National Health Service recommended rate. In Ireland, 30 to 35 tests was the norm but nothing happened. The unusually low percentage of negative results was highlighted but nothing happened. The former Minister for Health and Children, James Reilly, and the then parties in power also did nothing. The test results never reached the 1.8 average which is international best practice, the reason being that the system chosen was not as good as that which pertained in the US never mind in Ireland. This outsourced service was retendered in 2010, 2012 and 2016 but no action was taken by those who were Ministers for Health and Children during that time, including Mary Coughlan and James Reilly. Despite the warning issued by James Reilly to Mary Harney in 2008, he chose not to act. The former Minister for Health and now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and current Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, also have questions to answer in regard to why they did nothing about the low rate of results. There were many debates in this House on the national screening programme down through the years but the nothing was done because the Government does not support public health services. It continues to underfund them and to look for the next privatisation opportunity. Thanks to this State, MedLab, the company which Vicky Phelan had to sue, has the contract for the privatised bowel screening programme. Does the Minister propose to do anything about this? The brutal treatment of Brigid McCole by Deputy Michael Noonan was eventually exposed. Despite all of the solemn undertakings, we now learn about the appalling treatment of the women in this case. What will be the next catastrophic failure of privatisation in this country? Will it be the privatised bowel screening programme? Will the Minister stop cutting corners on women's health and return to a nationalised public testing laboratory system that is adequately staffed and carries out deep screenings? The Minister said in his speech that a further tendering process will take place for testing carried out outside of the public system. Following on from the platitudes we have heard today, this DÃ¡il must ensure that the testing system is returned to public ownership and adequately funded and staffed. It is unbelievable that we do not have two pairs of eyes on every test result, as is standard in other countries.

Tragedies happen and they will continue to happen, but the issue facing us as a society is how we respond to those mistakes and tragedies, how we treat the victims of those mistakes and tragedies and whether we learn the lessons. I find the shock and horror expressed in some quarters a little hard to take. The saddest thing about this latest scandal is that it is just the latest one. It is not new to see the State Claims Agency taking people to war. It has been doing this for a long time. It is not new that the HSE drip-feeds information. Even tonight, the Minister has been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information. The Minister is continually being drip-fed and having to clarify information. We need to get to the heart of what is going on. This is the only way that we will serve Vicky Phelan and all of the other victims of our appalling health service. The Minister correctly said that this issue puts the spotlight on our open disclosure policy, which has been in place since 2013. It has been a policy of the HSE since 2008 that all instances should be disclosed, which is coincidental timing in terms of this issue, but it is long known that this is not the case and that what we have had is not enough. This was known in 2015 when we questioned the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on why there had not been a mandatory duty of candour inserted into medical contracts and why, given the weekly medical negligence claims and legal fees, a failure to disclose was not a criminal offence and so on. It was obvious in the discussions last year around the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill that there was a problem with open disclosure. Lest anyone is confused, this is only about indemnifying doctors and nurses. This is not an open disclosure policy, it is legal cover. We made the arguments at the Committee on Health and Fianna FÃ¡il was swayed by those arguments and came on board. What happened next? I got more attention from the HSE than I have got in my life. Over the summer, there were emergency calls and meetings arranged with the chief medical officer, all to tell us that we were wrong about our amendments. We had a meeting with the Department of Health and the HSE in which we asked for the evidence to support their argument and we were told that making open disclosure mandatory would make it less rather than more likely that open disclosure would happen. This was the line put forward by the Department of Health and the chief medical officer, the same line that was given to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, when he came before the health committee in 2015 and argued for mandatory disclosure. In my opinion, he genuinely put forward that view. He made the point as a doctor that failing to live up to a duty of candour was the equivalent of a motoring hit-and-run. He was fully signed up to mandatory open disclosure. The health committee, having heard from several stakeholders which said that mandatory open disclosure was necessary, did not recommend it. What happened? The arguments were made, the science and international evidence was produced and previous Ministers, Fianna FÃ¡il colleagues and others supported mandatory open disclosure, yet behind the scenes the HSE went to work and put out the argument that it was not the best way forward. The HSE can dress it up whatever they like, but at the heart of that dressing up is a fear of litigation. The HSE tells Ministers that this and that cannot be done because it will cost the State money. It is symptomatic of problems in that organisation. It gives me no pleasure to say, "We told you so". We stand over the arguments we made last year. Sadly, if they had been incorporated in the legislation, we would be further down the road and not moving after the horse has bolted. I am open to a HIQA inquiry in the sense that HIQA is good, but I echo the point that it is limited in its scope to an extent. I think we have to go further. In 1987, the New Zealand Government ordered a full-scale independent judicial inquiry into the deaths of 26 women who died in the 1970s and 1980s from cervical cancer, again a national scandal. This inquiry was an independent inquiry along the lines of the Commission on Nursing in this State, which is what we need if we are to get to the root of this and get to the heart of way in which women's health and reproductive issues are dealt with, or rather are not dealt with, in the State.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	364	Not too long ago I praised the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for his speech on the eighth amendment. I warned the Minister that night that I would not be praising him permanently and I certainly do not praise him tonight. The Minister's speech tonight is more of a spin than an elucidation of what has happened. Reference was made to Brigid McCole who died in October 1996, just over 21 years ago. There has been time to reason and learn from that. At that time the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, acting for then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, warned Positive Action that unless it went quietly to the compensation tribunal it would face "uncertainties, delays, stresses, confrontation and costs," and so on. The State pursued Brigid McCole almost right up to the day of her death. It said she had tried to sue under a pseudonym in order to keep her privacy. The State also fought that. I do not have to time to go into the details but we could see the full power of the State coming down on the body of a woman, Brigid McCole, and her family. Here we are 22 years later with the same type of spin. The Brigid McCole case was absolute bullying but what is coming across now is more of a patronising attitude that "we know best". As a woman, I do not want reassurance. I do not believe that the women of Ireland want reassurance. They would like full information so they can make up their minds on what screening they will access. With regard to this specific issue, the women who are affected need full information. The Minister told the House tonight that information is "emerging" as we speak. The Minister has given Members a copy of a note in regard to the briefing memo. The Minister's speech has a mistake in it. On page 2 of the speech, the Minister refers to the note which said that the claim against the HSE was likely to fail or be "dropped in the absence of any bad faith". That is not accurate. The note had referred to exemplary damages and the advice from the State Claims Agency that the exemplary damages might not succeed because of lack of faith, not that the case would be dropped. The note also mentions that there was no chance of the case settling because - I believe very bravely - the woman in question would not accept a confidentiality clause. The lab had said that it absolutely had to have a confidentiality clause. Deputy Alan Kelly has already referred to the extraordinary aspect that the National Screening Service and Mr. Jerome Coffey, the head of the National Cancer Control Programme had advised the Department in writing that this was not a "patient safety incident". Perhaps the Minister will explain how anybody could possibly say this was not a patient safety incident. There is so little time. I do not believe a HIQA investigation is the answer. There are so many questions and to say that HIQA is the answer is certainly, at the very least, premature. We need to establish the full facts and reports on how many women have not been contacted. It is not good enough for the Minister to come to the House tonight to tell us that facts are "emerging". I received an email from a person who pointed out that a smear test in 2012 had a result that was interpreted wrongly, or a wrong result given. This happened on two different occasions and radical surgery ensued in August 2015. I understand that this person wrote to the head of the screening programme, but no reply was received. How many letters have been sent by women throughout the State that have not been replied to? What other legal proceedings have been instituted, settled or are still pending? How many cases have been settled with confidentiality clauses because the women had to cave in given their circumstances? At the very least, all this information should be before the House tonight. It is extremely worrying to me as a woman when I have heard language being used on the radio over the last week or two, which seeks to reassure us. Reassurance cannot, and should not, be given. That is not our role at this point nor is it the Government's. It is the Government's role to give full information and to set up a proper, independent inquiry that, with full information, will give some trust back to the women who have been affected and to the women of Ireland. I do not want any platitudes nor do the women who are writing to me.

While the process is important women should remain the focus. Population health screening is an important part of our health service, and none more so than cervical screening. Confidence must be restored in the cervical cancer screening programme because this programme has identified 1,482 cases of cancer over the past ten years. The majority of those cases have been identified by the cervical screening programme. Many thousands of pre-cancerous changes have also been identified, preventing people from developing cancer and preventing the progression of cancer in some people. The importance of the scheme is without doubt. Hundreds of thousands of consultations take place in general practice each year where sexual health is the subject of the consultation when people attend for screening. This is also very important. There are many aspects of the screening programme that must be maintained and confidence in the programme must be restored. The cervical cancer screening programme works for the vast majority of women in Ireland who engage on a regular three-yearly cervical screening smear. The regularity is essential - one smear is a case in point. If a woman has a regular smear it adds to the value of those smears. Like all screening programmes, cervical screening has its limitations and false negatives will arise no matter what the screening programme is. These must be kept to a minimum by having a double reading, by having high-quality screening laboratories and by upskilling those who perform the screening. This will keep mistakes to a minimum. This scandal is what transpires when mistakes are identified but the information is not transmitted. This is the core issue. The failure of open disclosure of false negatives to patients is unforgivable, and there may be additional false negatives now because we are hearing that not all cases have been audited. It is true that disclosure would not have affected the treatment of these patients' cancer but that is not the point. Disclosure would have helped the women to deal with their illness. It would have provided them with knowledge and it would have given them the opportunity to take legal action if they felt they had been damaged or injured by the process and if they wished to do so. The issue now is that the process has trumped the patient. This is so often the case in many health scandals; the process becomes much more important than the patient. Governance and poor judgment are the key to this. Such paternalistic attitudes towards transmitting information have to be eradicated from our health service. In one sense Vicky Phelan was lucky in that she had the capacity, the will and the knowledge to pursue her case. Many of the patients whose false negative results were not transmitted to them have not had that opportunity. This scandal has arisen by not disclosing these issues for fear that the cervical screening programme had something to hide and by not being upfront and honest. Being upfront and honest, admitting that a mistake had been made and transmitting the knowledge would have empowered the programme and the patient. Admitting a mistake is very empowering for the person who admits it but it is also empowering to the patient who receives the information. By not disclosing these issues we now have the current scandal and the lack of confidence in the cervical screening programme. Quite often it is the cover-up of the issue that attracts the attention rather than the original mistake. We have to recognise that it is most likely that the cervical screening programme did not wish to reveal the false negatives for fear of litigation, but now we are in midst of this scandal. Open disclosure is the only way to go and mandatory open disclosure is extremely important.We have to engage in a root-and-branch review of the cervical cancer screening programme. We have to review outsourcing, the frequency and quality of testing, the governance of the cervical screening programme, the responsibility, and the transparency in it. We have to review open disclosure and have mandatory disclosure. We have to review compensation and try to restore credibility in the service.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	366	Here we are again, debating once more the chronic and apparently unresolvable dysfunction within both the HSE and sections of the health service. We know that at least 17 women have died. We also know that this is far from the end of the matter and that in all likelihood, as time goes on, more women and families will emerge. Children will be and have been robbed of their mothers' precious love. Young girls and boys will now grow up with no mother to share their concerns and their hopes and dreams. It is an appalling dereliction of care and a catastrophic failure that is making the people of this country sick to the core. The infuriating thing about this is that we never seem to learn our lessons sufficiently well from the previous debacle and mistakes. We all lament the deaths of these women. We all praise and support the courage of Vicky Phelan and her husband and children, who are now enduring a living hell. I salute Mr. Cian O'Carroll, a solicitor from Cashel, too. All of this was brought to light out of the murky shadows of legal wrangling by a mother who was determined to find answers and to have accountability, on her own. If Vicky had not done this, would we still be living in blissful ignorance of the shocking failures of oversight and governance that have brought us to this situation? I say that we would. The Taoiseach had the gall to say today that we should not call for the head of Mr. Tony OâBrien, head of the HSE, because, the Taoiseach said, "everyone deserves a fair hearing". My goodness. How many fair hearings must Mr. O'Brien get before he is sacked? What fair hearings have the unfortunate ladies who have died, and their families, got? That is arrogance of the highest order. What about fair hearings and fair procedures for the women and families caught up in this sickening spectacle? Last week I criticised Uisce Ãireann on another matter by saying that it had displayed institutional arrogance. The very same could be said of the HSE. This is institutional arrogance and indeed political arrogance on the most horrifying scale. What hope can any of us place in such a body as the HSE, the most senior management of which seem indifferent to the realities of human life and whose first response is to ring for the barristers at the first hint of trouble. It is continuous and the barristers are creaming it all the way. The person or persons involved are then bombarded with legal challenges and intimidated further, adding to already existing stress. Where is the shame then? Where is the mock rage or sense of outrage then, when we do this daily? I salute the extraordinary courage of Vicky Phelan and all those women and families who have been dragged unwillingly into a scandal of enormous dimensions. Agencies of the State have robbed them of peace and subjected them to an horrific ordeal. At the very least it is a scandal which demands the resignation of Mr. O'Brien and the Minister, Deputy Harris. The Minister is the head. As I said earlier today, the governance structure of the HSE is absolutely clear. The buck stops with the Minister, Deputy Harris, as the person who has overall responsibility for the leadership of those who direct and control its functions and who manage its business. In light of that, it is completely unsatisfactory for the calls for resignations to be reserved to Mr. O'Brien, the CEO, whom the Minister defended here recently, saying he was right to call parents emotional terrorists. I called the Minister a puppet of the HSE that day, and he is still a puppet. This is disgraceful and the Minister must go. Any objective observer who analyses the Minister's stewardship of the health service can only conclude that he has been an unmitigated disaster. There are record levels of patients on trolleys, chronic lack of bed capacity, a recruitment and retention policy of front-line staff that has had abysmal outcomes and last but not least a systemically dysfunctional HSE that has caused dozens of lives to be lost. What on earth will it take for the Minister to be sacked or to resign? Has he no shame? Look at Theresa May's Government. She has lost four Ministers in a short time and nobody died. This is manslaughter at least. The gardaÃ­ in any other country would be out arresting people and charging them with manslaughter or worse. This is shameful. It is wilful destruction of people's lives and families, perpetrated by the HSE ad nauseam. The Minister came to Cashel with me and looked at a pristine new building that was empty. This is outrageous. The Minister has to open it and put beds in it. There is still not a bed in it. The Minister has no say whatsoever in the HSE so he should stand aside and let in someone who can stand up and do the job. The Minister is clearly unable, unfit and unwilling to do it. Shame on the Minister and on his colleagues. He must go now and bring Mr. O'Brien with him.

I pay tribute to Vicky Phelan, who has done this State some service. We know something of this scandal that is unfolding because of her determination and courage. Thanks to her bravery and refusal to sign a confidentiality clause, we are now beginning to find out just what happened behind this whole debacle. Had it not been for that, we might not have known anything about this. We were very lucky that Vicky Phelan is the brave person that she is. This may all have been hidden behind a court case and confidentiality clause. The priority in all of this has to be the women concerned. We have to ensure that everything possible can be done for them. It has not been done up to now but at this point the Minister has to give an absolute commitment that everything possible will be done for those women in the provision of whatever health services and supports are required. There is also a requirement that the Minister give a commitment that the State will not contest any cases that are in process or that might arise as a result of this scandal. There can be no question of the State pursuing any of these women in the aggressive manner that we saw displayed with Vicky Phelan and many other cases through the years. That has to be a priority. The other priority has to be all of those women who are now so nervous and are wondering if they will get a phone call. For that reason, I think there was mishandling of this in recent days. The information that was available to the Minister and HSE was not made available and huge uncertainty was allowed to develop over many days. The Minister has made a shocking disclosure to us tonight, that there is a potentially considerable additional number of women who are not subject to audit and we do not have any information about them. It is not acceptable to put all of this into an inquiry where we may or may not get answers in 12 months or longer. Experience with other inquiries and tribunals is that we have been told that an issue is all a matter for an inquiry or tribunal. That is not good enough in this case. We have to get answers now, not in 12 months. The Minister needs to come into this House in a matter of days when he has further information about that shocking disclosure that he made tonight. There is a fundamental question at the heart of this issue, about how it is that an audit was carried out, not acted on, why there was such a long delay in notifying the clinicians' concern and, more importantly, why there was such a delay or utter failure to notify the women concerned. We need to know what policy is being pursued. Is the Minister still talking about a situation that is utterly paternalistic where women are kept in the dark? Will the Minister clarify that for us? What is the policy in that respect now? Will the Minister clarify, with regard to the duty of candour, when action will be taken and when the medical and legal professions will be faced down in this regard? We have no more time to waste with that.

I have listened to various views expressed in that regard. I have a concern about the view that we should opt for a commission of inquiry because all Members know that in spite of constant promises to the contrary such inquiries take years and always have, which would not be in the interests of families caught up in this scandal. I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that perhaps a way to approach this would be to immediately instigate an inquiry by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and set up a wider commission which would investigate how to create a patient-centred healthcare system and would consider the key issue of how to avoid a recurrence of what the Minister referred to as the paternalistic approach to medicine displayed in this case. That commission would be key because the scale of the change we must make is huge. Any inquiry should begin with the question of what happened in 2008. There was a clear DÃ¡il debate on the issue at the time. Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith have made clear that at the time they placed on the record real concerns with the policy approach that was taken. I have asked colleagues and friends who were then in government to recall the Government internal mechanisms around the issue. To the best of our recollection, it was not a contentious issue. Whether it was motivated by a desire to scale up the number of cervical smear tests in order to save lives or, as some have argued, an attempt to save money by contracting out that service must be investigated. I have no recollection of it being the latter rather than the former. Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister in his statement addressed the argument of Dr. David Gibbons which I heard yesterday, that the divergence between an annual versus a three-year screening system may have been the cause of some of the problems. Although that question may have been answered elsewhere, I hope it will be answered here this evening. The Taoiseach clearly stated that there does not appear to be a difference between the various screening processes being used in terms of the level of accuracy and so on but we must have more detail on that issue. We must have answers to key questions, such as who was involved in the 162 of 208 cases in which the information was not passed on and the reason for that. Which clinicians were involved? Who was responsible for that lack of disclosure? The most numbing and frightening effect for everyone involved in the Irish health system is the question mark over whether a patient can trust that he or she is being told the right thing. We must have further details on that issue. I listened with interest today to Members I respect and who have much experience in this area, and from them I heard the common theme that the lack of candour or disclosure may have been due to a fear of litigation. That brings me back to the wider commission of inquiry. I raised earlier with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who answered my question on promised legislation, the issue of whether there are plans to move away from a legally based system to a no-fault medical liability system. As Deputy Shortall and others stated, we must ensure that everyone involved in this process of inquiry will not be shut down by the fear of legal action. How can that be done without a shift away from the current system? As the Taoiseach stated earlier, there always will be a small percentage of false negatives or false positives. Given that is the case, surely it would be better for us to move away from this being a legal process towards admitting fault, helping patients and being patient-centred in what we do.

Without her courage, we would be still in blissful ignorance of this scandal. This is another shocking and shameful episode in the history of this State. Women have been again badly failed. On this occasion, 162 women had medical information withheld from them and, sadly, 17 have passed away. The scandal is the result of a toxic culture of dishonesty, cover-up and concealment. It is a profound ethical failure and an appalling breach of trust. What is worse is that this policy of deliberate deceit was signed off on and agreed by the senior management of CervicalCheck. It was not the decision of an individual. The policy agreed by that committee deprived women of their absolute entitlement to know their medical conditions. It was also fraudulent because it deprived women of their entitlement to claim compensation if they so wished. We must have accountability. The entire senior management team of CervicalCheck must resign or be removed. This scandal is the result of the neo-liberal policies of the Fianna FÃ¡Ã­l-Progressive Democrats Government and successive Governments since then. These policies were initially implemented by the extreme capitalist free marketeer and then Minister for Health Mary Harney, supported by the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy. The policies have been continued to this day by successive Governments and Ministers. The HSE was established specifically to allow Ministers to evade responsibility for our health services, including debacles and scandals such as this one. It was never fit for purpose. It should never have been set up and must be abolished forthwith. Its functions should be reabsorbed into the Department of Health, and the Department and Minister made responsible for the health services.

I will begin by addressing the new information the Minister revealed to the Chamber this evening. There is a great deal of public confusion, fear and anger over this issue. Women have asked me if they might get a phone call to tell them the caller is very sorry but they have cervical cancer. We know that is not the case and that the women who will be contacted have been already diagnosed with cancer. However, it gives an indication of the level of fear out there. I acknowledge the Minister coming to the Chamber and sharing the information as he did before a carefully crafted response on the issue was prepared but I wish to get into the detail of it. The Minister stated, "While CervicalCheck has audited all cases notified to it, I have been informed that a potentially considerable number of cases will not have been subjected to an audit of their screening history." CervicalCheck carried out an audit in the case of 1,482 women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer and a review was warranted in 442 of those cases. Some 208 false negatives were discovered and 162 of the women affected by those findings were not told of them. In terms of trying to understand how many more cases might exist, a total of 2,100 cases are recorded on the registry between 2008 and 2014. Assuming there were approximately 250 new cases per year - it used to be approximately 300 but has decreased - for the period 2015 to 2017, inclusive, and 2018 to date, it would total approximately 900 additional cases. Therefore, from 2008 until now there have been approximately 3,000 cases. CervicalCheck stated it has been informed in approximately 1,500 cases but a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests there may be approximately double that number. I appreciate it may be unfair to throw numbers at the Minister in this manner and I am not trying to catch him out but does he have a sense of whether we are talking about a few more cases, double the number or many times more?

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	I have been fully truthful and open on this issue since I became aware of it and wanted to continue in that vein tonight but what I was told of this evening is as Deputy Donnelly correctly outlined. I had been told, and I believe most Members of this House would have understood, that CervicalCheck was notified of all cases of cervical cancer by the national cancer registry. I have said to this House consistently that CervicalCheck has audited all cases of cervical cancer of which it is aware. That is true, but what is now emerging is that there are cases of cervical cancer known by the national cancer registry that are not known by CervicalCheck. This has literally come to light from the serious incident management team's work. That is the team we sent in to CervicalCheck to get to the bottom of all these issues on Friday. I do not want to put out specific figures because, quite frankly, I do not know them but the figures Deputy Donnelly has presented sound about right based on my knowledge of the prevalence of cervical cancer in this country on a yearly basis. However, that comes with a major caveat that I have not been given any figure in regard to the number. I need to say, however, because Deputy Donnelly's point about not causing unnecessary fear and concern above the level that is understandably already there is important, that these are women who know they have cancer. The State does not have an audit or a file on them it has not shared with them but because they were never passed on to CervicalCheck or were never with CervicalCheck, they were never subject to the clinical audit to which cases like Vicky Phelan's or others would have been subjected. They will now be included in the clinical audit, and I am aware that all the relevant agencies will appear before the Oireachtas health committee tomorrow, but I am sharing all of the information I have with this House, as I have it, right now.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	375	I thank the Minister for that. I will move on to the second question shortly, which is around actions to date, but to come back to the issue of the current level of fear, I ask the Minister to consider any other possible measures that could be taken in terms of public communications tonight, tomorrow or in the coming days. I am very happy to offer Fianna FÃ¡il's support or co-operation if it is of any use, but I believe there needs to be clearer communication in terms of the exact points we are discussing now because, strange as we may find it, not everyone in the country is listening to the DÃ¡il debates. There is a need for further clear public communication and reassurance on the points raised this evening. The second set of questions I want to ask the Minister is about his response to the note he received. Political accusations are being thrown around the Chamber, some of which are unseemly given what we are dealing with. I am not asking these questions to score political points. I am asking these questions because it is our constitutional role to hold the Minister to account, and we need to know what happened from his perspective when he got the note. The note references non-disclosures, the screening errors and the likelihood of publicity. I acknowledge there was nothing in the note to tell the Minister that there were numerous cases and that there was a much bigger issue coming down. That was not in the note, but I put it to him that there were several things in the note which could reasonably have led him to ask more questions, and maybe he did that. My question is: further to the note, did the Minister make further inquiries as to the scale of this? On Vicky Phelan's lawyer's charge, did he seek advice as to whether the State Claims Agency should be instructed to pull back from the situation? Did he start to put in place any of the responses that it appears from this side of the House only began to be considered from Thursday morning?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	376	I thank Deputy Donnelly for his constructive offer of support, and I would appreciate the support of any Member of this House in terms of what we can do to reassure the public. I take the point Deputy Connolly makes about that but there are women asking many questions and I want to provide them with the right information. I would point out for the information of the House that new guidance has been put up on cervicalcheck.ie tonight and any woman can log on to that. There is a section on frequently asked questions. It also highlights answers to many of the questions that have been coming in to the helpline. Guidance for general practitioners, GPs, on how to deal with the issue of repeat smears and women who are coming into their clinics, of whom I believe there are many, for understandable reasons, asking if they should get a repeat smear test or if their smear will be reassessed will issue this week. Dr. David Hanlon, the Health Service Executive's clinical adviser on general practice, is working with the GP representative organisations on that as well. I met the Irish Cancer Society today and it had some very constructive suggestions as to what we could do to help provide information to women. I intend to act on many of those suggestions. I will be happy to update the Members as I progress them. I am scheduled to meet it again next week to update it on actions. It can be a very important conduit in terms of providing information to cancer patients throughout the country and to their families. Deputy Donnelly asks a perfectly legitimate question that I should be asked, that I am happy to be asked and that this House has an obligation to ask, namely, what I did when I got the note. I received this information note, which I have published with only personal details of the individual redacted, on my Department's website. I received it just before 7 p.m. on the evening of Monday, 16 April. I was in a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, at the time. I then had a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers and Ministers of State later that evening, Cabinet the next morning and pre-Cabinet from 8.30 a.m. I suspect I read the note around Tuesday afternoon. As the Deputy knows, the case was on the Wednesday or Thursday of that week. I read it about the Tuesday afternoon, so a huge period of time had not elapsed. That is an important point to make. I was not sitting on a note, nor did I have a note and days or weeks elapsed. I read the note, and I have read it thousands of times since, as the Deputy can imagine, because when one reads the note now one reads it very differently from how I read it then. I read the note as stating that an individual patient was taking a case against a laboratory and against the HSE. Rightly or wrongly, I read it that the case against the HSE was likely to be dropped. I specifically read the line that "[i]n its view the case is likely to be settled shortly before going to court", never expecting this issue would go to court. Regarding the section on clinical audit, I read it that all historical and current audits had been given to clinicians for communication onwards to patients. If I read the note now, in the light of what I know, one would read it differently but I did not know about other cases. I did not know about Dr. Flannelly's correspondence. I did not even know what is emerging this evening. I read the note as an information note to me, of which I get very many as a Minister, and not in the context of receiving a note today.

The final question I want to ask is around this conspiracy of silence because this is not an isolated case of one official or one doctor. The HSE has a 300-page policy document on open disclosure and yet what we have here is evidence of widespread and, I would argue, systematic withholding of patient information. We know there is a circular stating that doctors should exercise their judgment. We know that before 2015 there was no policy of even telling the doctors and that that decision was only taken in 2015. We know that in 13 different hospitals, doctors did not tell their patients. We know that Vicky Phelan's doctor got into correspondence with the HSE and CervicalCheck about who had responsibility. It is worth pointing out that Ms Phelan made the point in an interview that when she was told, she was told there was a query. Perhaps she was being told in an open and forthright manner. We are in no position to judge. We are not privy to that conversation but Ms Phelan's assertion was that even when she was told, she did not register what she was being told. She used the word "query". She was told there had been a query. It was only when she was handed her own patient notes and was sitting in a waiting room that she discovered what was meant by "query" was that there was an error in her screening in 2011, which is very different from a query. At this point, what does the Minister know in terms of who knew about this? The question Ms Phelan has asked is who knew what, and who decided what? I know this is early days but in terms of the HSE, we know that a senior official within the Limerick hospitals group was brought into the dispute between the doctor and CervicalCheck. We know that was escalated to the head of acute hospitals for the entire HSE. At a very senior level within the HSE, therefore, at least one person knew. Does the Minister have a sense now of how widespread was the knowledge within the HSE?Does the Minister have a sense of whether the Department was aware not specifically of Ms Phelan's case because we know that it was but of the suppression or even withholding of information from patients like Ms Phelan?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	380	What I have learned in recent days is that the only thing I can say with absolute 100% certainty is what I know. That is why I want to have a statutory inquiry to establish the exact answers to the Deputy's very important questions about who knew what, when and where. As the Deputy can imagine, in recent days and since last week I have spoken extensively with my departmental officials. I am very clear that they have informed me that they had no knowledge of a suppression of information or certainly anything that emerged in the national media through the discovery documents presented in Vicky Phelan's case. My officials will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and, rightly, should be asked questions about this issue. The Deputy makes an interesting point. A clinical audit is really good. If one is the Minister for any Department and one hears that there is to be a clinical audit or audits, one welcomes it because a clinical audit is good. What happened was, as Deputy Michael Harty said, that the patient clearly was completely lost in the process. We see the most unedifying situation where doctors were writing letters about who should tell the woman in questin or whether they should tell her. What is even worse is that we now know that for many doctors there was not even an exchange of correspondence. Information was simply put on file, with the paternalistic view that Ms X or Ms Y did not actually need to know the information. We need a statutory review. Of course, we expect doctors to exercise their judgment, but I would certainly expect doctors with any information on my health or my health files to tell me. That did not happen and it points to the need for this House to take very practical action on the issue of mandatory open disclosure.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	381	On page 2 of the memo published it is stated the "National Screening Service and Jerome Coffey, Head of the National Cancer Control Programme, have advised the Department in writing that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident". Will the Minister share with the House when that advice was given and when exactly the Department knew? I do not think it is credible that it knew but that the Minister did not. However, that is what we are being led to believe. Will the Minister confirm when the Department knew? On the same page of the memo it is stated BLM solicitors "have shared a copy of an expert report with the SCA which we understand will form part of the laboratory's defence in the context of liability and causation". Again, no date is given. I find it a little curious that there are no dates given in this document. There does not seem to be any information on when it was sent or received. It does not seem to have been stamped. The two specific questions I have posed are really important. Elsewhere in the memo we read that the Department "is in consultation with the HSE in regard to their preparation of a press statement on the matter". We have all sat through criticisms from all sides of the House of the obsessive fixation of certain members of the Government with spin. I suggest it was very much known that this was going to cause an issue and that it would be a national incident which would be added to the list of scandals that have surrounded the Government because in the briefing note to the Minister we see that preparations were being made for the inevitable press fallout.  My final question on this section relates to the assertion that Jerome Coffey advised that the National Cancer Control Programme did not consider this to be a "patient safety incident". It is absolutely outrageous that the NCCP would not consider it to be a patient safety incident. The memo was prepared for the Minister. I ask him to let me and everyone else listening know whether he regards it as a patient safety incident. Does he regard it as something that should have that tag? I certainly would consider it to be a patient safety incident.

I expect my Department to provide the Deputy will all relevant dates tomorrow at the Oireachtas committee meeting, but 6 April was the date on which my officials tell me that the Department was first made aware. On the evening of 16 April, the note to which the Deputy refers arrived to me. What Dr. Coffey is saying or is alleged to have said is that it was not a patient safety incident but rather one related to the known limitations of screening. He goes on to point out that the current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which can have low sensitivity and which produces a not insignificant number of false negative results. It was certainly the view in the note, based on the fact that it was an individual case, that, sadly, sometimes our screening programme could produce false negatives. That is certainly how I read it. Obviously, knowing what we now know-----

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	388	No, my Department did not know on 6 April about 208 other patients, about Dr. Flannelly's correspondence with Dr. Hickey, or a range of other issues. Knowing what we now know, namely, that there was a much more widespread issue for women in this country, clearly it was an issue of significant patient concern. On the press statement, if one reads the statement, one will see that it was aimed at reassuring people about our cancer screening programmes and how they actually saved lives. I am not getting into the political space, but the statement was such that if the Minister of the day happened to be asked a question on foot of an individual case, he or she would have been able to express confidence in the screening programme, but obviously not now, knowing what I now know.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	389	I restate that there was a heavy emphasis on spin, no matter what way one looks at it, in terms of the answer being given to the Minister if anyone were to ask a hard question. It is not credible that the Department knew of this but the Minister did not. This is a very serious case which involves a young woman with two small children who is gravely ill. It was known that it was going to hit the headlines. That is clear. In what format did the Minister receive this advice? Was it emailed to him or was a hard copy handed to him?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	390	It was emailed to me and I was given a hard copy.

I appreciate that the Minister is busy, but the note was not read until the following day. I still find it odd that officials in the Department knew for ten days but did not feel obliged to bring the matter to the Minister's attention. It makes me wonder about how many other cases there are of this nature that the State Claims Agency might fight vigorously and aggressively and which might end with a gagging clause, meaning that we would never find out about them. The fact that ten days elapsed is a source of serious concern. The Minister received the note and then read it the next day. As the Department had had it for ten days, 11 days had elapsed at that stage. At any stage did the Minister ask if there were more women involved? Did he ask if it was symptomatic of a wider problem within the health service? In that regard, to be fair, the Minister has shared the information he had with the House. He is correct in suggesting there would be uproar if he had not done so. I fully appreciate that, but officials had all weekend to review it and we still cannot say with certainty what the numbers are. The Minister is making his best guess and Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly was trying to work it out, as I was, on the back of an envelope. That is absolutely outrageous. I have used the screening service and all weekend was taking calls from friends and family members who wanted to know if they could have faith in it. I told them that the questions would be answered in the DÃ¡il, but the Minister has come here and given us his best guess. The serious incident management team had all weekend to do nothing other than review the matter. Does the Minister think it is acceptable at this stage that we still cannot say anything with certainty?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	392	I assure the Deputy that I do not think it is acceptable that I am coming into the House to address it on such an important matter and that I am hearing this information only moments before coming into it and hoping I have enough time to explain to it, factually, what I have been told.If I had more detail, Deputy O'Reilly would have it right now. I provided my best indication of the detail during my exchange with Deputy Donnelly. Having just checked the matter with my officials, I can inform the House that the correspondence from Dr. Jerome Coffey was dated 11 April. The Department first became aware of the matter on 6 April and I have been informed by my officials that Dr. Coffey made the comments referenced in my note on 11 April. The Deputy has suggested that the fact that I received this by means of email shows that it is important. She should see the volume of emails I get from officials through my private secretary each day. If something is viewed as very important or very urgent, it is usually followed by a phone call, a face-to-face briefing or a formal submission to the Minister. I read this information note when it was sent to me. I would read it in a very different context now. I read it thousands of times over the weekend. I thought "if I knew then what I know now", but I did not know that then. I read it in the context of what I knew then. I read it as an individual case. I read it as a situation in which doctors and women had been informed, but it is clear now that this was not the case. The moment I became aware that this was not the case, I took very swift action. I think I have answered the Deputy's questions.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	393	We have raised the issue of outsourcing. When a cytologist who gave evidence to the HIQA inquiry into the case of Ms Rebecca O'Malley raised queries about the inferiority of the US screening, the chair of the inquiry advised him that the terms of reference of the inquiry did not allow it to consider this aspect of the matter. He said that the question of outsourcing was outside the scope of the inquiry, but he offered to make a note of it. As a woman who uses that service, I am absolutely reassured when I hear that someone made a note of this somewhere. How many audits were carried out regarding these outsourced companies? How regularly were they carried out? How many of the teleconferences on which Mr. O'Brien has advised he relies for the exchange of information actually took place? At what level did they take place? Who was talking to whom? Have the contracts for outsourced smear testing been renewed since 2011? Does the company, Clinical Pathology Laboratories, still hold a contract with the State for smear tests or for any other diagnostic work? I think this is an extremely important question. It appears from what happened in the HIQA inquiry I have mentioned that it will be precluded from looking at outsourcing. If so, that inquiry will be deficient from the very beginning. I am not alone in expressing the view - it has been expressed by clinicians - that the decision to outsource this service is at the root of this problem. The then Minister for Health and Children in the Fianna FÃ¡il-led Government of the time, Mary Harney, was quite prepared to say she believed the savings were in the magnitude of one third. Mr. O'Brien would not comment on the cost of it at the time. I voiced my opposition to it at the time. At no stage do I recall anyone relying on quality or other evidence. The then Minister was very quick to point out that we would be getting it cheap. As we know, if one buys cheaply, one will pay twice. I would be interested to know about the scale of the audit. Were any concerns raised? When the cytologist who was giving evidence to the Rebecca O'Malley inquiry advised that the tests in the US were inferior, was that flagged? I would like to go back to the note that was received by the Minister. He has said it would be normal for him to get a formal note as a ministerial briefing. He has pointed out that he gets many emails and I am sure that is the case. Does he not think officials in his Department should have flagged this up to him as important? From the moment they knew about it, they should have been asking questions about how many people were going to be involved in it. They should have been bringing the potential impact of this issue to his attention in order to avoid the Minister coming into the DÃ¡il, as he has done tonight, to give us his best guess at the figures without knowing what the actually are.

In fairness to the officials in the Department, we are again having a conversation in the context of information that is known now but was not known to them then, as far as I am informed. There is a reason we are having a statutory review and a statutory inquiry. It will answer some of the questions the Deputy has asked. I think we need to be very careful. If we are telling people that screening in Ireland is good, works and saves lives, all of which is true, we should not then cast doubt on the locations where smears are being read.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	398	I do not have a monopoly on that. I have heard the Deputy saying that as well. It is more useful if I say a few sentences before she comes back in. Even if we are saying that our screening programme is really important, I think it causes unnecessary alarm to express concern about where smears are being sent and about the validity of the results from there. I do not believe the Deputy intends to do that. She has been very responsible in regard to all of this. She knows a lot about it. I fully accept that there are legitimate issues to be raised regarding the laboratories we use. It is also important to say that these laboratories are accredited. According to a note that has been posted tonight on the frequently asked questions section of www.cervicalcheck.ie, "the laboratory involved in the case reported in the media, CPL, is not one of the laboratories currently used by CervicalCheck". The website names the three laboratories that are used: Quest Diagnostics in New Jersey, MedLab Pathology in Dublin and the Coombe Women and Infants Hospital in Dublin. That is the factual information today. As I said in my opening speech, when we move to HPV screening we will have an opportunity to reconfigure our laboratory services as well. The Deputy can question officials from the HSE on what was audited when they are at her disposal at the joint committee tomorrow. This matter will also be considered by the inquiry. When I speak as Minister for Health about the laboratories we are using, I have to say that countries like the US are not exactly the wild west in terms of medical technology. A great deal of progress has been made since the programme was set up and it was decided to outsource some testing to these laboratories, which was not a decision made by me. We have gone from a situation pre-programme where we had 300,000 smears in Ireland to one where we have 250,000 smears. We have gone from a situation pre-programme where the programme was showing no benefit in relation to mortality to one where we see mortality reducing by 7% a year. We have gone from a programme of no clinical audit to one of clinical audit.

We are thinking about her tonight. She is watching this debate. I wonder what she is thinking as further revelations are literally happening live in this Chamber. She tweeted a while ago to say "I will be appearing on @RTE_PrimeTime tonight to react to the latest disturbing developments in this ever deepening scandal". I am referring to her tweet for a reason. The information that was provided during Leaders' Questions earlier today when the Taoiseach was questioned on this issue is already out of date. It was actually a waste of time. The Minister for Health needs to assure us that the information he is giving us tonight will not be out of date by tomorrow. I have no confidence that this will be the case. It is extraordinary that the Minister has walked in here to say he does not know how many cases there are. What in the name of God were all the senior management officials in the National Screening Service doing all weekend? There are nine people in the central service and three people in CervicalCheck. The lady who has resigned was reporting to the head of screening. The national director is next. There is also the chief clinical officer, etc. There are 17 people in management alone, but they could not bloody well tell the Minister that there were extra cases outside the national registry. It is not acceptable that the Minister has come in here tonight without knowing how many cases there are and neither is what the Minister was told as he was coming in here acceptable.What in the name of God did the Minister say to the people who told him this? Who told him this as he walked in here tonight? What did the Minister do? I know what I would have done if somebody told me that and had not done his or her job all weekend. What are all these people doing? Instead of having confidence tonight, this is the main story on RTÃ and it will be the main story around the country.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	433	The response would not have contained parliamentary language. Along with everybody in this House, I have been working in a responsible manner to try to put facts into the public domain and get to a point where we can establish answers for women, care for the women who have been let down and try to ensure we have a screening programme that can be improved as a result of Ms Phelan. This landed this evening. It is important, however, to specify what this is. I have made the point already but it is important. This does not amount to more people at home with cancer who did not know they had cancer. This does not amount to more people at home who had an audit that was not shared with them. These are people who were not known to CervicalCheck who are on the national cancer registry, who have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer and who have received or are receiving treatment for cervical cancer. They never benefited from the clinical audit process. That is utterly unacceptable. In light of what is happening this evening, I am very much moving in my mindset in the direction outlined by the Deputy earlier. The Acting Chairman will probably tell me I have run out of time but I would like to interact with Deputies in this House. I heard Ms Phelan make the point during the week that she does not want a long inquiry or tribunal, and I know nobody wants that. HIQA has powers that could bring much good to this and we have used them in a number of other important areas, including the Portlaoise babies scandal and the case of Ms Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway. The authority has got to the bottom of things and made our services safer. I also take the point there may be bigger and wider matters emerging. How we address this as an Oireachtas and Government is an issue. Perhaps after the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health tomorrow we should review where we are at. I am certainly willing to meet representatives of other political parties and groupings, as we have done with other difficult or important national matters, to work out how best to address this. I cannot decide matters for the Government on the hoof on the floor of the DÃ¡il. I nevertheless take the point. I have heard from Deputies Shortall, Daly, O'Reilly, Kelly, Eamon Ryan and a number of other speakers - I apologise if I left out people - about the importance of getting the right mechanism to get answers. I agree with Deputy Shortall in that I do not want the mechanism to shut down debate in here or in any committee but it must have teeth.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	436	This is critical. There were one or two contributions tonight that were simply wrong, specifically the commentary relating to the Minister. I believe what the Minister is saying but there is a real issue. The Minister is managing a live process. He was told something earlier and he acted on facts over the weekend. This DÃ¡il debated facts that were wrong, and that cannot happen again. The scenario in which the information came to the Minister tells me there is something wrong in the Department and the national screening process at the very least. It tells me there is something wrong if people are afraid to relay such information to the Minister's Department. This cannot happen again because if it does, we will get into a different space and I do not want to go there. This is too serious an issue. The political sideshow must end in the next couple of days because this is a serious matter. The Minister should send an email to everybody in the Department, the HSE and the national screening centre, asking that if people have any information, they should reveal it. It has nearly gone to that. There are 15 people who could not provide the Minister with accurate data over the weekend. I am glad the Minister made those comments about HIQA. What will happen if HIQA is asking questions and requests people to turn up but those people refuse to do so? Nothing happens and the people just do not turn up. They do not answer questions and they are not compelled to do so. Where do we go then? The real issue is that HIQA does not have adequate powers, including power of compellability. It cannot force people to answer questions or attend meetings. People cannot be cross-examined. As a result, we will end up with a commission anyway. I will be helpful. There is a need for a period to scope this and it cannot be open-ended. This is to ensure it could be done quickly. I repeat that we will refuse point blank to support this being done by HIQA.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	437	I appreciate that the Deputy has said this is too serious an issue to play party or personality politics with it. I appreciate the responsible way in which he and his party, along with most Members of the House, are approaching this sensitive matter. I want to work with all people in government and the Opposition in getting answers. I fully endorse the idea that this cannot be an open-ended process or a process that goes on for years. As the Irish Cancer Society indicated to me today, there are some women who have cancer who will be very sick and want answers. We must be conscious of another process, the independent clinical review, which should get under way forthwith. I am not suggesting the Deputy is saying we do not consider this. That review will mean that every woman affected by this can have an appointment with a team of experts brought in internationally, a liaison nurse and the Irish Cancer Society feeding into how best to do that. Those women should be able to find out their own facts and medical detail to know their cases were reviewed. There is a real issue here and there is a reason I declared I did not have confidence in the management of CervicalCheck. The Deputy can imagine how that went down in the system but I could not say anything else. How could I have confidence when the information available to me, the Deputy and the public has been dripping out? That is not acceptable. It is too serious an issue. There is a reason I did not have confidence in the management, and notwithstanding the excellent work Dr. Flannelly did in many ways, there is a reason it was appropriate for her to step aside.

There are 250,000 smear tests every year and if everybody with a concern wants a test, how will the system take it? The Minister has assured us the resources will be there.I know many GPs. How in the name of God will they be able to do that? They are asking those questions tonight. We have to give public assurance by other mechanisms. We have to be practical and realistic. Will the Minister consider instructing that a qualified sampling process be done to give assurances to the women of Ireland and the public? Will he also ensure there is an immediate programme of promotion and media engagement by the appropriate people to address this issue? Please consider the sampling issue. We have got to be realistic and honest with people. There are 250,000 tests a year. This a practical not a political point. Given everybody who is concerned, and they no doubt have concerns, the system cannot take it. Please look at alternatives and take my suggestion on board to give assurances to the public. Statistically, if that comes out at what we expect, it would give the women of Ireland greater assurance.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	444	I appreciate the good faith in which the comment was made. I am not going to decide - the Deputy would not expect me to - quality assurance methods on the floor of the DÃ¡il but I will reflect on his point. Part of the international peer review - whatever the mechanism or structure - which I hope can get to work quickly, will look at how our screening programme compares with results in other countries. That could be of significant help in providing assurance. The Irish Cancer Society, ICS, had some excellent ideas today on how we could provide assurance and information to women. That included the idea of the screening programme writing out to every woman with factual information about the programme, some of the steps taken and probably an apology as well for all the stress and worry caused. I am going to work with the ICS and other advocacy groups on how to best to build that assurance. The Deputy is right. The guidance to the GPs on this issue of repeat smear tests outside of the normal schedule will be issued this week. Before making such an announcement, I discussed it with the IMO and the NAGP, and both welcomed it. I am not speaking for them on the floor of the DÃ¡il but I got a sense from them that they expected many women to turn up in their surgeries anyway. If a woman needed that as part of the reassurance process, then it should be available to her.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	452	I asked the Minister to comment on the statement by the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening. The statement said that for any screening programme to be successful, it must have the trust and confidence of the public and to ensure that confidence is maintained the results of the audit of 2014 must be published. Will the Minister comment on that please? I want to tease out further how the screening is done. It is important. The Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine asked if all the false negative screens were performed in the same laboratory, and I ask that question also. The Taoiseach told us today that three laboratories are involved, namely, the Coombe and two in the United States. However, MedLab Pathology in Sandyford, a sister company of CPL in Texas - the firm Ms Vicky Phelan sued - is given 50% of the samples by CervicalCheck. When I went for my smear about three weeks ago, the doctor was emphatic that it was going to the US.  How is it decided what goes to Sandyford, what goes to the US and what goes to the Coombe? Or where does it go? Can the Minister tell me when it is said that MedLab Pathology "deals with" 50% of the samples, what does "deal with" mean? Does it mean that it actually screens them? Does it do the tests on them or does it just package them and send them in Texas? I refer to Quest Diagnostics in the United States. How is that decided? Is the Minister concerned that MedLab Pathology in Sandyford is the sole laboratory dealing with the bowel screening programme? We should be informed of the connection it has to CPL in Texas. Have I time to ask another quick question?

Mr. O'Brien said he had not dismissed those concerns and that they were taken up in the contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics in the US. Is the Minister happy that is the case? I know we are not going to see the contract given sensitivity and commercial secrecy, etc. Even if I asked for it, I would never see it. However, why did Mr. O'Brien then allow Dr. David Gibbons and several renowned scientists resign as result of him ignoring them? Why did he tell us that he wrote it into the contract before it was awarded?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	455	I am accountable to the House for my role as Minister for Health. I do not have some of the answers nor would I be expected to in respect of some of the questions Deputy BrÃ­d Smith asked. I refer in particular to the awarding of a contract in 2008 by the HSE or the screening programmes. Other witnesses will appear before the Joint Committee on Health tomorrow. They will be much more versed in that than I would be, should be or would be expected to be. I have to clarify an issue. I heard on a number of occasions in recent days a call for me to publish the audit report. That suggests people think there is a report sitting somewhere that needs to be published. My understanding and what I am informed - there is a caveat in that - is that the 2014 audit and, indeed, any of the audits refer to audits of individual women's smear tests as opposed to an audit report. I certainly do not have within my possession, nor does my Department, any audit report or document that could or should be published.

These are individual women's smear tests and individual women have a right to know what is in them. In the last number of days since this came to light I have spent time making sure that individual women know, as they should have known. It is worrying that the paternalistic culture suggested that they were not told even when it was communicated to their treating clinician. I do not have them, nor should I, as they are individual women's smear tests. I will come back in. I will not use the Deputy's time.

However, he has direct responsibility for the concerns that were flagged by Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith and other scientists. They went as far as resigning from the quality assurance committee over this issue. That is not insignificant. They were so concerned about the inferiority of the testing regime that would result from outsourcing it to the United States. They had evidence to back that up. I refer to the view that thtanumber of missed positives would be significantly higher with the outsourcing. Can the Minister tell us they were wrong? That matters not just in respect of the 208 people but in respect of every single person who has been screened and who will be screened. I have been asked to ask the Minister about the retests now being promised to anyone who wants one. Who will do the tests? Will the tests be inferior? I refer to what Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said - he is saying it as we speak - about the problems that have emerged inevitably emerging because of the difference and the mismatch between standards here and in the United States. Can the Minister assure people that they were wrong? The academy that was mentioned, the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine, is saying the whole thing should be repatriated now. Does the Minister agree? Should it be repatriated?

We have to look at all these issues as part of the inquiry. Concerns were clearly raised by eminent people. They are very eminent and far more qualified to speak on this than I am, including Dr. Coulter-Smith. Other views were also raised by other people. There was a process and a robust debate in 2008. A decision was made. However, the Deputy has to be careful in raising these concerns that he is not casting doubts over the success of the programme. It has saved the lives of Irish women. We have seen over 50,000 pre-cancerous cells detected as a result of this programme. We have seen 3 million smears take place.We have seen the mortality rate from cervical cancer decline in this country.

Deputy Boyd Barrett agrees with that aspect of it - I do not mean to be antagonistic about it â yet he is saying that the laboratories to which the samples are being sent are inferior.

CervicalCheck published information on the company's website tonight as follows:Our cervical screening samples are sent to one of three contracted laboratories. One of these in the US and two are in Ireland. The reason we use a US laboratory is because we do not have enough certified laboratories in Ireland.The laboratories are:Quest Diagnostics Inc, Teterboro, New Jersey, USAMedLab Pathology Ltd, Dublin andthe Coombe Women and Infantâs Hospital, Dublin.All three laboratories meet our quality assurance standards and are certified by national authorities. Every sample is checked by at least two screening staff.The laboratories are also accredited to ISO 15189 standard or equivalent. This standard ensures that there are robust quality control procedures in place.The laboratory involved in the case reported in the media, CPL, is not one of the laboratories currently used by CervicalCheck.All of these issues, including the reconfiguration of our laboratories, have been moved to human papillomavirus testing. That is an active issue that should be looked at and will be looked at. We should be careful in raising these concerns that we do not cause widespread fear or panic about a programme that I believe we all support. I appreciate the support of Deputies in this regard.

Let us be absolutely clear: we believe people should avail of that screening programme. Furthermore, anyone who is concerned should immediately seek to be screened. There is no question about that. The issue at stake â to be honest, the Minister knows this â is whether the standard of that screening system was inferior as a result of the decision to outsource it. That fear was well-flagged by eminent people who had evidence. It is not simply that they thought and speculated. They had evidence based on Quest and the fact that in the USA the particular nature of the screening programme meant that 1.2 out of 100 rather than 1.8 out of 100 â the rate achieved here â from the same sample population was the average rate. That means the tests were missing people who had abnormal cells. The difference is one third and that is very serious. Were some of the 208 people victims? Were some of the others to whom the Minister referred in the bombshell that has been dropped tonight victims? Were others who have been tested and who may have had false negatives victims of the fact that we may have a screening system inferior to the system we would have had if we had taken the advice of David Gibbons, Sam Coulter-Smith and the scientists? That is very important. There is a political line of responsibility there. Does the Minister agree that it is very important?

If that contributed to the scandal that has now unfolded, they are accountable. Does the Minister agree with that? That is an important question. Is it not strange? Can the Minister explain this to me? The then Opposition spokesperson, James Reilly, flagged these concerns in the DÃ¡il in 2008. When he got into government, why did he not follow through on it? He expressed in the DÃ¡il exactly the same concerns that Sam Coulter-Smith and David Gibbons had expressed very strongly. When he was appointed Minister, he did absolutely nothing about it. His successor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, did nothing about it. The Minister has done nothing about it.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	503	This is a serious issue and I do not intend to engage in a shouting match on it. Deputy Boyd Barrett should note that there are mistakes and errors made in this country and in many different countries. The Deputy has a viewpoint - others agree with him â that sending this screening service or the reading of the smears to the United States was a mistake. Deputy Boyd Barrett has asked several questions of people who are not here to defend themselves or to explain or account for their policy rationale at the time. The Deputy has accused me of not doing anything in this regard. What I am doing as Minister is taking a decision to introduce HPV testing. That will make us one of the first countries in the world to do this. It will save more lives and reduce false negatives. Moreover, it will provide us with an opportunity to reconfigure our laboratory services - I have said as much several times today â and look at all of it. Second, I am putting forward the legitimate issues, whether I agree with them or disagree with them. I have no reason to believe the standard in the US laboratories is in any way lesser than the standard here. No quality assurance issue has been raised with me by my officials. I am putting all of those questions into a robust international external review so that they can be answered factually rather than what could end up being a tit for tat about different political views on an important matter.

That is true because they had already been diagnosed with cancer. Had that disclosure happened then, the storm we are having now would have happened then prompting the changes and alerts about the possible problems with the tests. In fact, it may have saved other lives and prompted earlier diagnoses of false negatives that may have happened subsequently. Is that not the case?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	508	I think the disclosure of women's health information to women at the earliest possible opportunity would have prevented a great deal of pain, hurt, suffering and worry. I fully agree with that.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	509	The next slot is being shared, I understand, between Deputy Joan Collins, Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Connolly. The slot is 15 minutes. There are questions and answers. At the end of 15 minutes whoever is caught on the dance floor will have to stand down.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	510	These are the issues I raised this morning about outsourcing of the smear testing. We know that in 2008, a total of 300,000 Irish smear tests were sent over to the US firm Quest Diagnostics, and two years later clinical pathology laboratories based in Austin, Texas took over the National Cancer Screening Service. These are for-profit companies. There was a political furore about it at the time. It is not me saying that there is something wrong with the methodology, how it was done or how they were tested. Eminent doctors, including Dr. Gibbons and Sam Coulter-Smith, raised these concerns. They raised them at the time and said that this should not happen. As has been said, they resigned over it. That is a serious matter and it has to be investigated. I commented this morning on the international peer review. At this point the Minister and his team should look into trying to bring the samples back for testing now under the HPV testing scheme that he intends to roll out in October because all of them will have to be checked again. We know they need to be checked twice or three times. We know there is a difference in how people are tested in America compared with here. I call on the Minister to come back on that. It is a serious issue. Although the current Minister for Health was not the Minister with responsibility for health at the time, he is now the Minister for Health and he must deal with these issues.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	511	As Minister for Health, I regularly have to deal with serious issues from the past. I will not be found wanting in terms of working with people to try to deal with these issues. The issues raised by Deputy Joan Collins will be investigated but they will not be investigated by me.They will be investigated by people who have an expertise in this area. They will be investigated by people who come at it from an international perspective and who can look at it in a clinical, factual and evidence-based way. That is one of the purposes of the statutory investigation, that we have something that is not something of the Government, the Department of Health or the Minister for Health but fully external to look at all these issues, including the use of laboratories. The Deputy made the point, and I appreciate her making it, that the human papilloma virus, HPV, testing will provide an opportunity to look at how we reconfigure our laboratory services in this country. It will also necessitate, as she would know, because of the expenditure of public money, a new tender, so there will be opportunities for all these issues not only to be revisited but also to be retendered. I am also happy to keep the House updated as that progresses.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	512	If in the review it is found out that this outsourcing was the potentially the cause of the cases not being properly checked, and we know that Vicky Phelan won an award of â¬2.5 million from a US based laboratory, will the Minister demand answers of the people of the day who made those decisions?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	513	I cannot be judge and jury here. The Deputy asked a question as to what a review or an investigation may find. We need an investigation into the breadth of issues regarding our screening programme, and we are going to have one. I think many people acted in good faith at that time. I think many people had different views. From my reading over the last while, and I have been reading a lot about this in recent days, I think a lot of people had different views. It was clearly quite controversial and well debated. However, it is important to say, and I know the Deputy backed the screening programme, that there is no evidence to suggest that the results people are getting back from that laboratory today are more inferior than the results that they would be getting from the laboratory in Dublin. I would like to see home-grown laboratory services.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	516	Sure.

When was it decided to assess that and move to the new system and what was the basis of that reassessment?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	518	That was a very brief question.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	519	They will all be brief.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	520	I am getting my note on that. I decided to introduce it in February of this year, following on from a Health Insurance and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment, HTA, which recommended to me that it could reduce the number of false negatives for Irish women.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	521	We know it is a matter of public record that the Taoiseach has said he changed his position on mandatory open disclosure on the basis of the advice of his officials. The Minister also has received similar advice, as have I. That advice was against best international practice and evidence. When we asked the Department and the Chief Medical Officer when we met him what was the evidence against mandatory open disclosure and the implication that it would lead to fewer disclosures, there was no evidence, and that was admitted. Given that the Minister and his predecessor have been sent out to act on bad advice, what will the Minister do to call to account the Chief Medical Officer and the chief executive officer of the HSE?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	522	I do not think how the Deputy has represented the Chief Medical Officer's advice is how I would recall it, but perhaps we can pursue that some other time. We in the Department of Health and, more importantly, the Government - as indicated in the programme for Government - are fully committed to the introduction of mandatory open disclosure. I have already acknowledged that the Deputy has done Trojan work in this regard, and we will move forward with the patient safety Bill. I will bring it to Government for permission to draft next Tuesday, and I will work with the assistance of Members of this House to get it passed as a matter of urgency. It is one of the most practical things we can do for the people who are wondering why they were not told about this by their doctor.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	523	The Minister was sent out with that advice but it could have been brought in before now. In terms of litigation, the Minister will be aware that outstanding liability claims against the State for 2016 amount to â¬2.2 billion. Some 87% of those liabilities rest with the HSE and Tusla, an amount of approximately â¬1.9 billion in terms of claims. It is patently obvious that litigation and the manner in which the State Claims Agency is operating is a huge factor in what has happened here and what has happened in other cases. Given the comments that were made earlier about the request to ask the Attorney General to settle cases without further litigation, how can the Minister stand over that in this instance and yet another arm of the State is actively defending cases in regard to the prescribing of Lariam, whereby not only is it defending the cases and adopting the exact same tactic but it is also continuing to prescribe that drug? What plans has the Government to deal with this whole area of litigation, how it informs itself on other legislative provision and the impact that this has had on open disclosure?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	524	This is an important area on which my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I are working together. We have already taken a number of steps, including, with the Minister and his Department, the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which provides for the use of pre-action protocols in clinical negligence actions, the Mediation Act 2017, which promotes mediation as an efficient alternative to court proceedings, and the much-debated Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which gives the court the option to make periodic payment orders for catastrophically injured plaintiffs. I note the State Claims Agency tells me that it settles 98% of clinical negligence actions out of court. The Deputy has raised an important issue. The State Claims Agency plays a very important role in this State and it plays an important role on behalf of all the agencies and Departments of the State. The action the Taoiseach has taken is prudent in this regard, namely, to ask the Attorney General to do a body of work with the State Claims Agency to examine if there is a better way in regard to this case to make sure women can get access to the information and the support they need without needing to go to court. I hope also that the independent clinical review I am putting in place will help women get factual information without the need to go to court.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	525	None of those Acts and actions the Minister has taken have addressed the fundamental structural issues behind that. While I note some of the concerns of other Deputies about the HIQA inquiry, I am not necessarily opposed to it. However, I absolutely believe that if we are going to get to the bottom of this that we need something along the lines of the Cartwright inquiry in New Zealand. If the Minister does not know about it now, I ask him to look into it. It came off the back of a cervical cancer scandal and they took the whole system and changed the whole way they did business regarding particularly issues relating to women's reproductive health and they provided for individual input into the process. There are huge lessons to be learned there. I would like the Minister to give a commitment that he will examine that model - it is "Yes" or "No" answer in some ways - and also the Dutch model where we know an Irish woman was misdiagnosed in regard to cervical cancer in the Netherlands. However, the approach that state took was radically different from that taken here, and litigation hardly exists in the Netherlands.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	526	I appreciate the constructive and reasonable approach the Deputy has taken to the HIQA inquiry. We all want to get to the answers quickly but we also want to make sure that we have a mechanism that can get to all the answers and the full ambit of them. We have had a useful beginning of the teasing out of this tonight. I hope after the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health tomorrow, at which Members will have an opportunity to question officials and to fill in other important pieces in terms of information, we could then have engagement with the Opposition. I would be happy to do that. I will look into what the Deputy has referred to in New Zealand. We always look to international reviews if they there can be learning from them. I will look at that overnight.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	527	I will preface my comments by saying that in the 1960s, Galway had the first cytology service. In 1999, it was chosen as the laboratory to implement the first phase of cervical screening. We had an excellent service in Galway until it was deliberately run down. I also sat on a health forum. I remember distinctly at the time that I and my colleagues raised the most serious concerns about Quest Diagnostics, with which the Minister has reassured us tonight that there is no difficulty. We had the most serious concerns about the outsourcing. My question is : how many other cases are there arising from this audit or any other audit in regard to cervical cancer? How many other cases are ongoing or have been settled?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	528	I am certainly not saying there are no difficulties with anything in this regard. I am factually letting the Members know the information that I have as I have it, in the interests of full disclosure. Regarding that issue, working out the number of other cases, if any, is under way as is looking to see if there are cases that could potentially come down the tracks that we could avoid. The Attorney General and the State Claims Agency are working on that. I am happy to engage with the House once I have that information.

How many cases have been initiated? How many cases have been settled? How many have been subject to confidentiality clauses?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	530	I am very conscious of not putting information on the record of the DÃ¡il that I cannot stand over. My officials do not seem to have a recollection of any other case similar to this one that has been settled, but I would suggest that we could more wholesomely answer the question with officials at the Joint Committee on Heath. We will have to engage with the State Claims Agency to get the full details on that. I am very happy to share it with Deputy Connolly.

He is telling me he is not aware.He should be informed. The Minister should be told what cases are in being, what cases have been settled and what confidential clauses arise.

The NTMA is the State body which operates with a commercial remit to provide asset and liability management services to Government and it is designated as the State Claims Agency when it is performing claims and risk management functions. The NTMA reports directly to the Minister for Finance in the performance of its State Claims Agency functions. Under the NTMA Act - this is important - the management of claims relating to the clinical negligence arising in State authorities is delegated to the State Claims Agency. As I have said, the State Claims Agency informed me that-----

I also feel for and sympathise with all the front-line staff who work in hospitals and give their very best to patients when they come in to be seen, whether they be nurses, doctors and front-line staff. I am disappointed with the HSE. People right across the country have lost their confidence in it. When a full and thorough investigation is carried out, will the Minister do something with the managers responsible, many of whom are getting big money? Will the Minister fire them or will they just get bigger pensions when they come to retiring? That is the question I am asking.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	608	I cannot comment on the record of the DÃ¡il about any individual's contract or pension entitlement. Such matters are set out in law.

Obviously, I cannot say that. What I will do - I think I have shown a determination to do so this week - is call it as I see it. I will share every bit of information I have with this House. I will work with the Opposition to establish whatever structures should be established to get to the bottom of this and I expect all officials, including in the HSE, to appear before the relevant Oireachtas committees and answer the many questions that require answers.

#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	613	Could the Minister tell me what is the reporting relationship between CervicalCheck, the HSE and the Department of Health and what is the chain of responsibility which led CervicalCheck to advise the treating doctor that it was at his or her discretion to make an open disclosure?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	614	First, I thank Deputy Harty for convening a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health so quickly tomorrow. That is an important forum to have. I was just clarifying the structure there. CervicalCheck reports to the National Screening Service, which reports into the National Cancer Control Programme which reports, to the best of my knowledge, to the chief clinical officer of the HSE who is the national director. I apologise but I did not hear the Deputy's second question.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	615	The other part of that question was: what is the chain of responsibility within CervicalCheck which led it to indicate to the treating physician that it was at his or her discretion to make a disclosure?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	616	I can only rely on what I have read so far. Clearly, the clinical director of CervicalCheck was in correspondence with clinicians on what they should or should not do in regard to some of the audits. The clinical director seemed to have a liaison with other clinicians around the country but it is my initial understanding that the review needs to make that clear.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	617	Could the Minister tell me why the action against the HSE was struck out in the court in Ms Vicky Phelan's case and what was the HSE's defence in that case?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	618	I truthfully cannot. All I can tell the Deputy in regard to the case - the only information I have on it - is the information note that I received on 16 April that I have published. That is the full extent of the information that I have, other than what I have learned, in the same way the Deputy has, in regard to discovery documents and, obviously, the public commentary of Ms Phelan and others. I cannot provide the Deputy with any further information on that simply because I do not have it.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	619	Can the Minister tell me what is the legal position of all those who have had false negatives and have not been informed?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	620	There are two distinct issues. Deputy Harty, as a doctor, will appreciate there is obviously the fact that any screening programme will always have a number of false negatives and false positives. The issue I am concerned about is when individual women's cases were audited - we should talk about when individual audits of women's screenings were carried out rather than in the sense of a global audit - and that information came to the fore and why that information was not shared with the women. What I want to do is find a mechanism whereby we can: first, provide them with all the factual information, which I expect they would have had; second, provide them with an appointment with their clinician; and third, provide them with access to an international clinical panel that can objectively review their case, meet the woman and be co-ordinated by a liaison nurse. The Taoiseach, as he outlined in this House today, has asked the Attorney General to consider how we can best look at helping that cohort of women and I expect further developments in regard to that as we further establish the facts.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	621	In regard to the outsourcing of testing, surely it makes sense that in a country this size we could provide in-house testing. Rather than spending considerable amounts sending samples abroad, surely we should be testing our cervical smears here in Ireland, thereby creating a bank of knowledge but also keeping the money in Ireland that is going abroad for these tests.It makes perfect sense that there should be several laboratories in Ireland capable of providing these tests.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	622	Instinctively I agree with the Deputy. I would like to see our own laboratories develop and be able to provide these services. I was not around in the political sphere, nor was Deputy Harty, in 2008 when these decisions were made. My understanding from reading back through the debate at the time is there was a view we did not have the capacity in the country. I note from CervicalCheck's website today, in the frequently asked questions it published, that it maintains the view we would not have adequate capacity in this country. It is not to say it should not be stress-tested, examined and looked at in the context of how we reorganise our lab services when we move to the HPV testing later this year which will, I am informed, result in the requirement for a new tender. I am informed, based on CervicalCheck's public information and from reading back on the debates at the time, that there was a view we did not have the capacity. Others would argue we did and it was run down but that is the advice given to me.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	623	I salute the extraordinary courage of Vicky Phelan and all the women and families who have been dragged unwillingly into a scandal of enormous dimensions. As Deputy Healy-Rae and others said, I salute the front-line workers who are doing heroic work in the HSE and hospitals and everywhere else every day. It is an cÃ©ad lÃ¡ Bealtaine. In five days' time, the Minister will be two years in the job. He will have his pension entitlements, as will new Ministers. They are sticking like mud to a blanket to get their pensions and then the Government could fall apart. Does the Minister not accept the HSE is a totally dysfunctional, unaccountable and unmanageable outfit? Will the Minister give me his answer on that?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	624	One day when I am not in the middle of trying to sort out a very serious health crisis that is worrying women right up and down the length and breadth of this country, I will come back and debate my record on women's health with the Deputy anywhere and at any time, and I look forward to that opportunity. Today my priority, rather than scoring political points, is trying to establish the facts, provide the support and build a better screening service. There is an awful lot of work we need to do in the health service. We have discussed it in the House many times and we will continue to discuss it. Deputy Shortall has shown leadership on this regarding the SlÃ¡intecare report. I am working on an implementation plan to get it to Government. Tonight is not a night for me to debate my record in the Department of Health or Deputy McGrath's view of it or for me to debate the Deputy's policy positions. There will be plenty of time for that. Tonight is a night for addressing the concerns facing the women of Ireland.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	625	I reject that. Is the Minister going to wait until there are another 17 dead? Is he going to wait on the people dying on trolleys? It is not an answer; it is a cop-out. Deputy Harris is the Minister. The Government has collective responsibility under the seal of office handed to it by the President. The Government has to take some kind of action and not just give pipsqueak answers like that to score political points. I am not scoring political points. It does not give me any joy to have a 14-year-old child languishing on a children's ward for 11 weeks when she needs psychiatric treatment. The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is meeting us tomorrow. There are other cases up and down the country. The lads behind me, Deputy Michael Collins, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae are bringing bus loads up to Belfast to stop them from going blind. It cannot be done here. It is dysfunctional beyond the extreme. Any right-thinking person or second-class student would know it is not working. Earlier today, the highly respected journalist, Gemma O'Doherty, who has done much to highlight corruption in the State issued a Tweet saying:It has now emerged 162 women were NOT told their smear test results were wrong. 17 have died. @FineGael are ta[l]king about an enquiry. A functioning democracy with a decent [self-respect or moral compass and a functioning] police force would be talking about manslaughter, reckless endangerment, and imminent arrests.We have become a banana republic. They can do what they like, people will die and the Minister will wring his hands and say he is not scoring political points. He is not fit for his job, he is not doing it and he has not done it. Will he resign?

Will the Minister sack Tony O'Brien? How many more scandals must he be involved in? He is going off in July with his big pension. He has a track record with the family planning agencies where there was no investigation into the blackguarding that went on there. He got a green light to go forward. The Minister wants to go out and canvass with Mr. Colm O'Gorman when he owes money to the State. He refuses to give back money. He is a law-breaker. It is okay for the Minister to go with him. I say to the Minister, as Cromwell said, to hell or to Connacht with the Minister because the people will do it anyway. Will the Minister sack him and will he go with him?

Last week we saw a brave woman, Vicky Phelan, who has been diagnosed as being terminally ill with cervical cancer being dragged through the courts to fight for her right to get the truth. Vicky Phelan had a smear test in 2011 that showed no abnormalities. While a later review found this was incorrect, the information was kept from Vicky Phelan for almost three years. In the court case, the State and laboratory used all their resources to fight against the brave woman and her family. This unfortunately shows how our State deals with vulnerable people. It is almost 20 years since the contaminated blood scandal became known and our State fully defended itself against these people, some of whom were on their death beds. Are there any other concerns with BreastCheck, cervical screening or bowel screening? Does the Minister have any concerns?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	635	Deputy Collins raises a very important point about making sure when we are looking at the CervicalCheck programme that we also look at the implications for any other screening programme. I thank the Deputy for raising that important issue. Deputy Donnelly raised it with me yesterday. We will include in the scope of any review or investigation that we carry out, an examination of the implications for other screening programmes.

The information the Minister gave tonight is that all those cases have not been audited. Where did that information come from? Perhaps the Deputy mentioned it earlier. I may not have picked it up. Where did the information come from? How accurate is it?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	637	I did answer it earlier but I am more than happy to answer it again because it is a very important question. I was advised by the Chief Medical Officer very shortly before I came into the Chamber this evening that the work of the serious incident management team, SIMT, the team that has been based in CervicalCheck looking through all of this issue, looking through the audits and ascertaining whether women had or had not been told, had come across this. It is the situation whereby all of the cases that CervicalCheck knew about - all of the cases of cancer - have been audited. That is where we get the 208 figure - it is the 208 where there was an issue raised and whether those women were told or not told. Those figures are now a matter of public record. The issue is whether there are other cases of cervical cancer in the national cancer registry which had not been notified to CervicalCheck. The information provided to me by the SIMT tonight is that there are and there are likely to be a considerable number. This does not mean there are people sitting at home or anywhere else who did not know they had cancer. They are cervical cancer patients, people who have been treated or diagnosed with cervical cancer, but who never had the audit process because they were never part of the cervical check. Deputy Harty is a doctor and I am not. Some of them may not have had a screening history and some may have. That is the extent of the information I know. I expect it to be a considerable number of people and I expect the SIMT to be able to make significant progress on putting more information into the public domain very quickly. I am conscious that many of the relevant officials will be at the committee tomorrow.

My understanding is the HSE estimates that 3,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer over the past ten years. What about the remaining 1,500 women? Is the Minister saying those remaining 1,500 women have not had their screening history audited?

I think we all had the view when we got up this morning that every case of cervical cancer in the cancer registry had been notified to CervicalCheck but that is not the case, based on information given to me before I came in here a few hours ago. I have been here since and have not been able to secure further information. I expect it to be a considerable number. I do not disagree with the Deputy's mathematics for the number of people diagnosed with cervical cancer but I am reluctant to give out information that I simply do not have.

It is not enough for the Minister just to say he is setting up an inquiry. Apart from the women who have been diagnosed with cancer, we are all very conscious of the thousands of women around the country who are very nervous about this and are beginning to question the validity of smear tests they have had. The Minister has given some assurance to people about services being available and retests. It was brought to my attention this evening that a person who made contact with CervicalCheck in order to arrange a rescreening of a smear received a message from the CervicalCheck website thanking her for her email and saying rescreening will be available and that it is currently assessing the impact of the Minister's announcement regarding rescreening for clients of the CervicalCheck programme. Further information on the implementation of this announcement will be provided in due course via the CervicalCheck website.  Would the Minister agree that response from CervicalCheck is completely unacceptable?

We will set this up shortly and will post details on cervicalcheck.ie as soon as possible.Please bear in mind that cervical screening tests cannot be repeated within three months, to allow cells to grow back and to get the best samples, so you must wait a minimum of three months if you have had a recent cervical screening.To reassure the person who has contacted the Deputy, the HSE's GP clinical adviser, Dr. David Hanlon, has been in contact with GP representative bodies. I expect the practicalities of how that will work to be posted on the CervicalCheck website this week.  I am sure the Deputy did not mean it when she referred to my simply setting up an inquiry and saying that is that, or words to that effect, that is certainly not what I am saying. Democratic accountability and the work of the Oireachtas committees, this Chamber and anywhere else should continue, and I will continue to give all the information I have when I have it. I will engage with the Deputy and her grouping, and others and their parties, on how best to put a structure in place to get these answers.

That response needs to change rapidly. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was passed last November. A key provision of the Bill was to force doctors to tell patients about mistakes that had been made but the Government introduced an amendment to make this voluntary rather than mandatory. The Minister for Justice and Equality recognised the input of his colleague, the Minister for Health, in changing that from mandatory to voluntary. Now, the Minister is committing to introducing mandatory disclosure. What has changed in the meantime and why did he think it was alright last November to suggest that he would water this down and move from mandatory to voluntary?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	649	I am fully committed to open disclosure. A patient should always have a right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication. That is already underpinned in the medical practitioners' code of conduct which is not exactly a flimsy document but I accept it does not happen on the ground and we have seen that in recent days. The idea was that in a Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 we would deal with a voluntary open disclosure underpinned in legislation for all instances within the health service but the Minister for Justice and Equality said in the House, and I did say explicitly and in correspondence to Deputy Clare Daly last November, that we would proceed to mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable incidents and I have clarified now that will absolutely include screening.

I am shocked that the 162 women at the centre of this scandal have not all been contacted. I expected after the Minister set up the expert group that those women would be contacted by Friday last. The number is 162 which should be a manageable number to make contact with. I cannot believe that five days later those women have not all been contacted. How many have not yet been contacted and can the Minister give us an assurance that tomorrow at the very latest they will all be engaged with?

Does he think that would work best in conjunction with the HIQA inquiry or following it? What type of vehicle does he think would be most appropriate for that type of investigation?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	654	I see validity in a HIQA inquiry. It has a track record, has built up significant expertise and has statutory underpinning. Under section 9(2) of the Health Act 2007 it has done a lot of good work, when it had those "teeth", for example, on the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, and the death of Savita Halappanavar. In respect of Portlaoise it not only produced a report but was then able to prove that, as a result of the report, maternity services were safer and better in the hospital. It has demonstrated great independence and an ability to do the work. I am not, however, closing my mind to what other Deputies are suggesting in good faith. We should work on a cross-party basis in this respect. If there are concerns about broader issues or problems that cannot be captured by HIQA we should tease them out. That is particularly so in light of the fact that new information has come into the public domain this evening. It is important that we do that. I am open to discussing the sequence and what the different pieces may look like. I want to make sure we can get answers to all the questions that are legitimately being raised here. We could have some very useful engagement on this perhaps as early as tomorrow.

The point was made yesterday that the US one-year testing system is different from our three-year system. Does the Minister believe that is of consequence up to now, or to the quality of screening we were using?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	656	I am informed by the Department that in the US a one-year smear is recommended but that is because it does not have an organised population-based health programme like ours. Many people in the US can be screened too often. It is similar to what happened here in the bad old days before we had a population-based programme, with some people being screened too often and some not screened often enough. I appreciate the responsible way in which the Deputy asked the question. All of the laboratories being used are accredited and no quality assurance issue has been brought to my attention on that. That is important for women who are wondering tonight where their screen will be read. We can have a broader debate about the appropriateness of where it should be read but in terms of quality assurance that is an important message.

Has he had a chance to read the 46 where patients were informed? What characterised the different approaches, whereby a limited number of patients were given the history of the audit as against the 162 who were not? Is there any trend or pattern as to why some were informed and others were not?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	658	I have no access to that information. It is a question we could usefully explore. Why did some doctors decide they should tell the women and others put it on the file.When the serious incident management team was sent into CervicalCheck there was an expectation that the majority of doctors would have disclosed. I recall saying publicly in those days that expectation was not good enough in light of the Vicky Phelan case but still the expectation was that most doctors would have disclosed. This is clearly not the case and it raises serious questions about what I am concerned is a paternalistic culture in regard to information between women and their doctors. We need to get to the bottom of this and while open disclosure is important there are other issues we need to get into, including accountability.

I do not want the priority of my energies or, I would suggest, all of our energies to be placed in who should leave their job now. There is a time and place in regard to accountability. I want the priority in CervicalCheck to be on getting the answers, getting the information, contacting the women and getting the guidance up on how GPs could administer the repeat smear tests. There is a huge body of work that needs to be done in the coming hours and days and it is on this work I want the energies of CervicalCheck to be focused. I cannot currently express confidence. How can I? I came into this House tonight with new information that took Deputy Healy and I, and the whole country, by surprise. I cannot currently offer blank confidence cheques for people.

I am sure it will come out in the review that we could have had a situation where doctors were replacing information on files to be given to a woman at her next appointment but given the lapse of such a serious period of time, clearly women were not told that information and this is not acceptable to anyone. I would like mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable incidents to become the law of the land. This is one of the practical things we can do as an Oireachtas, thus saying to Vicky Phelan and others never again will they not be told their information or, if they are not, it will be an offence. I will seek permission at Cabinet next Tuesday to draft that Bill. I have removed this measure from a larger Bill in the hope of getting priority drafting and, with the co-operation of Members of this House, having it passed as a priority.

It is unacceptable that the Minister would be provided with late information by whomever is accountable. I praise Vicky Phelan for her courage, conviction and determination. Our hearts go out to her and her family for the battle she is fighting in terms of her health and to all of the women of this country. The key message from Vicky Phelan is that cervical smear testing should continue. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been listening. New, more reliable tests are to be made available to women. I welcome the commitment to mandatory open disclosure, which is essential at this time. I support the Minister in his view that he could not express confidence in the clinical director. It is right that she resigned. I believe that the Department is not responding adequately to this crisis. Does the Minister need additional staff? Are there sufficient staff in the Department to ensure that when crises like this arise, there is a commitment to providing the Minister with all of the facts in regard to any possible questions he could be asked? A Minister should never have to come into this House to read a statement to the effect that new information has come to light which indicates that there are an undetermined number of women who may be in difficult positions over the next few days. I would like now to speak about the question of the legal case. In this regard, I want to give an example of a person who suffered greatly at the hands of HIQA and the HSE, in respect of which his family is now going before the courts. A lady named Mary rang HIQA five years ago to complain about the state in which she found her brother in Cherry Orchard Hospital. He had a disability and he had a stroke and she found him strapped to a toilet covered in faeces. Later, her brother, David, died in a Dublin hospital, having been admitted there in such an appalling physical condition that the admitting doctor attacked the family for not having cared for him properly. The doctor was surprised when he was told that the man had been under the tender care of the HSE. The family fought tooth and nail to get an inquiry into his death. The HSE set up an inquiry but as there was no doctor involved the family rejected it. A second inquiry was set up but the doctor involved left mid-inquiry. He refused to finish the investigation he was appointed to carry out. There were then discussions, to which I was party, on the establishment of another inquiry to be undertaken by a specialist team from Scotland. The third inquiry involved Irish experts. Following on from that inquiry, the HSE accepted responsibility for what had happened to this man. What happened then? Nothing. This family now has to resort to the courts system to get justice for their family member. This is appalling and disgraceful. There are other people who have been wronged by the HSE and the health services in respect of which the HSE has admitted responsibility but is not being held accountable. As in the case of Vicky Phelan, these people are being forced to go through the courts system. This is appalling. I spoke to the family this evening. For five years they have been fighting for justice with no success. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, must come together and insist that in cases where there has been an admission of liability, people are not put through this appalling situation.  This debate has been very worthwhile for the people listening in.

Will the Minister make that written information available to Members as it could be important to the debate? Vicky Phelan's courage in the face of deception of the worst kind by the HSE is nothing short of amazing. All women who have been affected must receive the best care possible. Trust on any issue is hard won and in this case the HSE has lost the trust of the women in the State. The concept of screening the population for potentially life threatening disease was forward thinking. Who, however, can trust a system when those responsible for running it have deceived patients and dragged them through the courts? Those within the HSE who are responsible should be ashamed of themselves. We must be very clear in this House tonight that no other women should have to enter into a legal battle with the HSE to get the truth about their medical records.

I wish to put on the record that she has done the women of Ireland a most heroic service. Ten years ago in this House I stated my concerns, on behalf of Sinn FÃ©in, about the process of privatising cervical cancer screening tests. That concern, unfortunately, rings true today and with the most distressing of consequences for so many women. Questions remain and I would like them answered for the record. At which laboratory or laboratories were these screenings misread? I heard the Minister's comments earlier in this regard but I disagree with him. If these tests, or a significant number, are specific to one particular laboratory, then serious consideration should be given to ceasing any contractual arrangement with that entity. I had intended to ask the Minister if we are absolutely at the end of this scandal and if he could clarify, without any ambiguity or doubt, if the 208 cases that had been identified will not increase in number. The Minister has now told us it is likely that it will increase. Who knew this and did not inform the Minister - as he has said - until shortly before he came into the House this evening? Who knew that information? The Minister, Deputy Harris, has indicated that he was made aware of the then impending scandal on 16 April. The State still callously forced Ms Phelan to attend a court hearing to defend herself. How could those in the employ of the Minister and the State have been so cruel? Why was a stop not put to that immediately? I put it to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and Members of the Government who are in the Chamber, that I am tired of coming here to listen to litanies of "Sorry" to victims of scandals. "Sorry" is not good enough anymore. People want to know what is going to be done about it. People are listening to hear who is going to be held responsible. Somebody must be made accountable or else, assuredly, we will find ourselves back here once again responding to yet another tragic episode in the State's disgraceful relationship with the women of Ireland.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	672	I had misunderstood the speaking situation this evening. I thought we would still be able to ask questions, but obviously it is statements at this stage. The fundamental issue that goes to the core of the matter is the withholding of vital information. Why was Ms Phelan's doctor not told of the mistake with her case until 2016? The audit had identified that the issue took place in 2014. A key question is who took the decision to withhold this vital piece of information for two years. This is the nub of the issue. Who made the decision to allow Vicky Phelan to walk around for two years thinking she was cancer free when she could have been undergoing treatment? This is a simple question but it goes to the core of the issue. The note received by the Minister from the HSE, which I am sure the HSE never expected to be circulated publicly, is an absolute insult to the Minister for Health. The note informed the Minister of the 2011 falsely reported negative screening test. The note informed the Minister that a routine screening in 2014 detected high grade abnormalities and that the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014. Why did the note not inform the Minister that neither Vicky Phelan nor her doctor were told of this diagnosis until 2016? The note to the Minister told him certain specifics but it left out the fundamental issues. The note never alluded to the other 207 cases that had emerged. I am stunned by this note. What is not included in the note is as important as what was included. The note then had the audacity to suggest a quote for the Minister of Health about Vicky Phelan who has a terminal illness due to inaction by the HSE and by withholding information. The quote suggested by the HSE for use by the Minister was: "I acknowledge the severe distress that this issue has caused to the patient involved, and to her family." This is cold comfort to Vicky Phelan, to her husband, to her two children and to her extended family. This cold culture of secrecy and the arrogant and unfeeling attitude in the HSE will have to change. It is absolutely sickening that Vicky Phelan was dragged through the courts because of the HSE's inadequacies.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	673	The deaths have occurred of 17 women because they were given the all-clear following smear tests for cervical cancer checks. Since last Saturday some 8,000 women have contacted the HSE helpline because of these deaths. Out of the 17 women who died, 15 did not know of the misdiagnoses. As with other issues such as the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries and the hepatitis C scandal, the 208 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer should have received earlier intervention. Of these women, 162 were not notified that an internal review of their cases had been carried out by CervicalCheck. They should have been told and they had a right to know. Vicky Phelan was one of these women. It is because of her courage that we are finding out what has happened. I pay tribute to her. I am delighted that the Minister has confirmed that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, will conduct an independent inquiry into these women being given the all-clear results. They need answers. CervicalCheck began in 2008 and more than 3 million smear tests have been performed. This has led to some 50,000 treatments for pre-cancerous cells. We must review all screening programmes regularly. Screening is the best way to detect cervical cancer. The screening programme has saved the lives of many women and we must reassure women that it is essential they continue to attend to have their smear tests. Vicky Phelan has said that she wants women to continue to go for cervical smear tests. It is very important that women get their smear test results and also the results of their back reviews. Appropriate treatment of pre-cancerous changes to cells prevents 90% of all cervical cancers, as evidenced by a 7% decrease per year in cervical cancer in Ireland. Five times more women would die from cervical cancer if we did not have a cervical cancer screening programme. The cancer screening programmes, offered through the HSE National Screening Service, aim to detect cancer as early as possible, leading to better treatment options and outcomes for patients.

Others say that doctors differ and patients survive. The core issue is that the public, the women of Ireland and, indeed, this House deserve answers in respect of this saga. Deputy Donnelly spoke about the need for clearer communication. I have no doubt that, in her humility and suffering, Vicky Phelan would like us to seek solutions in order to ensure that solutions will be found to the problems that have arisen in respect of smear tests. Is the Minister in a position to give new confidence to the ordinary women of Ireland? Can he reassure the House not only that the rescreening will be offered to all women involved but also that, particularly for those who are concerned, current smear test samples will be the subject of retests, and that there will be clear individual timelines in this regard. What steps will he take to ensure that the results of medical tests - whether smear tests or others - and what is often described as bad news for patients will be conveyed truthfully in the context of all diagnoses, and that this will be enshrined in a patients' charter of rights?

We must commend the bravery of Vicky Phelan. Even in her recent interviews, she mentions her determination to keep fighting this terminal disease. We wish her the best. One of the issues is the need for mandatory disclosures. We, as legislators, should set about dealing with that matter as soon as possible.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	704	There are 113,790 women in my county, Kildare, and I know that every one of them stands with me as I speak here in solidarity with the brave, tenacious and courageous Vicky Phelan, who has done the State and the women of the State some service in uncovering this horrific scandal. We cannot begin to imagine how Vicky and her family feel, with the fact that her lifetime is potentially being cut in half. It is completely unacceptable that she and her family have had to go to the courts to uncover information which should have been provided to them as soon as it came to light. Their treatment by the State has been shameful and deplorable. We all need to know why Vicky's doctor was not told of the mistake in her case until 2016, even though that mistake was uncovered in 2014. We need to know who took that decision to withhold this vital information for two years. We need to know why information was withheld from families of patients who passed away from cancer. The CEO of the HSE said yesterday that he knew nothing about this case until he read details relating to it on the RTÃ News website. We need to know who in the HSE knew about this matter. I understand that the HSE has received 6,000 calls in the past two days. Many women are very concerned. Many women who cannot get through to the helpline have contacted me. The helpline is ringing out. There is much concern. We need to help, support and reassure women with their concerns. I welcome the move to set up an independent investigation into the CervicalCheck scandal. We need full disclosure. The news that, following an audit of 208 cases, more than 17 women have died is truly shocking. That over three quarters of the 208 women whose cases have been examined by this audit were not told they had delayed diagnosis is scandalous. The issue that the Minister raised tonight, that an audit was not carried out in 1,518 cases, is appalling. There can be no more secrecy. We need full disclosure.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	705	I have a couple of quick points. I thought there would be questions but that will not be the case. The Minister can take them as questions and come back to the House later. Why is the State not paying the â¬8,500 every three weeks for Vicky Phelan's treatment? She is doing that out of her own pocket or the goodwill of friends and family through a GoFundMe page. We need to do something about that. My second question relates to GP surgeries. I know from a family involved in that area that surgeries are being inundated with recheck requests. If somebody had a smear test this morning, yesterday or last week, is it going to the same laboratory in America? If it is and it was me, I would be a bit apprehensive. The problem is clearly with the laboratories. Before we even start the investigation, we know that a good proportion of the problem lies there. How can we give people confidence? I am of the view that the Minister needs to make a statement to the effect that one third of the activity is in the Coombe and the other two thirds are elsewhere. Are tests still being sent to the same laboratory with which there was a problem? I heard a statement from the State Claims Agency on "Morning Ireland" earlier with which I fundamentally disagree because it is not borne out by the facts. The agency was referring to the level of compassion shown to patients and that it is fully understanding of this in the context in which legal fees are pursued. That is nonsense. We all know that the State Claims Agency's default position is to throw people under the bus, to use taxpayers' money and to throw good money after bad. That is borne out in media reports from earlier today which indicate that a child born in 2009 has been awarded a settlement of â¬9 million. How many years has the family involved had to suffer in order to obtain that settlement? This is nothing new. We need different protocols for how we approach claims from the point of view of the State, whether in the context of a health issue or otherwise. While the State cannot be an easy target, we cannot throw good money after bad just because we blindly say that the State is right. There is no compassion in doing so and that is why I do not agree with the statement this morning. I do not care who was Minister with responsibility for health in 2000 or who has served in that capacity in between. We all know there were four or five from different parties. Irrespective of what is going to happen at a prospective inquiry, I ask that an examination be carried out in respect of all emails relating to this matter - from each Minister to each Minister and relating to CervicalCheck - in order that we might discover who knew what and when. I have no interest in going up the hill in two weeks' time against a former Minister or the current incumbent because certain issues may come to light. Let us have that matter examined now, get the information out there and see where we stand.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	706	I thank the Minister for his replies so far about this concerning issue and for the swift explanation of the facts. I am sure he is aware that many women are seriously concerned and are seeking clarification from public representatives in respect of a wide range of issues. All of these women are suffering as a result of the uncertainty that exists. Will the Minister outline how many of university hospitals throughout the country are involved. It has been mentioned in the media that Sligo is one of the hospitals affected. That has given rise to more concern among women in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and their counterparts in Donegal. Would the Minister agree that despite the good work those responsible for this fiasco may have done in the past, they need to be brought to book by the State in order that real accountability can be restored within the HSE? Although the clinical director of CervicalCheck has since stood down, there are definitely more individuals in the various management structures who need to consider their positions.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	707	I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for contributing to this constructive and very important debate and questions and answers session. Regardless of any statutory or other inquiry that we set up, it is very important that the women of Ireland saw that the Oireachtas has spent so many hours rightly discussing this issue in a constructive fashion to determine how the facts will be established, how a better screening programme will be delivered, how we will get answers for the women who need and deserve them, and how we will ensure accountability in that regard. I assure the House of my determination to work with Members on all sides of the House to devise the best possible mechanism to get the answers the women of this country need and deserve in the most expeditious manner possible. The Joint Committee on Health will tomorrow have an opportunity to scrutinise in detail several of these issues with representatives of my Department, the HSE, the national cancer control programme and CervicalCheck. It is an important opportunity as we continue our work as an Oireachtas. I hope that, thereafter, we can have a cross-grouping bipartisan engagement on how to ensure that we have a statutory inquiry which can get answers in a quick and expeditious manner while also having enough of an ambit or remit to address all necessary issues. I wish to end as I began, by thanking Vicky Phelan for her courage. However, I know that she does not want platitudes from me or anybody else but, rather, she wants action. I wish to assure her that we have started taking swift actions and I hope Members will work together to take several more swift and decisive actions in the coming days, including: mandatory open disclosure legislation; the establishment of a statutory inquiry; a protocol on information such that any woman who wants a repeat smear test can get one; moving towards HPV testing in October of this year; and ensuring that women are automatically informed of information to do with their own medical records. Ms Phelan stated outside the court and to me that she wished to ensure something good comes from the horrific situation that has been experienced by her, her family and now, sadly, other families. I wish to assure her and all Members that I will work day and night to ensure that happens.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	708	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." Apologies are owed to the staff of the Oireachtas for the lateness of the hour at which this business is being taken. I wish to thank my colleagues in Independents4Change for facilitating me this evening in trying to progress the Bill. It is a Bill about protecting children, in particular from those who, for various reasons, sexually abuse children. Ireland has a horrific past in terms of protecting and guarding children. That is evident from events in the industrial schools, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and some foster homes. However, Ireland has come a long way in terms of ensuring the safety of children and progress is being made in regard to child welfare and protection. We have the Children First Act, child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools, child safeguarding statements, designated liaison officers in schools and Garda vetting of those working with children. Although there are still gaps and room for improvement, imagine what it must be like for children in countries where they have no protection, child welfare or safeguards. The Bill is about trying to protect children who are easy prey for sexual predators in countries where the authorities cannot or will not protect them. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises a child as being a person under the age of 18. Trafficking is the third biggest illegal industry, after arms and drugs, and accounts for billions of dollars annually. The number of trafficked children is conservatively estimated at 4.5 million and statistics indicate that 2 million children are lured or abducted into sexual exploitation, which is modern day slavery. It is incredible that we are discussing child sexual abuse using seemingly contradictory terms such as industry and tourism. However, the consequences for the affected children are horrific. There are physical, mental, emotional and psychological consequences and children may suffer from suicide, depression, addiction and sexually transmitted illnesses, including HIV and AIDS. The abuse occurs in countries such as India and many in South-East Asia, Latin America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa. The common denominator is poverty and a lack of education. Child sexual abuse is about manipulating and exploiting vulnerabilities. There have been many high-profile cases but I will mention only one, that of a seven year old child who was sold to a former American marine. The former marine was eventually extradited from South-East Asia and is serving a very extensive prison sentence in the United States. There are records of the sale of virgin girls and of organised sex rings. A report by Ending Child Prostitution and Trafficking International, ECPAT, states that child sex tourism has drastically increased. One of the main reasons is that the increase in global travel has created more opportunities for abuse. The profile of offenders has also changed. The stereotypical offender was a white, wealthy, western middle-aged man, although some offenders were women. Although some offenders still fit that profile, there are also situational offenders, persons who do not seek to sexually exploit children but will do so if given the opportunity. Such situational offenders may be business travellers or migrant transient workers. The promotion of tourism in these poorer countries for economic growth is bringing more and more westerners to places in which there is little or no regulation or policing but more and more children available for sex. I read of an organisation that offers sex tours with stops at bars and restaurants that are fronts for child prostitution. It described the sex tours as being like going to McDonalds: there is a menu to choose from, it is quick and it is cheap.  I wish to refer to the work of Irish priest, Fr. Shay Cullen, who is directly involved in rescuing children from the sex tourism industry in the Philippines and supporting children affected by it. At a recent press conference, he spoke of what has been happening through the dark web and the rise in child pornography. To join a photo-sharing paedophile club on the dark web, applicants must submit pictures of children being abused. Some clubs insist on the applicant showing himself perpetrating the abuse. To get the images, men travel to countries where there is ample opportunity to photograph and video such abuse. The images then give them a pass to access further unlimited images. This requirement to provide pictures is fuelling travel to poorer countries. Cyber sex is on the increase. Fr. Cullen spoke about five and six year olds being abused over the Internet. The abuse is carried out to order and customers around the world pay per view through money transfer companies. In 2017 it emerged that some 700 to 800 Australian male convicted child sex offenders were travelling annually to countries in South-East Asia such as the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand. Following the revelation, the Australian Government acted by passing the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Act in 2017. It was introduced in the Australian Parliament on 14 June 2017, passed by both Houses on 20 June and received assent on 26 June 2017. The Act allows a competent authority of the Australian Government to request its Minister for Foreign Affairs to refuse to issue, cancel or order the surrender of a person's Australian passport if the person's name is on a child protection offender register. The purpose is to prevent reportable offenders from travelling overseas to sexually exploit or abuse vulnerable children in places where those activities are not monitored. I wish to thank Maeve NÃ­ LiathÃ¡in of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, David Dodd of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and Ciaran O'Brien in my office for their work on the Bill. It is a tricky situation for which to legislate because of the constitutional right to travel and a good example of unintended consequences because, although it is wonderful to have the right to travel, one can be sure that the constitutional amendment is not intended to grant a right to travel in order to abuse children in other countries when one has been convicted of child sexual abuse in one's own country. To state the situation using commercial jargon such as demand, market and supply, we have no ability to target the supply side in other countries.We agree we could do more in terms of demand but what we can do also is protect children by preventing access to the markets by abusers. Child sex tourism is linked with trafficking and organised crime in many countries. It is in countries that carry low detection and low conviction rates, both here and internationally, so these child abusers know they are carrying a low risk when they engage with the child sexual trade abroad. Hence, there is a greater need for the Irish authorities to do more to prevent access to vulnerable children. The purpose of the Bill is to regulate and restrict, where appropriate, sex offenders from travelling abroad in the interests of the common good and to protect persons from serious harm outside the State. It seeks to do that by increasing the powers of judges. It is not an outright ban on travelling. Currently, there are a number of ways convicted sex offenders can be prevented from travelling but an important feature of this Bill is the way in which it redefines protection from serious harm to mean physical or psychological harm caused by the person committing a sexual offence. The current definition of "serious harm" is very restrictive, therefore, this Bill is making it stronger. Regarding the impact on the right to travel, at least at an international law level, restrictions to human rights are permitted as long as they adhere to the standards of legality, necessity and proportionality. If the Bill is passed, the legality element will be fulfilled. The emphasis on judges' discretion will go to the necessity aspect, and proportionality is covered as the restriction will be on a case-by-case basis. If, on the next Stage, certain countries can be highlighted such as those which lack adequate child protection rather than an outright ban on travel, that will also cover proportionality. ECPAT International has done a lot of work on balancing the right to privacy of a convicted child sex offender with the need to protect children. One of the recommendations in a particular report states that every restrictive measure for convicted travelling sex offenders should be adopted on a case-by-case basis with the assessment of a multidisciplinary team - judicial, psychological and the police. That would also be in keeping with the legislation in approximately 40 countries whose citizens can be prosecuted for child sexual abuse committed while those citizens are abroad. The difficulty is that in those countries where the child sexual abuse is taking place, it is happening with impunity because the authorities, including the police, are involved. Even though 173 countries signed the optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in May 2016, there is continued widespread child sex tourism, with well-known child sex tourism destinations. At this point, convicted offenders can travel from Europe to those countries to abuse children. There is a need to put child protection at the core of tourism strategies. Work and training is going on, including in Ireland, for those working in hotels on what to recognise in regard to child sexual abuse and how to identify potential sex tourists. The organisation doing that in Ireland is Mercy Efforts for Child Protection Against Trafficking in the Hospitality Sector, MECPATHS. Some organisations are working on a corporate policy for employers to state they will not knowingly engage in the sexual exploitation of a child. There are varying theories on working with paedophiles and child sex offenders but I want to mention the programmes in Ireland for child sex offenders. I spoke to somebody who works in those programmes. He spoke of that moment of insight into the behaviour and an awareness of what they were doing in terms of the damage and then the genuine motivation to seek amends and work on the behaviour. That is very valuable work. In the same way that somebody who is in recovery from alcoholism would be advised not to go near a bar or a pub and somebody recovering from a gambling addiction will be advised not to go near a bookies or somewhere they can bet, equally, for a child sex offender, it would be very helpful for their recovery that they are restricted in being able to travel to countries where children are readily available for sexual abuse. I want to mention women who are trafficked into this country for the purpose of prostitution. A common denominator among them is that the prostitution began when they were children. They owe their lives to organisations like Ruhama. I read the Minister's amendment and I will address that when I am concluding the debate, but this Bill is about vulnerable children and giving them the opportunities to develop their potential and not have it cut short by men, many from our country and from other countries in Europe.

I commend Deputy OâSullivan and her staff, as well as the Oireachtas staff, on the work they have done on this Bill and on highlighting the issue and the need for such a Bill. The Bill before us today would amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to give the Judiciary the power to restrict the travel of convicted sex offenders to countries where there may be much lower child protection standards. Sections 16, 27 and 30 of the 2001 Act would therefore be amended. Section 2 of the Bill outlines the amendment to section 16 of the 2001 Act whereby subsection (5) provides for the person committing offences outside of the State, which would constitute a sexual offence under Irish law. Section 5 amends section 30 of the 2001 Act and inserts a new section 30B providing for the offender to make an application if they want to leave the State or that a probation and welfare officer may make an application. This wording gives the power to the judge and the court to use their discretion in granting or refusing the application. This Bill is the result of work Deputy Maureen OâSullivan has done with Fr. Shay Cullen, the very worrying growth of sex tourism markets in developing countries and the urgent need to protect children and vulnerable people in the countries where there is a prevalence of sex tourism. Fr. Cullen founded the Peopleâs Recovery, Empowerment and Development Assistance Foundation, PREDA, in the Philippines and has been working with trafficked women and children since 1969. He has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for that outstanding work on four occasions. If this Bill passes and is enacted, we would be the first European country to restrict the travel of convicted sex offenders and we would be following Australiaâs lead internationally. Fr. Cullen, who has worked tirelessly in the Philippines for 50 years, has said that children in the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia in particular need to be protected from predatory paedophiles. There may be issues, to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred, around the constitutional right to travel and how some of the countries I mentioned would be identified. We have the example of Australia, and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan can address all these issues in her concluding remarks. They can also be discussed on Committee Stage following passage through Second Stage. It is important that the House takes the step to pass this legislation on Second Stage. Fr. Cullen has told us that globally, approximately 4.5 million children are trafficked every year and that the horrendous trafficking business is worth at least $32 billion. It is mainly women being trafficked and it is estimated that more than one third are children. UNICEF estimates that in the Philippines alone, approximately 60,000 children are abused every year. Fr. Cullen has warned us that an increasing number of Irish bars are opening in the Philippines, that the sex tourism trade from here is growing and that there are already reported increases of people travelling from the European Union, America and Australia to these areas to exploit children and vulnerable people. As I mentioned, Australia has already passed legislation, the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Act 2017, which restricts the travel of sex offenders with reporting obligations. Not only does the Australian law restrict their travel but it makes it an offence, with a maximum penalty of five years, to travel or to try to travel without authorisation. If offenders have a legitimate reason to travel they may apply and once their reporting obligations have finished, they will then be able to apply for a passport. The importance of the Australian Act of 2017 was confirmed when it took effect immediately, in December last year, by stopping a convicted paedophile from travelling. There are approximately 20,000 registered child sex offenders with reporting obligations in Australia, and the south-east Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are easily accessible to Australians. The Australian justice Minister, Michael Keenan, said that during 2016 approximately 800 registered child sex offenders travelled overseas and that over one third of them did so without permission. Reports last year found that there were almost 200 sex offenders living around Ireland and being monitored by An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na. According to the Irish Prison Serviceâs statistics, at the end of November there were 377 prisoners in custody for sex offences - 376 male prisoners and one female. Deputy Maureen OâSullivan has drafted this Bill to allow for the judges' discretion in taking into account the offenders engagement in the rehabilitative process. We must acknowledge the work being done by mental health services, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, other organisations and volunteers in our communities who are working with sex offenders during their sentences, probation and release to support them in not reoffending and thereby making communities safer.This Bill is not about restricting a constitutional right to travel but about protecting children and vulnerable women in countries where protection laws and their implementation are not sufficiently robust. The Sex Offenders Act 2001 addresses the monitoring of sex offenders from other jurisdictions who may move to Ireland. Information is shared with Interpol to ensure that sex offenders from other jurisdictions who are subject to reporting requirements must inform An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and continue with their reporting obligations here. Fr. Shay Cullen from Glenageary has highlighted cases in the Philippines of missionaries and activists being arrested and threatened with deportation for being engaged in "political activities". Such activities include advocating for peopleâs basic human rights. Fr. Cullen has previously expressed concern as to why certain businesses are allowed to continue to operate and has made allegations about bribery. The PREDA foundation rescues girls from brothels and boys, 15 years old and younger, from detention cells. It houses around 35 boys and 40 girls in separate homes and helps them to overcome the traumas they have endured. Children receive education and counselling, have emotional release therapy and are encouraged and supported to file legal complaints if they so wish. The PREDA foundation also has a fair trade project, working with local farmers and indigenous communities to sell and market their mango products. Fr. Shay Cullen and his team are doing amazing work. It is heartbreaking to think that his organisation has been in demand for so long and that the demand is not waning. This Bill will help Fr. Cullen and others who work to protect vulnerable women and children in many countries in south Asia and elsewhere. We owe it to them to take all measures necessary to stop sex tourism. I commend Deputy OâSullivan and her staff on bringing this Bill forward and I am delighted to support it.

I very much appreciate the Deputy's intentions in bringing forward these proposals and I share her concern that a sex offender convicted in this country be prevented from causing further harm, not just here but also abroad. I know that in making these proposals the Deputy is most concerned with countries where child protection would not be at the same level as here in Ireland. The prevention of further harm by a convicted sex offender after release from prison is what underpins the current system of notification and monitoring under the Sex Offenders Act 2001. That Act provides for the monitoring of convicted sex offenders after they have been released from prison. Such individuals are required by law to provide to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na details such as their address. Failure to comply with these requirements is an offence. As part of the notification requirements, sex offenders must also notify An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na if they intend to travel outside of this jurisdiction for seven days or more. The intention behind this is for the relevant authorities in their destination to be notified of the presence of a convicted sex offender in that jurisdiction. I recognise that the current provisions, while effective in many respects, are not the same as what Deputy O'Sullivan has proposed here. The current system works particularly well in circumstances where there is good co-operation already, like that between An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the PSNI in Northern Ireland and where there are very high standards of child protection, including across the EU. I am acutely conscious, however, that this may not be as effective in countries where there are inadequate protections for vulnerable people, including children, who may be exploited in an abhorrent and totally unacceptable way by relatively wealthy foreigners. In particular, child abuse is an utterly depraved crime. I share Deputy OâSullivanâs commitment to seek to prevent such abuse from taking place and commend the Deputy on her commitment to this issue which she has discussed with me in the past. I also acknowledge the work of Fr. Shay Cullen and his team in Asia and in the Philippines in particular and thank him for what he is doing on the international stage to further the protection of children. He is a great ambassador for Ireland who has been in this House on a number of occasions in the company of Deputy O'Sullivan. On behalf of the Government, I am anxious to ensure that we explore this legislation further in an effort to advance the proposals contained therein. The Bill proposes to give the court the power to impose restrictions on the travel abroad of a convicted sex offender who is subject to the requirements of the 2001 Act. The Bill would give a judge the power to restrict foreign travel entirely or to require an application to be made to the court for permission to travel. This would go significantly further than existing restrictions and I am advised that there are legal and practical implications that must be considered. In the first instance it is the duty of the Oireachtas to ensure that any legislation is compatible with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. We must also take account of the current policies and procedures of stakeholders, in this case An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the probation and welfare aervice, although the Legislature is vested with the power to legislate and I fully respect that mandate. Deputy OâSullivan and I have engaged on this issue before and I fully recognise that the Bill as drafted seeks to address some of the constitutional concerns previously raised. However, I am advised that there are problems remaining from a legal perspective as well as some practical issues and accordingly, I believe that a pre-legislative scrutiny exercise by the relevant Oireachtas committee would allow these issues to be worked through while retaining the principle at the heart of the Bill which is to prevent harm and protect the vulnerable, particularly children. The Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality may wish to bring in experts to inform its deliberations, which would be most valuable. I would ask the Deputies opposite to engage with me in that process. The committee might also consider the potential legal implications under the Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of balancing the rights of a convicted offender, post-release, with the need to protect people from harm. I would also request the committee to look closely at examples from other jurisdictions where such measures are in place to determine how they are enforced and whether they have faced any legal challenge. In that context, I was interested to hear what Deputies O'Sullivan and Broughan said about the current situation in Australia. Deputy O'Sullivan indicated that similar legislation was enacted pretty speedily in Australia. We can look at that process and I would be happy to give the matter further consideration. Engagement such as I am proposing at the Oireachtas committee might put us in a position to advance this Bill in a speedier manner than might be suggested by my amendment. I would also hope that the committee would have regard to how such a system can be implemented practically and how it can avoid inadvertent consequences. It is important that convicted sex offenders who are making genuine efforts to be rehabilitated are not subject to restrictions which could impede this, for example, where an offender has served a sentence and is living on one side of the Border on this island but working on the other, or where such restrictions would interfere with the right to family life, albeit of a cross-jurisdictional nature.In my view, pre-legislative scrutiny presents an important opportunity to answer these questions after in-depth consideration. The outcome of that process should then inform a Second Stage discussion of the proposals in this Bill. It is important to note that the Government has been examining closely the current provisions under the 2001 Act. I intend to bring a draft general scheme of a sex offenders (amendment) Bill before the Government shortly. The aim of this legislation will be to amend the 2001 Act on foot of a review of the management of sex offenders under that Act. It will include a number of amendments to the notification requirements under the 2001 Act, including stricter notification requirements such as requiring offenders to notify the Garda of a change of address within three days as opposed to the existing seven days. The Bill will provide for the enhanced supervision of high-risk offenders, including through electronic monitoring in limited circumstances. The Bill will permit the necessary disclosure of information relating to an offender where there is a genuine risk to the public. In bringing my proposals to the Government, I recognise that there are improvements to be made to the current system. It is in the spirit of making improvements, exploring every opportunity to make sure we have a robust body of law that protects children and ensuring this country can play its part on the international stage, as is the intention of the Bill that has been proposed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, that I am proposing the amendment I have set out this evening. I acknowledge the role that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has played in this process and the important contribution her Bill is making to the protection of children on the international stage. I hope we will have an opportunity in the coming months to engage further on this legislation with the aim of making appropriate improvements to ensure we end up with a constitutionally sound and legally robust Act. I trust this House will have an opportunity to discuss this further at the earliest opportunity.

It is undoubtedly true that people who have been convicted of sex abuse in this State are travelling to other countries to abuse children. We have an obligation to protect such children. The work of the PREDA Foundation in this area has to be commended. Fianna FÃ¡il supports this Bill in principle. I acknowledge that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has addressed some constitutional issues that may exist. Fianna FÃ¡il shares her concerns while believing they can be ironed out. In particular, consideration will have to be given to whether the provisions of this Bill amount to a breach of the constitutional right to travel. We will submit amendments on Committee Stage to help to improve and strengthen the Bill in this respect. Sex offenders travel to certain countries because they know they can engage in the sexual exploitation of children with relative impunity in those jurisdictions. According to ECPAT International, which is a non-governmental organisation that campaigns against child sex tourism, child sex tourism is prevalent in more than 24 countries, with the worst affected locations being in South America and south-east Asia. UNICEF estimates that 2 million children throughout the world are exploited sexually every year, which is just horrific. As we know, Australia has become one of the first countries to place restrictions on convicted paedophiles who seek to leave the country. It has done this with a view to protecting children in other countries. If child sex tourism is to be tackled, there needs to be a co-operative global effort. Through this Bill, Ireland certainly has the capacity to be at the forefront of this effort. According to a global study on the sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism, or SECTT, which was carried out in the Netherlands:Europe remains the number one tourist destination, welcoming more than half of the world's tourists in 2013, and there are suggestions that children's vulnerability to SECTT is on the rise. Western European countries have long been sources of travelling child sex offenders... but some are now destinations. Countries in Central and Eastern Europe are emerging as source and destination countries - often lacking the laws to protect children that exist elsewhere in the region.The report continues:Twenty years ago, it might have been possible to sketch a rough global map showing where international travelling sex offenders were from, and where they were going. Today, the distinctions between countries of origin and countries of destination are blurring. Terms such as country of 'origin', 'destination' or 'transit' are rapidly becoming outdated - countries can be any of these, or even all three, at different times. SECTT is now mainly a domestic and intra-regional crime, and can be found in both the world's most developed and least developed countries. What matters is where children are victimised everywhere. Given that two decades of efforts have failed to put a dent in SECTT, that more children than ever before are being affected and that no country is immune, the Global Study highlights the need to re-frame this issue - looking beyond what was once referred to as 'child sex tourism'. This means broadening the scope of policies, programmes and research to include tourism and travel (whether international or domestic), and identifying and addressing what it is, exactly, about travel and tourism, that leaves children so vulnerable to exploitation. In 2016, the Government gave a commitment to introduce "stronger sanctions aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation, child abuse material and online grooming" and to "enhance the arrangements... for post-release supervisions". The Fine Gael-led Government has failed to honour these commitments. As we have seen in the first four months of 2018, it is continuing to fail to protect children from the most abhorrent crimes. In January, we learned that a 26 year old, Matthew Horan, had used numerous social media sites to gather thousands of images of children as young as nine. In February, the Garda Inspectorate published a report which found that too few gardaÃ­ are deployed to try to catch sexual abusers of children and online groomers and that the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na has been slow to make the necessary changes in its approach to child abuse crimes. In March, we heard the shocking news that 11 people had been arrested in Limerick as part of an investigation into a child sex ring. In April, there was a public outcry when a former civil servant who had been caught in possession of almost 60,000 child pornography images and videos escaped a jail sentence. Although Fianna FÃ¡il welcomed the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, we do not believe the Act goes far enough. Part 2 of that Act introduced new offences relating to the sexual exploitation of children, including online grooming. If the gardaÃ­ are not resourced to police the Internet, these criminals will continue to go undetected. Part 3 of the 2017 Act introduced increased maximum sanctions for those convicted of sexual offences against children. While increased maximum sentences for these awful crimes are welcome, the Government's failure to establish a sentencing commission means there continues to be huge inconsistency in the sentences handed down in cases of this nature. Indeed, on 27 April 2018, Ms Justice Ãna NÃ­ Raifeartaigh, while sentencing a man convicted of the repeated rape of his granddaughter, described the lack of sentencing guidelines as "bizarre". The Government must face up to the fact that it is continuing to fail our children. If Fianna FÃ¡il were in government, it would help to address this situation by establishing a judicial sentencing commission to issue sentencing guidelines, promote clarity and consistency in sentencing and improve public confidence in the system. We would look for more vigorous post-release supervision of convicted sex abusers. We would resource the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na properly to enable it to target child sex abusers effectively, particularly online. We would resource the Internet safety office within the Department of Justice and Equality properly too. We would also establish a digital safety commissioner. Having said that, we commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and we support this Bill.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	714	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for introducing it.As my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin, has said, Fianna FÃ¡il will support this Bill in principle but will submit amendments on Committee Stage to improve and strengthen it. I welcome the suggestions and amendments proposed by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan. I came to this House in the hope that new politics could work and I am quite sure that with an important matter like this, all heads, whether Independents or in all parties or none, can find a solution to an increasing problem that must be tackled as soon as possible. We all know there needs to be a concerted effort not just by politics in this House, but globally, to bring a halt to child sex tourism. This Bill will allow Ireland to come to the fore in this effort. Deputy O'Loughlin referred to instances relevant to Ireland and only this weekend in my own constituency there were two violent sex offenders, with one being a child rapist. They were both apprehended in the North of Ireland after travelling there from the South. They had been sighted in various locations over the previous days, including Limerick, Cork and several places in County Louth. Their successful arrest arose from a concerted effort by the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, coupled with the concerns in communities that knew of their existence and the positive aspects of social media. Despite the way in which they were detained in advance of the PSNI arresting them being unacceptable in that they were "tarred and feathered" and left tied to a bench, we must be pleased there was a successful outcome in this instance. Many sex offenders manage to escape our jurisdiction and they are then free to commit crimes elsewhere. It is alleged the person at the centre of the Garda Tony Golden slaying was able to move freely from the North to the South despite his terrible depravity and issues arising from his conduct as a sex offender. He was able to move in and out of the jurisdiction unhindered. We all know there are more than 24 countries where child sex tourism is prevalent. As others have said, the worst affected locations include South America and south-east Asia. My colleague commented on UNICEF's figure of 2 million children being exploited globally each year. Coupled with Deputy Broughan's figures for the people in jail in this country, as well as sex offenders not in jail, it seems we must be at the fore in preventing an escalation in rates of a heinous crime against young children. I appreciate that we cannot legislate for all those travelling, and particularly those with no convictions, but we should certainly aim to stop registered sex offenders from travelling abroad to carry out offences. There are currently a number of ways in which convicted sex offenders can be prevented from travelling overseas following release from prison, including the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. It is possible to impose an order on a convicted sex offender that would prohibit the person from doing one or more things as specified in the order, including travelling outside Ireland or to a specific country. I refer specifically to the Bill and welcome the changes proposed in sections 2 to 5 that deal with court orders against sex offenders, including post-release supervision orders and protecting persons outside the State from sex offenders travelling to commit crimes. I also welcome in particular the imposition of a condition so that a sex offender may be prohibited or restricted from leaving the State. Some may say this amounts to a breach in the constitutional right to travel but anybody convicted of a sexual offence against either a child or adult should be stripped of that constitutional right. If this was known in advance, perhaps some people would think twice about their deviance. There is the matter of illegal online activities and child pornography being connected with people convicted of sexual assault. These people should also know there could be severe consequences for these vile sexual assaults and such online activities. There is no question that we need stronger deterrence than just a couple of years in prison before the slate is wiped clean. Many people know that if they wish to travel to America and other places, they need a clean slate. I know people who committed minor offences in their youth, who should not be barred from travelling, but in the case of sexual violence against either a child or adult, people should suffer the consequences. The Bill could also impose a condition that a sex offender should make an application to the court under a proposed section 30B if he or she intends to leave the State. This would empower judges to restrict, where appropriate, the travel of those convicted of such child sexual offences. This would be where it is deemed that travel could pose a risk to vulnerable persons in jurisdictions outside the State that do not have adequate child protection and welfare legislation. I would amend the 2001 Act in a technical way to make specific changes on a case-by-case basis, allowing judges to make travel restrictions or not, depending on the circumstances of individual cases. This country has a dark history with regard to child protection. There are numerous cases where there was no supervision by the State and there was the appalling issue of clerical child abuse and institutional abuse. I am glad to say we have strengthened our protection of children in Ireland as a result of those past failings but we will never be finished and we must do more. Most important, we must protect children in jurisdictions outside Ireland where little or no child protection laws exist and halt the flow of sex offenders travelling to such destinations to commit sexual offences. As I said at the outset, there must be an agreed and common approach from this House to ensure that even post-Brexit, greater co-operation can exist between North and South, as well as with Europe and beyond. Punishment for child sexual abuse in particular must match the crime. If this means there should be imposition of travel restrictions, so be it. We must send a clear message to those involved with such criminality that they will pay for their crime.

A number of years ago, we passed a constitutional amendment in the State which at its heart had the commitment that the interests and welfare of the child would be a paramount concern. It was a significant statement and it is consistent with the intent in this Bill. Our Constitution protects our own citizens but the intent should be to protect children at risk, no matter where they are in the world. I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the Bill, which we will support. I will be guided by her approach to the Government amendment but it is legislation that is of value. It is motivated by what is often called sex tourism, although it is not a phrase of which I particularly approve. It describes the travelling of people from wealthy western countries to developing countries with a view to exploiting more vulnerable people, particularly children.The motivation is to deal with and restrict the ability of sexual offenders to travel to such countries. I refer particularly to where there is inadequate child protection and child welfare legislation. Deputy O'Sullivan has worked closely with the People's Recovery, Empowerment and Development Assistance, PREDA, foundation and Fr. Shay Cullen. He has been campaigning on the issue of children's rights, particularly in south-east Asia. There is a significant problem there with people travelling to exploit people sexually.  The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, says that 60,000 young children are abused in the Philippines annually. PREDA has helped hundreds of children, some as young as seven or eight years old. It is extraordinary work and it is right and proper that whatever legislative support can be given is given. It is primarily a matter to be dealt with by those governments. They are responsible for the extremely poor standards and for failing their own citizens. There is a contribution this State can make. Obviously Ireland, no more than anywhere else, is not immune from this and doubtless there are Irish people who would consider travelling and exploiting in this way.  The legislation seeks to amend the Sexual Offences Act 2001. I acknowledge the Minister has announced he intends to review this legislation and bring forward heads of a Bill to amend the Act shortly. I look forward to engaging with him on that. It does so in a proportionate way. The Minister has stated that he has some views on the constitutionality etc. Most constitutional rights are not absolute. Proportionate interferences with constitutional rights are permitted. That is an established part of constitutional jurisprudence. When somebody is a risk where they are travelling, that would be a perfectly proportionate interference with constitutional rights. There is a balancing of rights. If somebody is a risk then his or her ability to travel should be restricted, in certain circumstances and subject to judicial discretion. That is also at the heart of this legislation.  This is envisioned as a condition that could be placed upon somebody who is convicted. It allows for judicial discretion and flexibility. That is vitally important. It goes about it in the right way. I hope the Government will genuinely work with the proposer of the Bill, Deputy O'Sullivan and that is not going to be another piece of legislation that is stalled. I hope there will be a genuine desire to engage and work through this Bill. I wish to acknowledge a point raised by Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin. I refer to the sentencing of sexual offenders in this country. I have raised this point on a number of occasions. Ms Justice Ãna NÃ­ Raifeartaigh raised the point recently that there are no sentencing guidelines available to judges and that there is inadequate structure or guidance for legal representatives as well. It was described as quite bizarre. I think that was the phrase. I have met the Minister and officials and have tried to be constructive. We have amendments down to the Judicial Council Bill. I recognise the Minister is not here at the minute but we have had a good engagement. I hope he will be able to progress this, that we can work progressively on this and it is something that can be delivered. I refer to delivering sentencing guidelines in the Judicial Council Bill. I hope the Chief Whip will convey that to the Minister.

As Deputy Ã Laoghaire has stated, we will be supporting this Bill. It is a welcome step to protect children in extremely vulnerable positions. This Bill will allow judges to make a decision on a convicted sex offender's ability to travel outside the State based on the case, the offender and the conviction. It is incredibly easy for people convicted of sex offences to travel to states such as the Philippines, Thailand and south-east Asia where there is not robust legislation around child protection and child welfare. This poses a huge risk to children and vulnerable people in these countries. It is about time we implemented legislation that will better protect those children in vulnerable positions outside of the State from Irish predators. The Rape Crisis Network Ireland has shocking statistics in regard to child sex abuse. It is a situation which can only be worse in other countries where law enforcement is not as tight and corruption within police forces and judicial systems is rampant. Ireland has a responsibility to protect others from citizens who have been convicted of such crimes. This will stop convicted paedophiles from Ireland from travelling to other countries to partake in the sex trade there. It should not be easy for people who have been convicted of a sexual offence in this country to travel to countries where it is even easier for them to commit such acts. While I have the opportunity on this topic, we need to do far more in our own country to protect children. I refer in particular to children who are vulnerable and at risk and who may be in care. We have seen so many tragic stories and situations in the not too distant past. I refer to children in a vulnerable position being exploited and taken advantage of. It always really angers me, as I am sure it does other people, but particularly as a mother. One thinks that one would do whatever one can to protect one's children. We need to be far better in this country in respect of legislation to protect those children in the first instance. As my colleague has said, when people are convicted there needs to be much stronger and more robust sentencing. We will be supporting this Bill and commend Deputy O'Sullivan and her colleagues on bringing it forward.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	718	I commend Deputy O'Sullivan on this child protection legislation, the aim of which is to protect children and vulnerable adults from sexual predators. This is a vast industry said to be a $32 billion one, only behind the arms race. Approximately 4.5 million young people and vulnerable adults are trapped in this sex tourism industry on an ongoing basis. The common denominator in this area is the question of poverty and the lack of education. It is an important piece of legislation. It is also a measured piece of legislation. It respects the constitutional right to travel. This type of legislation is not new. It has already been introduced in Australia in 2017. We should follow suit. In 2017, the Australian Government became the first to pass legislation to restrict travel and cancel the passports of convicted paedophiles on the national child sex offenders register. There were 20,000 people on that register in 2017. Another 2,500 offenders were added the following year. These were offenders who served a sentence but were not allowed to travel abroad. One report stated that in 2017, before this legislation came into being, approximately 800 convicted sex offenders travelled annually to south east Asia to countries like the Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand. When we hear this we feel outraged and helpless. However, those of us in the House tonight can do something positive in this regard by supporting Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill and move it to the next Stage. The Bill aims to empower judges to restrict, where appropriate, the travel of persons convicted of a sexual offence where it is deemed that travel could pose a risk to vulnerable persons in jurisdictions outside the State that do not have adequate child protection and child welfare legislation. The aim of the Bill is to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 in a technical way and make specific changes on a case-by-case basis that would allow judges to make travel restrictions, as I have already said. I believe this legislation is measured. It allows judges to make restrictions on a case-by-case basis. Judges can also consider whether the convicted offender has engaged in any significant rehabilitative process. The most important part of the Bill or the most important change that the Bill is putting forward is a change in the definition of "serious harm" in the current law. In the current law, serious harm is defined as "death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological, which would be occasioned if the offender were to commit a sexual offence after he or she has been released into the community". The legislation would change the interpretation of physical or psychological harm caused by the person. This change would make it far easier to stop a registered sex offender from travelling abroad. Of course, the distinction is that all sexual harm to children is serious harm. Irish legislation should reflect that. The legislation is also supported by Fr. Shay Cullen who has worked in this area in the Philippines for many years, having set up an organisation called the PREDA Foundation in 1974. The organisation rescues sexually-abused children. Social workers and therapists take care of them and help them to heal and overcome the trauma of rape and sexual assault perpetrated by foreign child sex offenders. Some of them are likely to travel to developing countries from Ireland. We know that prevention is better than cure. I believe that we have the power, influence and responsibility in the House tonight to prevent Irish paedophiles from travelling to foreign countries where the rule of law is weak and children are vulnerable. The case made by Fr. Cullen and others has been made clearly and plainly. Young people have been sexually abused by these tourists in countries where the law is simply not strong enough to deter commission of these offences. There is clear evidence that in Ireland, as recently as February of this year, the question of pornography and paedophilia on the Internet has been exposed. Homes were raided here in February of this year of paedophile suspects based on information received from the authorities in the USA, Canada and other law enforcement agencies. It is reported that as many as 150,000 images of children being sexually abused were found. Certainly, we do not want these paedophiles to be allowed to travel from Ireland to take advantage of poor and uneducated children in other parts of the world. I am disappointed that the Minister of State and the Government are not supporting this legislation. I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw his opposition and support this legislation. Any changes or discussions that are needed and any checking of this legislation that is required can be done on Committee Stage.

I apologise for missing the slot. I was watching for other speakers who were before me. I am happy to speak on the Bill tonight. All of us in the House know that Deputy O'Sullivan is a person of integrity and her commitment to issues of social justice here and abroad is well-recognised. I have every confidence that the Bill Deputy O'Sullivan has placed before the House is measured and reasonable legislation that seeks to adopt sane and logical restrictions on the free movement of those convicted of certain classes of offences. It is necessary and timely to have a debate around this area. It appals everyone that people commit or perpetrate such crimes. Those of us who have studied the matter to any depth know that these are devious people who seek to confuse, mislead and cover their tracks. They go to all rounds to commit their heinous crimes. It is absolutely staggering to read the statistics relating to international child sexual abuse. Indeed, the more one reads the numbers involved, the more we see what a nightmare it truly is for so many children and young people. According to the research conducted by UNICEF in 38 low and middle-income countries, close to 17 million adult women report having experienced forced sex as children. The volume, sheer numbers, pain and anguish behind the figure beggars belief. I compliment UNICEF and other non-governmental organisations and agencies that do so much work in this field to attempt to get some rein on the scope of the crimes. In 28 countries in Europe, approximately 2.5 million young women report experiences of contact and non-contact forms of sexual violence before the age of 15. It is truly horrendous. Children should enjoy being children and have childhood experiences in life. Many of those affected are from traumatised countries where there is war, famine and God knows what else. Then they have these vile acts perpetrated on them. Recently, I spoke on a Bill relating to the United Nations. Thankfully, our people were exonerated in inquiries. However, some people have gone into some areas to save people, keep the peace and give hope and solace to people in war-torn areas. Some of these people have violated and broken the very trust placed in them because of the uniform and because they represented the United Nations. They were supposed to be there to help out rather than violate people and commit crimes against them. Of course this type of sexual violence is not restricted to victims who are girls or young women. In one year alone, the World Health Organization estimated that 73 million boys under 18 years of age experienced forced sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual violence. If the Bill can in any way help to combat or reduce these horrific statistics then we must all support it. As I said, Deputy O'Sullivan has a track record in this area. She has travelled to many areas as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and is passionate about what she does. There will be concerns about the appropriate balancing of rights and restrictions. However, I believe that in such serious, intolerable, vile and nasty crimes we should forget the balance sometimes. I do not mean that literally but we must tilt the balance in favour of the victims. Too often, we fail to do that. I believe that given the vast scale of the problem and the fact that the Bill provides for judicial oversight, the right balance has been struck. I realise the courts system is clogged up.We as legislators need to give some solace in respect of ensuring people will not travel from this country with no other intent but to commit heinous and desperate crimes. We must have restrictions.  I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and her staff on the excellent work they have put into this Bill and other legislation. I look forward to supporting it here and on different Stages of the legislative process. It is a pity the Government has seen fit to put down amendments to it to hold it up. We cannot open up the floodgates and throw away respect for the rule of law. We cannot have that.  I notice lately, and I discussed this with Deputy Clare Daly this evening, that a mob law culture has emerged with respect to people who are convicted for these crimes in this country and who have served their punishment and done their time. I do not like the mob law culture that has developed in some areas whereby these people have arrived in an area or where they have been relocated or housed. Those people have committed the crime, horrible as it is, and served their time. The court system saw fit to punish them and they have served their time. If they had done that, they are now back out as innocent people, provided they are being monitored. I do not like the mob law we see on Facebook and other social media, which is terrorising some of those people, threatening to burn them out and with all kinds of behaviour. Two wrongs do not make a right. It is important we maintain and respect the rule of law. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this Bill.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	722	That is correct. We need to see Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's Bill in the wider context of inequality on a global scale where the poorest countries are at an enormous disadvantage. There is a certain irony in that last week on Private Members' business we were discussing the shortage of nurses here because we do not pay them enough, which has led to us basically hoovering up valuable medical staff from those same developing countries, which they could use at home. We have seen it before with issues such as adoption, where people with money can travel to foreign countries and pay huge sums of money to adopt children, in some instances, in areas where they do not know whether the mother has been forced into a pregnancy in order to deliver, in essence, a baby for sale, or where they do not know what the circumstances are, whether poverty, in and of itself, has forced that person to give up her child. This issue is similar. It is the poverty in these countries and the lack of regulation that exposes people of all ages to engage in sex work, sometimes to combat poverty, but it also is that system that exposes them to gross exploitation and danger. While I note the points made by Deputy O'Loughlin about the Netherlands study, how sex tourism is possibly shifting a bit and that we cannot use terms such as that as they are becoming outdated, we all know there are certain countries where this activity is not governed appropriately and where it is much more prevalent. People deliberately and purposely go to those countries to engage in underage sex, which they would not get away in other jurisdictions. The idea that that could ever be voluntary in the case of the child is utter nonsense. If we want to protect children at home, we have a global responsibility to protect them abroad as well.  I am very glad that people have drawn on the excellent work done by Fr. Shay Cullen and the People's Recovery Empowerment Development Assistance Foundation, PREDA. The stories that come from them about lives destroyed are utterly heartbreaking. I will not repeat the points that have been made. It is the case because people think they can get away with it off the grid. One of the pieces written by Fr. Cullen was quite illustrative in terms of looking at the bounce-back and how it can come home to us.  Deputy Healy referred to 150,000 child images being found in Ireland in February as a result of raids on people's based on information from abroad. He made the point correctly that to join a photo-sharing paedophile club on the dark web, one has to prove one's credentials. One has to show pictures of abuse and often one has to show oneself taking part in that abuse in order to prove one's bona fides. In many instances, people do that by travelling abroad to abuse children. Following that, as we know, many of them are not put on trial and bribe their way out of it. This Bill is important. It is not a panacea but it examines an aspect of the problem. It is a child protection measure. It is not about retribution with respect to people who had committed a crime in the past and who were rehabilitated or were striving to deal with their criminal behaviour. That is important because it is not a blanket ban naming countries and it is not a blanket ban excluding sex offenders. It gives discretion to the Judiciary to weigh up the progress of somebody who was on the sex offenders register to see if he or she is a person who should be restricted because there is a fear that the person's offending behaviour will recur in another jurisdiction. That is proportionate. I do not agree with the comments about rights. We need to balance rights, and I am not in favour of tipping rights on either side. A society has to be able to respect all rights and not ignore them. I echo the points made by Deputy Mattie McGrath. There is an appalling development in vigilante behaviour with respect to this area of crime. There are terrible cases of entrapment using social media and so on, which I do not find acceptable. What this Bill is trying to do is much more proportionate. It does not propose a travel ban or blacklisting countries. It is very much proportionate to protecting children in other jurisdictions.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	723	I wish to commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, her team, Fr. Cullen and PREDA on putting together this Bill. The Bill seeks to regulate and restrict, where appropriate, sex offenders from travelling abroad in the interests of the common good and to protect vulnerable persons from serious harm outside Ireland where sex trafficking and child prostitution may be prevalent. The Act seeks to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to empower judges with the option to impose a travel restriction on a case-by-case basis where the deciding judge believes the restriction is warranted. That is important because it is not proposing a blanket ban. I am aware that in other countries, restrictions of this nature can be used for soccer supporters or other supporters who have known records in terms of actions abroad. As far as I am aware, it has also been used in some cases where ISIS or other such groups are moving throughout Europe. They can be looked at as an example of how this can be enacted. To deal with the Bill section by section, the first section deals with protecting vulnerable children in jurisdictions that, unfortunately, do not have the same protections for children as there are in this State. That is not to say we do not have much to do. We still have a lot to do. I refer in particular to those jurisdictions where there is criminality, the judicial system is corrupted and families are vulnerable in that people with money can literally buy off their children. It maintains the constitutional rights of a person convicted of a crime and it empowers judges to impose travel limitations, not prohibition, on a case-by-case basis. All the points have been made by earlier speakers about the way this type of exploitation by paedophiles who have been convicted of serious crimes are able to access countries that have low restrictions and low levels of border protection. It is very important that as a nation and as a legislative body, we should be able to examine this Bill and tease out how best to bring in those restrictions. I have a problem with imposing travel bans and so on because I believe we must be very careful in that regard. However, the Bill tries to deal with that. I will be directed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan as to whether she will accept the Government's amendment but if the Government is serious about trying to deal with this issue, and particularly with Australia's record and its response to the number of paedophiles travelling to eastern Asia, I believe it can be done. I would welcome it if the Government was approaching this honestly and eagerly to try to deal with the issue, but if it is only trying to push this issue down the line again. I ask the Government not to do so and to support the Bill. I favour going in the direction of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's Bill.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-01 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	724	I thank all the Deputies for their considered input to tonight's thought-provoking debate on this important subject. As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, outlined, he has given much thought to the key intention of this Bill, which is to prevent harm to the most vulnerable. As a society, we must always be concerned with those who are most in need of protection and it is right that such concern not cease at the limits of our own country. Our values are pursued all over the world through the good work of the Defence Forces, which serve on overseas missions, and through the work of the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the mission network he oversees, particularly in the developing world and through the UN's institutions. As the Minister made clear, however, there are a range of legal and operational issues which must be considered in light of the proposals in this Bill. There is a rigorous system of post-release supervision in place for convicted sex offenders in Ireland. Under the Sex Offenders Act 2001, at the lowest end, a person who has received a suspended or non-custodial sentence for a sexual offence is subject to the provisions of the Act for five years; and this increases to an indefinite period where a sentence of imprisonment for two years or more has been imposed. A sex offender subject to these provisions must notify An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na of his or her place of residence, and the Act allows the court to specify a period of post-release supervision. The 2001 Act also allows for the imposition of a sex offender order, which may prohibit the person from doing certain things in order to protect the public from harm. Importantly, the 2001 Act has regard to the question of a convicted sex offender who wishes to leave the State for a period. The Act provides that such a person must notify An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na of the person's intention to travel outside the State for seven or more days, and provide the address of the place where the person will stay, if known. This Bill proposes to extend the power of the court to prohibit a person from travelling outside the State entirely or to require that the person must apply to the court for leave to travel. As the Minister noted earlier, this represents a very significant expansion of the terms of the 2001 Act and the Minister has identified a number of issues that require further consideration. The Minister's concerns are centred around two factors: the legal implications of such provisions under the Constitution, EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights; and the practical and policy implications of the proposals with regard to the effective supervision of a convicted sex offender. As a means of addressing these concerns effectively, the Minister has moved the amendment to enable the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality to look closely at these proposals and to address directly the concerns he has identified. He has proposed that the Oireachtas committee has regard to whether the proposed Bill gives rise to constitutional difficulties or difficulties under the European Convention on Human Rights or European Union law; and whether the proposals strike a balanced and measured approach in relation to competing rights, in particular, the balance between the rights the person convicted of a sex offence and the need for protection of vulnerable members of society, including those outside Ireland. The Oireachtas committee will also be asked to examine the extent and scope of any restrictions on travel for convicted sex offenders to other states and to identify the means by which a restriction on travel to other states by a convicted sex offender could be administered and supervised. As part of this, the Oireachtas committee can look at the experience of other jurisdictions which have introduced similar legislative provisions. I am aware that Australia has introduced a similar measure but I am not aware of other examples. The Government believes that pre-legislative scrutiny is an important part of the legislative process. It results in better legislation and it gives Oireachtas Members a greater opportunity to shape legislation and interrogate the underlying principles of a Bill. Pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill will result in a better Bill in due course. As the Minister outlined earlier, he is preparing his own amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 that will enhance the supervision of convicted sex offenders, strengthening the notification requirements and, where the risk posed to the public is significant, allowing for the use of electronic monitoring devices. This Government has, in recent years, also brought forward important legislation on sexual offences in the form of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which updated the law on the grooming of children using modern technology and created new offences. A number of other important pieces of legislation will also be brought forward this year, including the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018 which provides for sentencing for repeat sex offenders. While the intention of this Bill is very clear, these are not easy issues to consider as they impinge on constitutional rights. As the Minister noted earlier, the provisions of this Bill may have unintended consequences. The limitations proposed would restrict all travel outside the State, including on the island. It would be extremely difficult to identify in legislation particular countries where these limits should and could apply but the committee may have recourse to expert advice on that issue and that would be very valuable. The experience of Australia will be important, notwithstanding its different constitutional arrangements and, indeed, the relevance of its geographic location in this context. It will be useful to identify the kinds of travel restrictions on convicted sex offenders that Australia has put in place and how effective these measures have been. With these issues in mind, the Minister proposed this amendment to enable a thorough assessment of these provisions and the broader surrounding issues by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality. The outcome of this process will then inform any discussion of this Bill in 12 months' time. The Minister has asked me to pass on his thanks to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for this proposal and I join him in commending the Deputy on her tireless work on behalf of the vulnerable around the world. The Minister looks forward to contributing to the Second Stage debate on this Bill when it returns to the floor of the DÃ¡il following pre-legislative scrutiny. In the interim period, the Minister believes that we will be in a better position to bring forward amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 which capture the complex legal, constitutional and operational elements of this issue.

I understand the lateness of the debate and the continued pushing back of its time made it difficult for some to stay who wanted to speak. I thank them for the calls to my office in support of the Bill, but I offer special thanks to those who persevered to speak and to those who stayed in the Gallery. With this Bill, Ireland would have an opportunity for another first, such as the plastic bag levy and the smoking ban. Let us look at the realities behind this Bill, one of which is the increase in the number of child sex tourism hot spots with easy access to children. There is the reality of impunity for abusers in those countries. There is the reality of the conditions that drive children into the sex industry, some of whom are sold by their families. These conditions include extreme poverty, unemployment, the lack of access to education and conflict situations. There is also the reality of the sexual exploitation of children. It can be invisible and it is certainly mobile. It is global in both the developed and developing world. It is escalating because there is a marked increase in preferences for children. It is also highly profitable and is facilitated also by easier and cheaper access to travel throughout the world. This is an opportunity to set a benchmark to protect children from serious harm. It is about protecting children from a person outside this State doing an act which, if it was committed here, would constitute a sexual offence by one who has been released into the community after committing such an offence here.The abusers are paedophiles, preferential child sex abusers, situational customers, local prostitute users, tourists, travelling businessmen and some women, migrant foreign workers and the military. It is reckoned that the issues in the Philippines began with the presence of the US military way back. It led to an increase in the number of bars and brothels and an increase in prostitution. The Bill is about empowering judges to impose travel limitations at the time of sentencing or not if the judge is satisfied that there is or is not a risk of offending abroad. It is proportionate and it is also conditional. For example, leave can be granted to attend a funeral in the UK for a couple of days but alarm bells would ring if there was a request to go for three weeks to Thailand or the Philippines. I stress the narrow remit of the Bill.  We say the rights of children are a priority for Ireland. It is certainly outlined in our foreign policy. It is also part of the Irish Aid document, One World, One Future. Ireland has provided funding for End Child Prostitution and Trafficking International, ECPAT International. In 2016 we gave it a grant for three years for a project in Thailand combatting child sexual exploitation. This Bill is a chance to go even further and not just give money. It is an opportunity to do something significant and radical and something that will make a difference in children's lives.  When it came to the amendment, I was struck by the Minister of State's optimism that we will be here in 12 months' time so the work will be done within that timeframe. I thought about it and decided to take all the positives from his speech. I decided that accepting the amendment is a better way to progress the Bill. We also have to acknowledge the backlog of work for the justice committee. I will accept the Minister of State's word and I hope we can work on a shorter timeframe or at least a commitment from Fine Gael that if it is back in Government the Bill will not get lost but will be a priority to be progressed. We owe it to those in those countries. The poverty in those countries is related to our developed world, in particular to those countries that carved up south-east Asia, Latin America, South America and Africa for their empires. It is also related to the continued economic, financial and tax policies of the developed world.  I am all for working together. I heard the Minister of State speak about the balancing of rights. As we are debating this here tonight there are children and young people, boys and girls, who are being sexually exploited, sexually abused and raped in poor countries by men and some women from our world. It is time to ensure the rights of children to their childhood. If European countries can prevent football hooligans from travelling to matches, surely we can do more to save children from convicted sex offenders because the lives of children are more important. There is a right to travel but how can we possibly agree with the right to travel to abuse, hurt and sexually exploit children. That is what I have been trying to do in this Bill. I hope we can see progress on it before 12 months or before the DÃ¡il finishes.
