I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the alarming lack of accountability regarding the 30,000 tonnes of hazardous waste which are unaccounted for in this country each year.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss the report of the EU food and veterinary office on Brazilian beef production, which proves that serious irregularities and shortcomings exist, confirms the allegations made by Irish farm groups regarding beef imported from Brazil and the threat it poses to the health of consumers and underlines the difficulties for EU producers to compete with cheap imports.  The report further strengthens the case for an EU-wide ban to be imposed on Brazilian beef imports and the need for the Government to support such a ban in the interest of Irish farmers and consumers.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12755	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the proposal to construct a relief road at Mallow, County Cork and the urgent need to serve notice to land owners within the vicinity of the project before the period expires, beyond which the compulsory purchase order process cannot take place, thus jeopardising the project's future.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 13 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) statements of each other Member called shall not exceed ten minutes; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome the Minister, another royal, taking the Order of Business.  It is the first time I have seen Deputy Dempsey take the Order of Business.  I thought he was going to be unaccompanied but he has a Minister for Education and Science, of more than two years experience, with him, which is welcome.On No. 13, my party is anxious that more time be made available to discuss the Irish language and perhaps another occasion, if not today, could be found when the issue could be debated again.I wish to know if there will be an opportunity today for the Taoiseach to correct the record of yesterday, where he indicated the Minister for Health and Children first knew of the problems in Portlaoise on 29 August 2007.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13, statements on the Government statement on the Irish language and the Coimisiún na Gaeltachta Report 2002, agreed?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I think——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am here long enough to know also that it is perfectly correct for an Opposition party to indicate reluctance to take business until other matters are dealt with.  That has been a long-held tradition and we have seen many occasions on which the House divided on such an issue.  I do not propose to divide the House on this issue but it is correct to draw attention to the fact that the Taoiseach misled the Dáil when he indicated that the Minister for Health and Children only knew of this issue in 2007 when it transpired that she knew of it two years earlier.  The Taoiseach should indicate at some point that he misinformed the House.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	12	On the same issue, I remind the Minister that it was the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who raised this issue with the Taoiseach yesterday.  The Taoiseach is required not only to clarify the matter to the House but also to Deputy Gilmore because it is now acknowledged that the letters referred to by Deputy Gilmore yesterday, setting out the situation and the concerns about Portlaoise, were written and sent to the relevant authorities as early as the middle of 2005.  The chief executive officer of the HSE, Professor Brendan Drumm, confirmed that in detail at a meeting this morning.  Are arrangements being made by the Taoiseach to correct the record of the House?

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13 agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Bruton on the Order of Business.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I wish to ask about legislation in the Minister for Transport's own area.  I have an interesting document here, dated August 2000, in which the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, indicated she would be establishing a Dublin transport authority and introducing competition on the bus services within Dublin.  She helpfully set an indication that this legislation would be completed by late 2002.  Five years later and 250,000 houses have been built, many of them with no public transport service; no additional buses were provided to Dublin bus; 300,000 additional cars were bought in the Dublin area; and our climate change targets have been completely breached.  Much of this goes back to the failure of the Government to do as it said in 2000, namely, to introduce legislation to provide a framework for the proper planning and delivery of public transport in the city.Was this performance on promised legislation one of the benchmarks used to decide that Ministers and senior civil servants in the Department of Transport warranted a massive increase in pay?  Will he bring a Supplementary Estimate before the House to indicate how his Department will fund the extra pay for these public servants?  Will this money be found by making cutbacks elsewhere, as we have seen in other areas where people who are very vulnerable have suffered cutbacks?  What is the Minister's plan on how these two issues will be dealt with?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It is less than honest to say it is on time and on schedule when this Government promised in 2000 that it would be completed in 2002.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The first matter concerns the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  At the meeting earlier facilitated by the Ceann Comhairle, I asked Professor Drumm if he would arrange a meeting under the auspices of the Ceann Comhairle with the women Members of the Dáil and Seanad to deal with the issue of fear which affects so many women in this country who have had a mammography or who have not had one.

When the Ceann Comhairle was present, I felt the quality of, and attention to, replies by HSE senior executives was somewhat sharper than when they met groups of Deputies on their own.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Today is the first anniversary of the Dublin Transport Authority team report.  The Minister for Transport's predecessor promised that the consultation would be completed and he would publish a Bill before Christmas of last year.  This month is also the second anniversary of the publication of Transport 21.  Almost all the major projects in regard to public transport and Transport 21, including the improvements in transport infrastructure, the metros in Dublin and the improvements in rail lines, are significantly behind schedule and the budget demands on them have grown very significantly.What are the Minister's proposals to deal with the promises made by Government on Transport 21 and last year's promised legislation?  We face a wet day in Dublin and while the Minister has a ministerial car, for most other people it means chaos on the trains and buses.  It will be difficult even to get a taxi in Dublin today.

The Deputy is being very selective in regard to Transport 21.  Most of the national roads projects this year under Transport 21 have been completed on, or ahead of, schedule.

The Minister talked about the roads element, which is important, although primarily for private vehicles.  We want to talk about public transport, namely, trains and buses which were promised but which are not there.  It will be hard to get a taxi in Dublin city today.

Does that mean the Government might legislate to prevent rezoning decisions by councillors from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the Minister's partners in Government, which lead to unsustainable development, urban sprawl and bad environmental consequences, for example, rezoning land which is not near good public transport links?

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I will if I can but I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will let me know if I am not.  Professor Drumm told us this morning the Government promised a national rehabilitation centre for Cork in 2001.  That has not happened and he said it was up to Government to make it happen.  What is the situation in regard to that promise?

What penalties are envisaged for tenants who engage in anti-social behaviour but who are not traceable?  Ultimately, the penalties will fall on landlords if there is to be proper monitoring.The Roads Bill is before the House.  There has been an outstanding issue where roads built in the 1980s and early 1990s, which do not comply with environmental noise levels, are being investigated by local authorities.  There does not seem to be a deadline on the legislation on when these noise pollution measures will be imposed on roads.  Responsibility for many roads is moving to the Minister's Department from local authorities.  Will the Minister comment on that?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	59	People need not be concerned about the fact that non-national roads are moving to my Department.  I have plenty of experience in that area and will be well able to handle them.  On the Noise Bill which will strengthen the legislative basis to address local neighbourhood environmental noise issues, the background proposals are being drafted and we expect to publish the Bill some time late in 2008.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	60	We had 15 commitments from the Minister for Education and Science that the Student Support Bill would be published.  Of course, most of these commitments were given before the last election.  Will the Bill be introduced in the House before Christmas given that students will want this new system in place by September of next year?  The last time I asked this question I was informed the Government had agreed the heads of the Bill.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	69	It must have been an impersonator.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	70	——that he was unable to allow a particular question.  I very much appreciate the personal tone of the letter.  However, this related to a question on provisional drivers and their involvement in accidents in recent years.  I was informed by the questions office that a precedent had been set to the effect that such questions were not in order and the Minister was not accountable to the House.  I have set many precedents in this area over the years.  This question has been answered many times and all the relevant information has been provided.  The Minister must have been able to refer to that information when he made his decision on provisional driving licences and again when he swung a handbrake turn and reversed the whole procedure a few days later.  I put it to the Ceann Comhairle that he contact the questions office in his superior mode and perhaps inform the officials there that we intend to pursue this issue on the basis of positive precedent.

The Minister for Finance intends to publish the Estimates at the same time as the Budget Statement.  Opposition Deputies, including finance spokespersons, do not receive a copy of the Budget Statement until the Minister rises to deliver it in the House.  It used to be the case that Estimates were published approximately three weeks before budget day.  Line Ministers used to give press conferences in their Departments explaining the Estimates and outlining their budgetary proposals for the following year.  Will the Minister arrange a detailed briefing for Opposition finance spokespersons in particular, so we can understand how this year's budget will be dealt with?  This item will also be of significance to the media.The Minister for Finance will produce a statement of between 100 and 200 pages, outlining his budget and his Estimates.  Nobody other than the members of the Cabinet will be notified in advance about the contents of the Minister's speech.  It will be extremely difficult for Opposition finance spokespersons and line spokespersons to identify the Minister's intentions, particularly in respect of Estimates provisions.  The outlook that was published recently deals only with existing levels of service.  It is important that the Government co-operates with Opposition finance spokespeople.  Arrangements should be put in place well in advance of budget day so we can ascertain how the budget will be dealt with.

We have no problem with that in principle and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, correctly mentioned that we were in favour of that reform, but the difficulty is that the Estimates will not be announced until they are revealed with the Budget Statement.  We need advance notice of the intentions of the Estimates.

That is all gone this year.  We understand the reform.  We are not as intellectually challenged as the Minister for Transport seems to think we are.  We are seeking arrangements which will facilitate Deputies and the media as we try to develop a comprehensive understanding of what the Minister for Finance is proposing.  We are asking for fairly detailed arrangements to be put in place to allow the Opposition to do its job in the Dáil on budget day.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19961	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The change that is occurring is radical.  When Deputies are given details of the Estimates, the budget and the tax changes at the same time, they will need to know what is being proposed.  Traditionally, the Estimates Volume does not reveal what is being proposed — that is revealed separately in press releases — which makes it very difficult to respond.  We need to have some structure whereby the House can make sense of what is being proposed, have a meaningful debate on the budget and make decisions on funding late into the night of 5 December.  This is not a trivial issue and I hope the Ceann Comhairle will put his mind to it.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to put before the House the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007 for consideration and debate.From the dawn of civilisation, writing has formed a central part of most known human cultures, enriching beyond estimation the lives of countless people over the ages.  In times past, creators were required to rely for a livelihood on patronage, or on short-term payments to cover what in today's parlance we might refer to as the "making available" of their works either through publication or performance.  In this modern age of mass culture and communication, authors cannot be expected to survive on spiritual sustenance alone.Ireland's contribution to the rich heritage of literature is immense, boasting works from outstanding authors such as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats and James Joyce.  Ireland also has one of the oldest vernacular literature and poetry traditions in Europe representing more or less an unbroken cycle from the 6th century to the present day.  I am delighted that this tradition continues and that Irish writers tend to punch above their weight in literary terms as evidenced by the recent bestowal of the Man Booker prize on an Irish author, Anne Enright, for her book, The Gathering.It is important, therefore, that Ireland continues to nurture a positive creative environment in which writers, poets and playwrights are encouraged to produce works of the intellect and that this contribution is reflected also in terms of economic reward for those creators.  This is vital from the cultural as well as the economic viewpoint because, unless creators obtain a fair return for their intellectual investment, the community at large will not continue to enjoy the benefit of their labours.Copyright protection is absolutely central to securing the links in the economic chain between creator and consumer.  Failure to create or use intellectual property means that our future as an economy will become uncertain.  By the same token, if we continue to create intellectual property ahead of our competitors, it will provide the basis for a successful knowledge society.The purpose of the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007 is to regularise the position in Ireland as regards the lending of copyright works through the public library system.  Prior to the development of State-supported public libraries, private libraries had existed in which lending was made against a subscription or membership fee.  Along with the development of the public library system, demand for a public lending right grew among literary authors who believed they were losing income from book sales due to the wide and free availability of their books in public libraries.The Scandinavian countries were first to introduce a public lending right with Denmark being the first country to do so in 1946.  In the UK, the Public Lending Right Act 1979 followed a 30-year campaign by authors to receive payment for the free use of their books in libraries.  An operational lending scheme has been in existence in the UK since 1981.In 1992, the EU adopted a directive on rental and lending rights which, in the context of lending, provided for an exclusive lending right for authors to permit or refuse the lending of their works.  Alternatively, member states could replace the exclusive right with that of a right to remuneration under which authors would receive, in effect, a royalty payment for the use of the works.  The directive also allowed for the exemption of categories of lending institutions from the public lending right.  Ireland transposed the provisions of the EU directive on public lending in the context of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.However, in 2005, the European Commission instigated legal proceedings against Ireland for failure to correctly transpose certain provisions of the EU rental and lending directive, specifically in respect of public lending.  The European Court of Justice found in the Commission's favour in a decision delivered by that court in January of this year.  The court found that Ireland had overly relied on the exemptions provisions in the directive to exempt all public libraries from the obligation to remunerate authors for the lending of their works.  The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to come into full compliance with the court's decision.The Bill proposes a two-pronged approach reflecting the distinct responsibilities of the two Departments with an interest in this issue.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for intellectual property legislation and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for public libraries.The Bill provides that authors will, in the first instance, be granted an exclusive right to permit the public lending of their works.  This exclusive right will, in the case of books, be replaced by a system of remuneration of authors which will apply to book lendings from the public library system only.  Thus, lending through the public library system will be subject to the public lending remuneration scheme when an operational lending scheme is established under regulations to be made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on foot of this Bill.My Department has been in close contact with officials at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the introduction of an operational lending scheme in respect of books in Ireland.  From these contacts, it is clear that much work has already been completed in respect of the development of a public lending scheme.  It is equally clear that the books lending scheme will be administered on the Minister's behalf by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, the statutory agency for public library development in Ireland.  Work on the administration of the scheme will be completed in 2008 with a view to making payments to authors in 2009.Under the scheme, authors will receive a royalty payment for the lending of their books through the public library system.  This is intended to compensate authors in some way for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in public libraries.  The scheme will be publicly funded by the Exchequer and will not involve any charge to borrowers at the point of lending in libraries.Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill, when enacted, as the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Act 2007 and outlines the collective citations having regard to earlier Acts being amended.Section 2 indicates that the principal Act being amended is the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Act.  Section 3 amends section 8 of the 2000 Act by allowing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to lay regulations and orders made under the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Section 4 amends section 9 of the 2000 Act by providing that expenses incurred by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the administration of a public lending remuneration scheme will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.Section 5 amends section 40 of the 2000 Act by making the act of lending copies of a work an exclusive right which vests with the copyright owner.Section 6 amends section 42 of the 2000 Act and allows for the replacement of the exclusive lending right with that of a right to remuneration where a scheme of remuneration for the public lending of copyright works for that category of works is in place.  The exclusive right will cease once a remuneration scheme is in place regardless of whether the author is a participant in the scheme.  In other words, there is no intention to have a mix of rights; once a scheme is in place, the exclusive rights simply cease to exist.Section 7 inserts a new section in the 2000 Act.  It establishes the legal basis for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations establishing a public lending remuneration scheme and sets out that any such scheme will be publicly funded out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The provision sets out, although not exhaustively, the criteria to be covered in regulations to be made by the Minister, such as the manner of participation in the scheme, the rates of remuneration to be paid to authors, the minimum and maximum amounts payable to a participating author etc. Section 8 amends section 58 of the 2000 Act by removing the exemption under the 2000 Act which exonerates public libraries from the need to remunerate authors for the public lending of their copyright works.  This was the provision objected to by the European Commission in the legal proceedings instigated against Ireland.  While the exemption relating to public libraries is being removed, the position of educational establishments remains unchanged in that the exemption for these establishments continues.Section 9 proposes to repeal section 69 of the 2000 Act and is a logical consequence of the amendment being made in section 5 of the Bill to section 40 of the 2000 Act.  Section 10 amends section 205 of the 2000 Act.  Performers are dealt with in a separate part of the 2000 Act and this provision confers an exclusive lending right on performers in respect of the public lending of recordings of their works.Section 11 amends section 207 of the 2000 Act and allows for the replacement of the exclusive lending right in respect of recordings to that of a right to remuneration in respect of works which are publicly lent where a remuneration scheme for that category of works is in place.Section 12 amends section 226 of the 2000 Act by removing the exemption under the 2000 Act which exonerates public libraries from the need to remunerate performers in respect of the public lending of the recordings of their performances.  As is the case under section 8, while the exemption relating to public libraries is being removed, the position of educational establishments remains unchanged in that the exemption for these establishments will continue as before.Section 13 amends section 320 of the 2000 Act.  As a consequence of the amendment being made in section 8 of the Bill, section 58 of the Principal Act and the orders made under that section are fundamentally amended.  As sections 320(2) and (3) of the 2000 Act refer to establishments prescribed by the Minister under section 58 which will no longer have any relevance upon passage of this legislation, this language is being removed from section 320.Section 14 amends section 79 of the Local Government Act 2001 and provides a statutory basis for An Chomhairle Leabharlanna to administer a public lending remuneration scheme on behalf of the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.I have outlined the contents of the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007.  I am satisfied that the Bill will not only bring Ireland into compliance with our EU commitments but it will also preserve the position of libraries as essential gateways to vast stores of humanity's recorded knowledge and information while compensating, in some way, the authors who contribute to that knowledge store.  As significant players representing their users, libraries assume a pivotal role in ensuring that the public interest represented by society's need for knowledge is recognised as a priority and appropriately balanced against copyright holders' legal and moral rights.I commend the Bill to the House.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Fine Gael accepts the Bill.  It will introduce a public lending right to protect the intellectual property of writers and artists who ensure that a further remuneration scheme is in place to pay royalties to these people.  This change should have been made some time ago.  As the Minister has admitted it is only coming forward now as a result of enforcement proceedings under Article 228 of the consolidated treaties.  If the Bill is not adopted obviously the Government will face action before the European Court of Justice, resulting in fines, the cost of which will fall on the taxpayer.  For this reason we will co-operate with the speedy passage of the Bill.However, as a future point, although I appreciate the Union is becoming more effective at enforcement proceedings and such proceedings are happening much faster than in the past, at the same time we will see the Government responding to reasoned opinions faster than in the past.  I accept we are doing better than most of our European neighbours in terms of transposing legislation but we need to do better.  Unfortunately, but for the failure of the constitution, which would have given the Union a legal personality and would have allowed European legislation to effectively become federal legislation, we would not have to undergo this process.  It looks as if we are stuck with that for the time being, at least until we can revisit the constitution at a future point.I wish to address the Government's record on copyright.  In doing my research I came across emergency legislation in 2004 where the Government had paid €12.6 million for the James Joyce papers including early drafts of Finnegan’s Wake but could not exhibit them in the National Library due to breach of copyright law.  This does not seem to be the first time we have had to rush through emergency legislation because the Government has not got it right the first time around.There are a few questions that need to be raised.  I note the cost estimates, €600,000 as set-up and €1 million as the annual cost.  I would be interested to hear the basis for those figures and how they are calculated and whether there are any projects for the years ahead.  If the cost is €1.1 million in the first full year what will happen after that and how will the Minister be held to account?  Who will be held to account if those figures prove to be incorrect or inaccurate as they so often do?I note the Bill will separate into maximum and minimum remuneration levels but I do not know exactly how the royalties will be negotiated — if there will be negotiation or if they will be decided upon by another body.  Section 79 provides that they be paid by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.  Will that money come directly from central Government and then be paid out by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna or will the money come from some other source or from local authorities?  I am concerned that at some point it will fall on local authorities yet again to pick up the bill.  Those of us who come from the council are conscious of the extent to which central Government has imposed on local government, by increasing demands to produce services and making payouts to other bodies, yet has consistently refused to bring in real local government reform and reform on the financing of local government.  I am concerned that if we do not have a guarantee that this will come from Central Funds that this cost will fall on local government as well.I am interested to know if the Bill in any way affects the position of the copyright libraries, the National Library and Trinity College Library, and if they will still be entitled to copies of literature as they were in the past.  Has that right been altered in any way?Local government projections for 2010 show a €1.6 billion shortfall in local government funding.  If this cost falls to local government and to local government libraries there is a risk that the cost will fall to people borrowing books.  Certainly we do not want that to happen.  I would welcome a reassurance from the Minister in that regard.It was stated that educational institutions will be exempt and their state will not be affected.  What is happening increasingly in Ireland, and it is a good development, is the co-locating of many of our public services.  In one part of my constituency a primary school and a secondary school on the same campus share a library which is not only an education institutional library but is also a community lending library.  The community centre is also the school hall.  This is a very good model for developing new communities but how can we ensure that this library, which is the school library and the public lending library, is exempt, or is it?  Has provision been made for that in the legislation?  If I get satisfactory answers to those questions we will be happy to support the Bill and to wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.Authors and artists deserve recognition for their work and the House should be happy to ensure they get their fair share.  I hope that with the passage of the Bill the Government will take seriously the vital work that libraries perform not just as an educational service but as a social service.  As often happens with post offices and schools they can become part of our community.  At budget time I trust the Minister will make it clear to the Minister for Finance that funding must be provided to finance this Bill and ensure it comes entirely from Central Funds.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	142	On behalf of the Labour Party we too will want to facilitate the passage of this legislation.  The Government is tardy in bringing forward this legislation although it had been precipitated by the EU Commission in its instigation in June 2007 of enforcement proceedings against Ireland under Article 228 of the EEC treaty. A recent opinion has been given and as Ireland has only a few months to respond, time is of the essence.  As Deputy Varadkar said, the people who will pay for this if it is not implemented in a timely fashion will be the ordinary taxpayers who will pick up the tab for the Government's delay in introducing the legislation.  While in the 2000 Act the Government may have taken a short-term view of saving money over a number of years, the fine would wipe that away very quickly.The Labour Party welcomes the advent of the legislation in the Dáil and we will co-operate with its passage subject to a number of observations, comments and proposed amendments which we believe will improve the Bill.  I will set them out here and I hope the departmental officials will consider them.  Some of them have already been canvassed in the Seanad by our spokesperson, Senator Alex White.  They did not seem to get the response I thought might have been forthcoming from the Minister of State.  It is important that the legislation follows a belt and braces approach so that any lacunae or deficiencies, which we feel are apparent, should be remedied now.  A stitch in time saves nine is the old proverb and it should be applied to legislation also.  Just because amendments emanate from the Opposition, they should not be pooh-poohed as they may be worthy of inclusion.  Having entered those caveats, we hope it will be quickly passed.The legislation has been long awaited and has received a broad welcome from, among others, the Irish Writers' Union, as it provides a legal framework for a public lending right to pay writers whose books are borrowed through public libraries.  It appears that details of the scheme will be included in later regulations that will emanate from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as it is clear that public libraries and the Library Council, An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, fall under the remit of that Department.  Those regulations obviously will be introduced by way of statutory instrument.  We would like to understand how they will be formulated.  There are issues regarding the membership of an advisory council.  Those are important issues we need to thrash out and we would like to get a preview of the intentions of the Minister of State in order to ensure that the relevant parties are involved in an advisory role and can make an input.  Those are the people at the coalface and we must ensure they are included.In so far as one can ascertain, this legislation has its origin as far back as 1992 when the European Directive on Lending Rights came into being.  Then began a significant process of campaigns and pressure by the Public Lending Rights International Network and the European Writers' Congress which culminated in a European Court of Justice decision in January 2007, C-175/05, which declared that Ireland by exempting all public libraries from paying public lending rights under the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 failed to comply with the 1992 directive and in essence was acting unlawfully, which is why we are here today.It is important that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg, as public libraries play a very important and central role in promoting reading and in the promotion of Irish literature.  They also promote the educational value of reading and the dissemination of information especially among elderly people, but also among the young.  It is one of the places they get their first exposure to reading.  It is an important educational tool as well as providing general knowledge.It is crucial that the public lending rights be funded by the Exchequer and not from public library budgets.  One cannot but laud the role of local authorities, whose centrality to the provision and maintenance of public libraries cannot be underestimated.  As a member of a local authority in times of straitened finances, I recall clearly the great debates on trying to save money.  Councillors always adopted a proactive role in trying to provide finances in times of great scarcity over the years which was essential to keep those libraries going.  I acknowledge the role over the years of the county librarians and their excellent staff, who played pivotal roles in this regard.The Labour Party believes that the Exchequer should provide the funding as to do otherwise would diminish the already scarce resources of the public libraries.  As they already operate on shoestring budgets, it is important that nothing be done in the passage of this legislation that might diminish the finance available to them.  The public lending rights will offer support to authors, many of whose works are not promoted, as the large multinational chains clearly concentrate on a small number of big names and bestsellers.  Libraries often offer such authors the best chance of exposure as they have a wide selection of books available, including many out of print titles.The payment will assist Irish writers, many of whom are unable to earn a living from writing alone.  Some writers have been very successful over the years as mentioned by the Minister of State.  For all the successful writers we have, there are many others who do not earn very much.  It is important that they are helped out in that regard.  We must ensure they continue to practise their craft and skills in writing.  The United Kingdom imposes an annual cap of approximately £6,000 on the amount an individual can earn from a public lending right, which ensures that for very successful writers the payment does not become lopsided.  Some Irish writers probably benefit from the UK public lending right payment scheme, which is operated here by the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency.  It is clear that the introduction of this scheme will open up an ancillary benefit for writers in other countries.  Reciprocal arrangements will be in place with other countries and I am sure some of our writers will gain under that aspect also.The legislation primarily deals with books.  While I am not a technological person, there are videos, DVDs and other technological ways of dissemination of material.  I ask the Minister of State to address the copyright issues that will arise regarding the lending of these.  I am sure he has paid attention to the issue and has a view on it.Section 7 inserts a new section in the 2000 Act enabling the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations to establish a public lending remuneration scheme and sets out that any such scheme be funded out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It also sets out the rates of remuneration, including minimum and maximum amounts payable to participating authors.  The lack of a commencement order appears to be a potentially serious flaw in the Bill.  The Bill as it stands commences on enactment, which means that the existing exemption for lending by libraries etc. will be repealed.  However, as it will take time for the regulations to be formulated under section 7, it would seem to leave libraries in a legal limbo in the meantime.  To remedy this lacuna a commencement provision is required to allow section 7 to operate immediately but the repeals only to come into operation on the making of regulations.  Otherwise libraries might be forced to stop lending books until regulations are made.  While this proposal is not the be-all and end-all, the Minister of State should investigate it.Section 8 repeals section 58 of the 2000 Act, removing the exemption which exonerated public libraries from the need to remunerate authors for the public lending of their copyright works.  This is the section to which the European Commission objected.  As the Minister of State said, the position of educational establishments in this framework is important.  These will obviously now not be included in the public lending right remuneration scheme and will continue to enjoy the exemption from the public lending right, which is important.  Will there be an interregnum period?  What will happen between the passage of the Act and the commencement by way of regulations?  Let us not fall between two stools.  I say this in a generous and positive way, and do not mean to be obstructive in any way.  Ireland has had numerous success stories, including Wilde, Shaw, Yeats and Joyce and we have been very lucky.I refer to the proposed advisory committee.  Approximately 50 writers could earn their living from writing and the royalties payable under the scheme will be of some help in this regard.  It is crucially important to establish what will be in the statutory instrument and it will also be important to ascertain whether the advisory body will be similar to its counterpart in the United Kingdom.  I ask the Minister to ensure such an advisory committee will be representative of writers' groups such as the Irish Writers' Union, which has campaigned for the introduction of this legislation for a considerable time.  It is important that a group of its status be consulted to ensure the inclusion of one of its representative on the advisory body the Minister intends to set up.We are eager to facilitate the passage of the Bill but attention must be paid to a number of issues.  One of our legal advisers suggests an amendment that the collective citation, Local Government Acts 1925-2007 should include Part 3.  This is a drafting amendment designed to update the collective citation.  The Water Services Act 2007 creates a collective citation of these Acts, even though it has not commenced.  However, its collective citation does not require commencement and, therefore, is deemed to have commenced on enactment.  Unless our amendment is accepted, anomalies could arise in referring to the Local Government Acts in future, as there would be two inconsistent citations for them.  That is important to ensure the law is clear, concise and precise.  We welcome the Bill and we will facilitate its passage.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this new legislation, which is welcome.  It is only fair that we should always protect and defend our writers, authors, musicians and artists.  Ireland was once known as the land of saints and scholars but, sadly, that has radically changed on many issues.  We need to refocus our vision of society and the direction we are headed as a country.  Part of this debate centres on how our authors are treated and the difficulties they face in the modern, changing world.  The legislation is an important element in assisting them going forward.The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a public lending right that will provide authors initially with an exclusive right with regard to the lending of their works in public libraries, which can be replaced by the right to remuneration when the public lending remuneration scheme is in place.  The Bill contains 13 sections and it is not contentious. It was well received on Second Stage in the Seanad, which is welcome.  The legislation will regularise Ireland's position in providing recognition for authors and royalty payments for the lending of their books, which the State is duty bound to recognise under EU law, which is positive.However, the Government always has to react to EU law.  Are we not confident, as a nation, to protect and assist our authors and artists without having to be told to do so by the Union?  This is a constant issue in protecting the rights of our people, which should happen regardless.  The rights of writers or any other members in society should always be a matter of fact.  As legislators, we should lead on this issue and we should not always have to be directed by the Union to protect specific sectors and citizens in society.  It is important to support and develop the skills of artists, particularly those who do not earn significant money.  However, those who do have a responsibility to the country and their audience to stay in the country and pay taxes like the rest of us.  Jumping ship to base oneself in another country to make more money smacks of greed and should be challenged by Members.  I raise this because many writers and artists, particularly those earning less than €50,000 per annum support that position.  It is important to recognise the vast majority do not make a great deal of money but they make a massive contribution to the country.  We only hear of those who win international competitions now and again but many creative people living on the north side of Dublin make a significant contribution to the discipline of writing.Public libraries provide great examples of their use and good practice.  Over the past 20 years I have used their services on literacy projects in the arts and music for disadvantaged pupils.  Poor children have an early opportunity to be exposed to the wonders of books and the arts.  These services need to be promoted to help the development of young writers and so on and libraries play a significant part.  Young children use libraries to access books, the arts and information technology to develop their skills and this needs to be defended and protected.More creativity is needed, particularly in disadvantaged areas where many people are excluded from the arts.  Many disadvantaged schools have made a contribution to the development of writing, poetry, music and other artistic disciplines and they do excellent work with children in these areas.  There is massive potential to develop their literary skills.  If children with reading difficulties are encouraged to participate in the arts at a young age, it could have a massive impact on their lives.  Reading poetry in front of other children helps them to develop their skills and that is important to literacy projects.  Many of them said in September that they could not read or did not like reading but, at the same time, they were exposed to positive development in their local libraries and highlighting these services is crucial.  These children were given an opportunity to change their lives and libraries must be supported on this issue.Section 5 amends section 40 of the principal Act and provides for an exclusive lending right to be exercised by the author.  Section 6 amends section 42 of the principal Act to set out that an exclusive lending right applies in respect of the public lending of copyright works unless and until a remuneration scheme is otherwise in place.  Section 7 enables the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations to establish a public lending remuneration scheme.  The scheme will be publicly funded out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The provision sets out, although not exhaustively, the criteria to be covered in regulations, for example, the manner of participating in the scheme, rates of remuneration, minimum and maximum amounts payable to a participating author etc.I welcome the funding of the public lending scheme by the Exchequer and it will involve funding both the administration of the scheme through An Chomhairle Leabharlanna and making annual payments to authors in respect of the lending of their works.  The initial cost will be approximately €600,000.  It is anticipated that this figure will include accommodation and refurbishment costs for An Chomhairle Leabharlanna and IT software costs.  It is also anticipated that ongoing annual costs will be incurred in the region of €1.1 million to cover both the administration of the scheme and the payments to authors.  Looking at the figures of €600,000 and €1.1 million, one is conscious that this is a major investment and we must be very aware of public funds.  Nonetheless, I ask whether sufficient money is available for this section and if the €1.1 million will be enough to resource that package.  It is important, as I said, to focus on the responsibilities of the broader vision on this issue.  We must protect our writers and ensure they are looked after.  We also have to protect those who work and develop the services because of the many developments that have taken place over a number of years.I have mentioned the good practices in some of our local libraries such as Coolock, for example, and Raheny which have made a massive contribution towards improving literacy levels and skills among young people on the north side of Dublin.  However, we must accept the reality that many public libraries are an enormous local resource for people and schools that do not necessarily have many resources at times.  The sad reality is that without the involvement of these schools with their local libraries many children would not have the opportunity of using these services.  I raise this on the legislation because these matters are all indirectly connected.  It is not acceptable to have young people who do not get the same opportunity as middle class children, perhaps, when it comes to writing, the arts, music and the literacy base that many in their age groups have.  The key is to ensure this country, once known as the island of saints and scholars, develops a respect for its writers and authors and also transforms the level of interest in this area.  There are children and young people who are very interested in the arts and writing and we must ensure their potential is developed.  As I mentioned there are examples of good practice where some progressive schools with high literacy problems, particularly in poor areas, invite writers and poets in and use their skills to develop respect for literature among children as well as reading skills.  This is something all schools should learn from as well as all politicians including Members of the Oireachtas.I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill as a positive development in the way we treat writers and authors in this country.  There are some very progressive sections in the legislation.  The only concern I have relates to the resourcing of €1.1 million.  I hope that money is adequate, but it is important to take the broader vision of respecting the work of our writers and artists.  Only a few of them make it onto the international stage but the vast majority make massive contributions in their own communities.  We have many good authors on the north side of Dublin who make enormous contributions to their local communities in Coolock, Darndale, Marino and such places.  They might not all necessarily make the headlines, but their contributions are worthy.  They can be involved in local history projects etc. and deserve to be included in this debate.  I welcome and support the legislation.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I welcome the publication of this Bill but I am disappointed that it took a case to the European Court of Justice for it to be produced.  Certainly, in Ireland there is a rich heritage of literature, from W.B. Yeats to Oscar Wilde.  More recent famous writers include Roddy Doyle and Anne Enright, who had such a great success with her book, The Gathering, in winning the Booker prize.  We have a rich heritage of literature and should do all we can to protect it.Artists and writers need recognition for the great work they do.  The stories they tell brighten up people's lives and in any event they deserve a fair return for their intellectual investment.  This copyright protection Bill will help to ensure that happens.  In 1979 the UK Government introduced legislation which provided that an author received some compensation when his or her book was borrowed from a library.It is disappointing that this initiative has been fomented by European legislation and that we have not introduced it previously.  The Bill is obviously beneficial to authors.  Public libraries certainly provide a valuable service within communities.  As Deputy Finian McGrath indicated, there are some great staff in Raheny and Coolock libraries.  They have projects on an ongoing basis with students from the local schools encouraged to visit the libraries.  There are few better ways for youngsters to spend their time.  We hear too much about anti-social behaviour plaguing communities.  Given the resources available it is important that people make the fullest use of public libraries.  I commend the staff of the libraries who provide such great amenities for all the youngsters and schools in my area of Dublin North-East.  The Minister of State might keep in mind that libraries provide a great social contact point for communities, similar in effect to post offices around the country.  We should endeavour to make more public libraries available throughout this city and country.As regards the costs of the scheme and the backdating of royalty payments, will the Minister of State say whether the calculations will go back a number of years or will the scheme come into effect from 2009 onwards?

Also, how many staff will be needed to administer the scheme, or will all be done centrally using an automatic system?  Will there be a need for extra administration?  As regards royalty payments to authors, will that be done electronically or by cheque?  How long will it take before an author is paid?  Will he or she be paid on a yearly or quarterly basis?Section 10 of the Bill relates to the public lending of recordings and works and royalty payments to authors.  Does that include CDs and DVDs in libraries?  In Raheny library there is a good supply of CDs and DVDs.  Obviously there is room for more modern titles, but there is a considerable stock of CDs and DVDs, and will authors be compensated, accordingly?  Certainly, Fine Gael is satisfied with the Bill, which will bring us into line with the EU.As regards the pirate market, I am aware that there is door to door selling of DVDs in certain parts of my constituency.  The authors concerned are losing out on copyright protection and as regards CDs it is estimated that music artists throughout the world are losing out on billions of euro.  Are there plans to introduce new legislation in that area as well?  In China, for example, the estimated value of the pirate market is $591 million, while in Russia it is $332 million.  This is a considerable amount of money that artists are losing out on.We certainly have a rich literary heritage, of which we are rightly very proud.  It is important that writers' livelihoods be protected.  This legislation will help and they will receive the payment they deserve for their work.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I welcome the Bill and welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A number of Members have spoken about the genesis of the Bill.  While it was unfortunate that it was necessitated by a Council directive, it is welcome that the Minister of State and Department have taken the initiative to introduce it and protect Irish authors.  Members have spoken adequately about our extensive literary tradition, which dates back generations, and how it has allowed the Irish, a nation of scholars, to present themselves in overseas markets.  It is important that this legislation be enacted to show that the State supports those who develop literary content.In the modern age, the focus is not so much on books, magazines and papers as on the Internet.  The Internet is ultimately no different to the paper used in books in that it is merely a mechanism for transmitting content.  It is vital that we think more about content than the means by which it is transmitted because this allows us to focus on the individuals who create it.  It is critical that we continue to recognise their input.  With the advent of the Internet, we tend to forget the creativity, flair and artistic endeavour of authors.  It is important that their entitlements and capacity to find gainful employment and receive adequate remuneration for their work be protected.  This legislation achieves this and protects them against the loss of sales arising from the lending of their books in the public library system.It is important to recognise the comprehensive work public libraries do through the county councils and it is fitting to recognise the role of the county librarian in this regard.  The county librarian in County Clare, Noel Crowley, has done immense work to provide adequate funding to develop the library system throughout the county.  I am sure the same applies in many other counties.  Over the past four or five years in my constituency, there has been significant investment to ensure the library system is not confined solely to the county town and that outreach locations are adequately stocked with books and have Internet access.  Efforts have been made to keep books in a modern and well-maintained location.Very shortly a new library will open in Scarriff in the centre of east Clare.  It will be part of a new local area office.  The incorporation of libraries into local offices by local authorities represents good and careful use of public finances.  It ensures the public will be more familiar with the work of their local authority in that, by utilising the library housed under the same roof, they might visit the local authority office more regularly.The library service has perhaps been under-resourced for many years.  The investment that is now being made is welcome and helps to put knowledge and culture at the centre of our learning experience.  While this is being done, it is important that the Department recognises those who make libraries possible, namely the authors who continue to make information available.  It is only right that we continue to ensure that necessary resources are made available.Members have referred to the requirement for adequate finance to implement this legislation.  While we recognise that the Minister of State has indicated the legislation will not be retrospective, I am sure authors have a view on this.  It is welcome that a decision has been made to ensure they will be remunerated in the future.  It is important to ensure the existence of adequate funding to compensate them, in a real way, for the potential losses that will result from customers borrowing their books from libraries rather than purchasing them.I support the Minister wholeheartedly in his efforts to ensure the centrality of the author and hope the necessary funding will be put in place to ensure the continuation of the valuable experience we all remember from our first opportunity to attend a public library and borrow books that added to our learning experience.  Perhaps it helped some more than others.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I thank Deputies Varadkar, Penrose, Finian McGrath, Terence Flanagan and Dooley for their positive contributions and support for this legislation.  I concur with their comments on the social importance of libraries to urban and rural communities.A number of questions were raised by Deputies during their contributions.  These questions are such that there is no need for a Committee Stage, but we will have to have it anyhow.  Deputy Varadkar's first question related to the annual cost to the Exchequer of the proposed scheme.  The set-up cost is estimated to be €911,294 and the annual cost is expected to be €1,180,403, of which it is estimated that approximately €846,000 will go to authors.I was asked whether specific provision would be made from public funds.  The question of appropriate provision will be raised in the context of the public service Estimates for 2008 and a commitment was made to fund the scheme from the Exchequer.I was asked how much each author would receive per book lent.  The total is estimated to amount to €846,000 and the estimate per book is expected to be approximately 15 cent per loan.  This will apply to 42% of all loans and is based on the UK experience.  In the United Kingdom, approximately 5p or 6p is paid per loan and there is a ceiling of £6,600 per author.  All the regulations in the Irish system will be determined by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Deputy Varadkar also questioned what will happen where there is a library on a school campus.  Trinity College serves as an example in this regard and it will continue to be exempt from the provisions on public lending as it comes under the definition of an educational establishment.  This is also the case for primary and secondary schools.  In respect of Deputy Penrose's question about the operation of the system, an advisory committee will be established which will advise on policy and the operation of the system.  The make-up of the committee will include authors, editors and illustrators so it will embrace people from a wide range of sectors.The proposed scheme is modelled on the well established scheme in the UK.  Authors will be required to register their personal details, such as name and address, and other details such as the title and date of publication of each book for which they wish to claim public lending rights.  The amount of money to be paid to each registered author will be calculated by multiplying the rate per loan by the number of loans.  A minimum and a maximum payment will be set.  An Chomhairle Leabharlanna has negotiated with the registrar of the public lending rights office in the UK for the use of its computer software, which will save on development time and money.A question was raised about how many authors would be likely to benefit.  It is difficult to estimate the number of authors who will register for the Irish scheme but there is no reason to think that the authors who have already registered in the UK will not do so in Ireland.  The UK system has approximately 33,000 living authors registered and we can expect a significant number of these authors to register in Ireland.There will also be authors in Ireland who are not already registered in the UK.  Each year, the Public Lending Rights office registers on average 1,300 new authors, with 4,000 titles and 11,000 titles from previously registered authors.  It is estimated that the Irish figures may follow this pattern.Deputy Penrose also raised the question of the legal position between the creation of an exclusive right at the point of enactment of this Bill and the creation of the public lending remuneration scheme.  It is the case that upon enactment, the exclusive right will be created which authors can exercise to prohibit the lending of their books in libraries.  However, we are legally advised that it is essential to facilitate the withdrawal by the European Commission of Article 228 proceedings pending against the State that this exclusive right is introduced as soon as possible.  It would, of course, be ideal if the scheme of remuneration of authors could be in place at the time of the enactment of the Bill but this is not realistic.  While our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are making significant progress in advancing arrangements for the scheme, it is not likely to be set up until 2008.Deputy Penrose also raised the question of the collective citation.  On Committee Stage in the Seanad, I accepted a Labour Party amendment regarding the collective citation.Deputy Finian McGrath raised a question about the development of the public library system.  This system continues to make a substantial contribution to furthering the national development plan objective of establishing an inclusive society in which all citizens can participate fully in the social and economic life of the country and to furthering the objectives set out in the Government's action plan on the information society.  There has also been a focus on serving multicultural communities and a report on a research project on this has recently been published.  New innovative ways of developing the library service are being explored, with a move away from stand-alone libraries towards more integrated library projects as part of one-stop-shop civic centres and arts and cultural centres.Mention was made of tardiness in bringing the legislation forward.  The existing Bill of 2000 was drafted under the legal advice available to the Government at that time.  It is only since the European Court of Justice decision in January that we are aware that this transposition was incorrect.  The Bill was drafted prior to the general election and would have been enacted prior to that if we did not go ahead and put ourselves to the trouble of getting re-elected.Deputy Terence Flanagan and other speakers raised a question about DVDs.  DVDs and so on will not be brought into the public lending scheme as this point, although the legislation allows them to be brought in at some future point.  Deputy Terence Flanagan specifically asked about the legality of what is happening with regard to the pirating of DVDs and CDs.  I acknowledge that there is a serious problem in that area but legal action is being taken against DVD pirates, with hefty fines being imposed on offenders.  In August 2007, the first jailing of a DVD pirate, who received six months' imprisonment in the District Court, took place.  This has been hailed by representatives of the recorded music industry as a powerful deterrent in the fight against piracy.I hope I have answered most of the questions raised and we will discuss on Committee Stage any other views, queries or suggestions of Members.  I again thank all the Deputies for their positive contributions.

Ba é seo an chead ráiteas dá leithead a cuireadh amach le beagnach 40 bliain.Ar ndóigh, ba é an príomh cinneadh a fógraíodh mar chuid den ráiteas ná go n-ullmhófar Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Is léir go bhfuil an-spéis ag daoine i ráiteasaí faoin nGaeilge.  Muna bhfuil spéis an an bhFreasúra ann is dócha gur fearr an rud a chur ar athló.  Is minic a bhíodh sé le cloisint roimhe seo nach raibh aon straitéis no plean fadtéarmach náisiúnta ann don Ghaeilge agus nach raibh aon fhís ag an Rialtas maidir le forbairt na Gaeilge don ghlúin atá amach romhainn.  Is chun dul i ngleic leis an ndúshlán sin gur chinn an Rialtas gur ceart straitéis 20 bliain a fhorbairt.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an straitéis nó an plean 20 Bliain seo ullmhaithe faoi cheann bliana.Má bhaineann an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge leis an aimsir atá amach romhainn, baineann go leor eile de thionscnaimh an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge leis an aimsir láithreach.  Ar ceann de na cinn is tabhachtaí ar fad daoibh sin tá an Acht Teanga atá ar an saol anois go maith os cionn ceithre bliana.Tá sé i gcéist go mbainfí amach spriocanna an Achta go príomha trí scéimeanna teanga a aontaítear idir mise mar Aire agus comhlachtaí poiblí aonair.  Is creat pleanála a bhfuil stádas reachtúil aige é scéim teanga go mbíonn tréimhse trí bliana aige agus a bhíonn le hathnuachan nuair a bhíonn an tréimhse trí bliana sin istigh.  Go dáta, tá 69 scéim teanga a chlúdaíonn 124 comhlacht poiblí, mo Roinn féin ina measc, daingnithe agam agus foilsithe.  Chomh maith le sin, tá 59 scéim teanga eile á bplé ag mo Roinn leis na comhlachtaí poiblí atá i gceist le súil go mbeidh siad daingnithe agus foilsithe a luaithe agus is féidir.  Ní fada anois go mbeidh tréimhsí na gcéad scéimeanna teanga a d'aontaíodh istigh agus tá mo Roinn ag díriú anois ar an gcur chuige cur ceart a bheith againn agus an dara babhta de scéimeanna a athnuachan againn leis na comhlachtaí poiblí lena mbaineann siad.Leagtar síos in alt 9(1) den Acht gur féidir liom mar Aire rialacháin a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla i bhfógairtí béil, ar stáiseanóireachta, ar chomharthaíocht nó ar fhógráin.  Anuraidh leag mé os comhair gach Teach den Oireachtas dréacht-rialacháin a bhain le húsáid na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla ag comhlachtaí poiblí i bhfógairt béil réamh-thaifeadta, ar stáiseanóireacht agus ar chomharthaíocht.  Ghlac an Dáil agus an Seanad ar aon leis na dréacht-rialacháin seo ar 14 Nollaig 2006.  Ina dhiaidh sin, agus ar mholadh ó bhall den choiste, an Seanadóir O'Toole, scríobh mó Roinn chuig gach comhlacht poiblí atá clúdaithe ag an Acht chun deis eile a thabhairt dóibh a gcuid tuairimí a nochtadh faoina dréacht-rialacháin sular shínigh mé iad.  Tá an próiseas comhairliúcháin sin críochnaithe anois agus tá mé ag súil go mbeidh mé in ann na rialacháin a dhéanamh go han-luath tar éis tuilleadh plé leis an gcoiste cuí.  Níl mé ag rá go bhfuil moill ann ach sin an fáth nach bhfuil siad daingnithe agam. Shíl mé go mb'fhearr dul ar ais chuig an coiste agus cur i láthair a dhéanamh faoina haighneachtaí a fuair mé agus ansin a rá deis a thabhairt don choiste a thuairimí a nochtadh faoina gníomhaíochtaí atá i gceist a thógáil de thoradh na n-aighneachtaí seo.I mí Iúil 2003, síníodh an tAcht ina dhlí agus tá gach cuid de i bhfeidhm ó mhí Iúil anuraidh.  Is fiú dúinn breathnú siar ar an phointe seo agus féachaint cén tionchar a bhí ag an Acht go dtí seo, go mór-mhór ó thaobh mar atá sé imithe i bhfeidhm ar chomhlachtaí poiblí.  Díol spéise ar leith a bhí ann domsa a fheiceáil le déanaí gur fhógair an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí go raibh painéal ar leith le bunú ag an tseirbhís de dhaoine le líofacht sa Ghaeilge i bpríomh-ghráid earcaíochta na Státseirbhíse — i. oifigeach cléireachais agus oifigeach feidhmiúcháin.  Is cinnte gur dul chun cinn suntasach é seo a léiríonn go bhfuil an tAcht ag dul i bhfeidhm i gceart ar chomhlachtaí poiblí.  Tuigeann comhlachtaí poiblí anois gur ann do phobal na Gaeilge, gur mian leo leas a bhaint as seirbhísí Gaeilge ach iad a bheith ar fáil, agus mar sin, gur gá do na comhlachtaí féin dóthain bhall foirne le Gaeilge a bheith acu chun freastal a dhéanamh ar an éileamh sin.  Tréaslaím leis An tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí as na comórtais seo a reachtáil.  Tá sé tábhachtach anois a chinntiú go mbeidh líon mór iarrthóirí istigh ar na comórtais mar tá na poist ann.Ag féachaint romhainn is fiú dúinn a bheith ag smaoineamh anois ar sciar nó céatadán áirithe do phoist nó folúntais de chuid na seirbhíse poiblí a bheith líonta le daoine cáilithe a bhfuil líofacht sa Ghaeilge acu, chomh maith le Béarla, bíodh siad laistigh no lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.Tá léargas tugtha agam sa Teach seo go minic faoi na nithe atá curtha i gcrích agus mar sin níl i gceist agam iad a liostáil anseo arís.  Ó tharla áfach go bhfuil an cheist ardaithe sna meáin arís le cúpla lá anuas, agus go deimhin go bhfuil ceist Dála faoi ón Teachta O'Shea inniu, ba mhaith liom tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh uair amháin eile don chostas a bhaineann le haistriúcháin.Ba mhaith liom a mhíniú arís eile gurb é an t-aon dualgas reachtúil atá ar chomhlachtaí poiblí faoi láthair maidir le haistriú cáipéisí go Gaeilge ná an dualgas a thiteann orthu faoi alt 10 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003.  Faoi alt 10, tá dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí cionroinnt an-teoranta d'eochair-cáipéisí a aistriú, mar shampla, tuarascálacha bliantúla agus cáipéisí a leagann amach tograí beartais phoiblí ar nós páipéir uaine no bán.  Is eochair-cáipéisí iad seo ina bhfuil comhlachtaí poiblí freagrach don gnáth-phobal, dá gcustaiméirí, agus dúinne mar Bhaill den Oireachtas maidir le comhlíonadh a ndualgas poiblí.Tá dhá theanga oifigiúil sa tír seo agus feictear domsa — go deimhin, bhí gach éinne sa Teach seo ar aon intinn faoi seo nuair a bhí an tAcht seo á phlé againn mar Bhille — go bhfuil an ceart ag an saoránach cáipéisí don chineál seo a bheith ar fáil sa dá theanga oifigiúil.  Comhionannas i soláthar seirbhís phoiblí atá ann.  Go deimhin, ní mór dom a rá chomh maith gur iarradh orm, le linn na díospóireachta ar an mBille, glacadh le leasúcháin a chiallódh go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar chomhlachtaí réimse níos leithne de dhoiciméid a fhoilsiú go dátheangach agus go comhuaineach, ach nár ghlacas leis na leasaithe a moladh.Gan amhras, níl sa chostas aistriúcháin ach céatadán beag den chostas iomlán a bhaineann le doiciméid den chineál seo a chur ar fáil agus go deimhin is costas suarach agus fánach é i gcomhthéacs buiséad riaracháin formhór na gcomhlachtaí poiblí.  Is amhlaidh, áfach, go dtarraingíonn costais aistriúcháin aird ar leith mar gur cosúil nach mbíonn sé de acmhainn ag go leor comhlachtaí seirbhís aistriúcháin a sholáthar iad féin agus gur gá dóibh mar sin leas a bhaint as saineolas ón dtaobh amuigh.  Tá bealaí éifeachtacha ann chun costais a laghdú, go háirithe má chuirtear na cáipéisí ar fáil ar an Idirlíon le híoslódáil seachas an iomarca cóipeanna a chur i gcló.Tarraingíodh aird ar an ábhar seo níos luaithe an tseachtain seo i gcás Comhairle Contae Chorcaigh agus tá sé suntasach go bhfuil tuairisc sa nuachtán laethúil Gaeilge inniu ag tuairisciú go ndearna 3,667 duine leagan Gaeilge de na pleananna áitiúla i gContae Chorcaigh a íoslódáil, saor in aisce ó shuíomh Idirlín na comhairle.  Cén fáth a mbacfadh éinne leis an chóip chrua a fháil nuair tá sé in ann dul isteach agus an píosa atá uaidh a íoslódáil?  Faighim go leor de na tuarascálacha seo sa phost agus dá mbeinn chun iad uilig a léamh, bheadh an oifig lán.  Má bhíonn an tuarascáil de dhíth orm arís, téim ar líne agus faighim an chuid den tuarascáil atá uaim.  Tá laghdú mór ar na cáipéisí atá ag dul amach i gcóip-chrua ag Airí agus is rud maith sin.  Tá chóir a bheith gach tuarascáil bhliantúil ar fáil ar an Idirlíon anois.Anuas ar sin, ba mhaith liom a rá, mar atá a fhios ag na Teachtaí go rí-mhaith, go bhfuil méadú ar na meáin Ghaeilge le blianta beaga anuas, gan trácht ar mic léinn, srl., a bhaineann agus a bhainfidh úsáid rialta as na cáipéisí seo.  Ní fíor a rá agus ní ghlacaim leis gur beag an tairbhe don Ghaeilge agus do lucht labhartha agus úsáide na teanga cáipéisí dá leithead a bheith ar fáil i nGaeilge.  Is a mhalairt ar fad de thuairim a bheadh agam mar go dtugann siad deis don teanga téarmaíocht nua a chruthú agus cruthaíonn sé freisin gur féidir leis an teanga maireachtáil mar theanga bheo san saol teicneolaíochta, cumarsáide seo.I mí Mheitheamh na bliana 2005, chinn Comhairle na nAirí an Aontais Eorpaigh go mbeadh stádas mar theanga oifigiúil oibre de chuid an Aontais ag an nGaeilge ón gcéad lá d'Eanáir 2007.  Ar ndóigh, tháinig an chinneadh seo i bhfeidhm ag tús na bliana seo.  Baineadh amach an stádas seo don Ghaeilge tar éis feachtais láidir ón Rialtas a raibh tacaíocht aige ó na páirtithe uilig i nDáil Éireann agus ó eagraíochtaí Gaeilge mar Chonradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus Stádas.Roimhe seo, bhí conarthaí agus cáipéisí áirithe á n-aistriú go Gaeilge, ach as seo amach beidh i bhfad níos mó doiciméad i nGaeilge á gcur ar fáil.  Tá sé anois de cheart ag comhaltaí na hÉireann an Ghaeilge a labhairt sa Pharlaimint sna tosca ceanna ina labhraítear an 20 teanga oifigiúil eile de chuid an Aontais.  Beidh iarrthóirí ar phoist de chuid an Aontais in ann an Ghaeilge a chur san áireamh chun riachtanais teanga a chomhlíonadh ar an mbonn céanna le haon teanga oifigiúil eile.Tá an Rialtas ag obair le Coimisiúin na hEorpa chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na hacmhainn ar fáil chun freastal ar an stádas atá ag an nGaeilge.  Tá ciste ar leith bunaithe ag mo Roinn chun maoiniú a chur ar fáil le haghaidh sainchúrsaí tríú leibhéal sa Ghaeilge.  Cinnteoidh na sainchúrsaí seo go mbeidh leordhóthain ateangairí, aistritheoirí agus dlíodóirí-teangairí ar fáil chun freastal a dhéanamh ar riachtanais an Aontais Eorpaigh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.Chomh maith le sin, tá córas creidiúnaithe d'aistritheoirí forbartha ag Foras na Gaeilge ar iarratas uaimse.  Chomh maith le bheith ina áis thar a bheith tábhachtach ó thaobh chúrsaí aistriúcháin sa mbaile, beidh an córas seo ina chúnamh tábhachtach ó thaobh soláthar aistritheoirí Gaeilge don AE.  Tá dhá sheimineár reáchtáilte ag Foras na Gaeilge go dáta, i gcomhar le Coimisiún na hEorpa, chun aistritheoirí a chur ar an eolas faoi folúntais d'aistritheoirí Gaeilge sa Choimisiún.  Cheana féin, tá an caighdeán cuí faoin gcóras bainte amach ag 97 iarrthóir.Bhí go leor moltaí ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, ceann acu ná go dtabharfar stádas oifigiúl oibre don Ghaeilge, agus baineadh sin amach.  Bhí tuairim agus 20 moltaí i dtuarascáil Coimisiún na Gaeltachta agus tá formhór na moltaí sin curtha i bhfeidhm, nó gníomhachtaí sonracha tógtha orthu.  Maidir leis an staidéar teangeolaíochta, d'eascair sé sin as tuarascáil Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.  Tá dianstaidéar déanta againn air agus ar na moltaí atá ann.  Tá cuid acu inchurtha i bhfeidhm agus cuid eile a mbeidh deacair a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá deis gníomhú ar an cheist anois agus tá coiste comh-aireachta le bunú.  As seo go ceann bliana, beidh plean gníomhaíochta á réitiú.Tá plé mór le déanamh.  Tá dhá thaobh sa mheá.  Tá daoine ann a chreideann nach fiú ach díriú ar an bhfíor Ghaeltacht, mar a thugtar air, is é sin, na ceantair ina bhfuil ós cionn 67% den phobal ina gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge.  Ceaptar go mba ceart an iarracht ar fad a dhíriú ar na ceantair sin agus beag beann a dhéanamh de na cheantair eile.  Is teoiric spéisiúil í, ach is ceann teangeolaíoch í a bhfuil laige ag baint léi.  Tá sé thar a bheith spéísiúil nach maireann aon cheantar taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ina bhfuil aon rian de chainteoirí laethúla Ghaeilge a bheadh thar an meán, mar shampla, iarthar an Chláir, Béara nó sna ceantair ina raibh Gaeilge fairsing go maith nuair a bunaíodh an Stát, áiteanna a baineadh amach agus a cuireadh taobh amuigh de theorann na Gaeltachta.  Tá sin le feiceáil má thógann muid ceantair ina bhfuil, mar shampla, 40% den phobal ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil taobh amuigh den chóras oideachais.  Sin an t-uafás daoine le hais nó taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Má bhaintear an dream sin as an Ghaeltacht, tá cruthúnas láidir ann go n-ísleoidh siad iad féin an-tapaidh go dtí an leibhéal atá ar fáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.   Ní dócha gur sin a theastaíonn ó dhuine ar bith.Glacaim leis go gcaithfidh na pleananna díriú ar na ceantair Gaeltachta ar bhealaí éagsúla.  Ní chreidim, áfach, gur tairbhe na Gaeilge ná na Gaeltachta í ceantair ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge fós i bhfad níos láidre ná mar atá sí taobh amuigh dóibh a bheith bainte amach as an nGaeltacht.  Tá ceantair áfach, mar shampla Béal an Mhuiread, agus is féidir a rá chomh fada siar le 1966 gur beag an cás a bhí acu, fiú ag an am sin, iad a chur isteach sa Ghaeltacht.  Go deimhin, is beag an difríocht atá idir iad agus na ceantair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá cuid acu siúd i mo dháilceantar féin, thart ar chathair na Gaillimhe.  Tá ceist mhór le freagairt faoi na cheantair sin agus tá próiseas leagtha amach sa tuarascáil teangeolaíochta faoi cén chaoi is ceart díriú ar na ceantair sin.  Creidim go bhfuil fiúntas leis na moltaí sin, is é sin, go gcaithfidh na pobail sin rogha a dhéanamh, go gcaithfear plean a leagan amach agus deis a bheith acu an plean a chur i bhfeidhm.  Mura gcuirtear i bhfeidhm ansin é, is cóir go mbeidh siad taobh amuigh.  Má thograíonn siad gan plean a réiteach agus gan a bheith páirteach sa Ghaeltacht, caithfear cinneadh sciopaidh a dhéanamh.Creidim go bhfuil an-bhunús leis an chur chuige sa staidéar teangeolaíochta, ach do na ceantair a mbeidh sásta plean a réiteach agus a chur i bhfeidhm.  Caithfimid an oiread oibre a chur sna ceantair sin agus a cuirtear sna ceantair láidre Gaeltachta, ach é a dhéanamh ar bhealach éagsúil.  Sin an léamh atá agam as an staidéar teangeolaíochta.  Is cosúil, áfach, go bhfuil léamh eile ag daoine eile a chreideann nach ceart mórán a dhéanamh taobh amuigh de na ceantair láidre Gaeltachta.  Ní ghlacaim gur sin a bhí i gceist ag údar na tuarascála, ná gur leas na Gaeilge an cur chuige sin.  Creidim go bhfuil staidéar fíor-láidir ann gurb é a tharlódh sa chás sin ná go dtiocfadh meath an-sciopaidh ar na sciatha cosanta atá ag na bhforbartha, ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de, agus go lagfadh ansin an croí iontu, go mór mar nach mbeadh na ceantair idir eatharthu ann níos mó.Bhí sé thar a bheith spéisiúil dul thart ag Oireachtas na Gaeilge.  Bhí trí aicme duine ann, iad ar fad ag labhairt Gaeilge, an dream as an bhfíor-Ghaeltacht, go leor as na Gaeltachtaí nach bhfuil chomh láidir ach atá dílis don Ghaeilge, agus an-chuid daoine ó thaobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Bhí siad ar fad go sona sásta lena chéile ag labhairt na Gaeilge.

Ó tháinig tuairisc Choimisiún na Gaeltachta amach, tá cuid mhaith de na moltaí ann curtha i bhfeidhm.  Mar shampla, tá an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil agus mar theanga oibre san Eoraip.  Tá an Bille Teanga achtaithe de réir dlí chomh maith.  Dul chun cinn de chineál é sin, dar ndóigh.  Freisin, eisíodh preasráiteas ag deireadh na bliana seo caite i Farmleigh, an áit ar cuireadh straitéis ar mhaithe le chur chun cinn na Gaeilge chun tosach.  Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla cheist a chur ar an Aire faoi cad a tharla ó shin.Tá Fóram na Gaeilge ceaptha le comhairle agus treoir a thabhairt don Aire.  Cé chomh minic agus a thagann an fóram sin le chéile?  Cén uair a raibh an cruinniú deireannach acu agus cén uair a bheidh an chéad cruinniú eile acu?  Is é ceann de na freagraíochtaí a bhí ar Fhóram na Gaeilge ná moltaí a chur ar fáil don Aire agus don Roinn.  Cén moltaí a chuirfí i bhfeidhm nó cén moltaí atá ann don straitéis Gaeilge a bhí le cur ar fáil ar fud na tíre?  Ceann de na moltaí a bhí ann, ná go raibh státseirbhíseach le ceapadh ar a mbeadh sé de dhualgas iomlán air amharc i ndiadh an phlean straitéiseach.  An bhfuil an státseirbhíseach sin ceaptha nó an bhfuil a fhios againn cé hé nó cé hí?Bhí saineolaithe le ceapadh a mbeadh a gcuid tuairimí le fáil maidir leis an plean straitéiseach do chur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  An bhfuil na saineolaithe sin ceaptha?  An bhfuil siad in ann a gcuid tuairimí a chur i bhfeidhm agus an mbeidh na tuairimí sin sa phlean straitéiseach?  Dúradh ag an phreasagallamh i mí na Nollag anuraidh, go raibh an plean straitéiseach le bheith i bhfeidhm taobh istigh de dhá bhliain.  Tá bliain imithe agus tá sé le bheith i bhfeidhm i 2008.  An gciallaíonn sin an lá deireannach de 2008 nó an chéad lá?Cuireadh airgead ar fáil sa cháinfhaisnéis, €300,000, fá choinne an taighde uilig.  Céard a rinneadh leis an airgead sin?  Ar cuireadh ar fáil é, cé mhéad de atá caite agus an bhfuil cuid de fágtha go fóill?  Chomh maith le sin, dúradh go dtabharfar tacaíocht speisialta do thuismitheoirí a bhfuil fonn orthu a gcuid páistí a thógaint le Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ní faoin Ghaeltacht atáim ag caint go fóill, tiocfaidh mé chuici sin, ach faoin chuid eile den tír.  Tugadh an gheallúint sin do thuismitheoirí a raibh fonn orthu páistí a thógaint le Ghaeilge agus oideachas trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil dóibh sna gaelscoileanna.  Caithfidh mé admháil go bhfuil sár-obair á dhéanamh ag na gaelscoileanna.  Cibé a tharlós don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht fhéin, tá comharthaí dóchais go mairfidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga de thairbhe na hoibre atá á dhéanamh ag na gaelscoileanna.Tá deacrachtaí á gcruthú do na gaelscoileanna, áfach, i láthair na huaire.  Tá deacrachtaí cinnte á gcruthú do na gaelscoileanna ag comhghleacaí an Aire, déanaim tagairt go speisialta don Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta.  Is í an fhealsúnacht a bhí ag na gaelscoileanna go dtí seo ná go mbeadh gach ábhar á dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge ag na daltaí a rachadh isteach ag ceithre bhliana d'aois — an tumoideachas.  Anois tá an Aire i ndiaidh teacht trasna ar sin agus a rá go gcaithfidh na gaelscoileanna an Béarla a theagasc mar ábhar oifigiúl gach lá sna gaelscoileanna.  Tá conspóid mhór le sin.  Tá sé cruthaithe ag na gaelscoileanna, le leathchéad bliain anuas, go n-éiríonn leis an tumoideachas, agus níl easnamh Béarla ar aon dalta iontu ach an oiread.  Ba mhaith liom tuairimí an Aire a fháil.  Cad a shíleann sé den riail úr maidir leis an tumoideachas?  An gcaithfimid an Béarla a theagasc sa chéad dhá bhliain?  Tá sé sin iontach tábhachtach chomh maith.  Tá comharthaí dóchais ar fud na tíre.  Cathain a dtiocfaidh an straitéis i bhfeidhm?  An bhfuil an Státseirbhís réidh chun é seo a chuir i bhfeidhm le tacaíocht an Aire?Mhol Coimisiún na Gaeltachta gur cheart dúinn tuaraiscí, ar nós an tuairisc a d'fhoilsigh an Dr. Harris maidir le caighdeán na Gaeilge sa chóras bunoideachais, a chuir ar fáil.  Is cúis imní dúinn iad na conclúidí a bhain an Dr. Harris amach maidir leis an íslú tubaisteach atá tagtha ar theagasc agus caighdeán na Gaeilge i measc na ndaltaí sna gnáth-bhunscoileanna — níl mé ag caint faoi na gaelscoileanna.  Ní theastaíonn uainn go mbeadh Gaeilge sna gaelscoileanna agus gan Gaeilge ar bith sna scoileanna eile.  Caithfimid díriú isteach ar an cheist mór sin.  B'fhéidir go gcaithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi oiliúnt múinteoirí.  B'fhéidir gur chóir go mbeadh coláiste speisialta ann chun múinteoirí a oiliúnt trí Ghaeilge.  Bheadh éileamh ar na múinteoirí sin sna gaelscoileanna agus sna Ghaeltacht chomh maith.  Deirtear liomsa go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra ag gaelscoileanna agus scoileanna Gaeltachta múinteoirí a fháil a bhfuil an caighdeán oiriúnach acu chun múineadh i gaelscoileanna nó scoileanna Gaeltachta.Ba mhaith liom labhairt mar gheall ar an staidéar teangeolaíoch ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, ar a dhein an Aire lainseáil coicís ó shin ag Oireachtas na Gaeilge.  D'eascair sé sin ó Choimisiún na Gaeltachta.  Tháinig na saineolaithe le chéile chun obair iontach a dhéanamh.  Cé go bhfuil an tuairisc ar fáil, ní fhaca mé ach achoimre de go fóill.  Sílim go bhfuil nach mór 600 leathanach sa tuairisc ar fad — d'fhéadfá a rá go bhfuil sé chomh mór leis an Encyclopaedia Britannica.  Tá achoimre de 60 nó 70 leathanach déanta air.  Mar duine a rugadh sa Ghaeltacht — tá an chuid is mó de mo shaol caite sa Ghaeltacht agam — caithfidh mé a rá go ndearbhaíonn tuairimí agus conclúidí an tuaraisc sin na rudaí a fheicimid ag tarlú sna ceantair Gaeltachta.  Is millteanach agus uafásach an scéal é nach í an Ghaeilge teanga baile beagnach 50% de na daltaí a théann ar scoil don chéad uair sna ceantair is láidre Gaeltachta.  Is ceist iontach é sin.  Níl freagra na ceiste sin agam.  B'fhéidir gur féidir linn naíscoileanna a chur ar fáil ar fud na nGaeltachtaí, ionas go mbeidh deis ag daltaí an Ghaeilge an fhoglaim sa naíonra sula dtéann siad go dtí an bhunscoil.  B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn dhá chineál scoileanna a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht — scoileanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar an teanga teagaisc agus labhartha, agus scoileanna eile dos na tuismitheoirí atá ag iarraidh a gcuid páistí a theagasc trí Béarla.Ar ndóigh, tháinig an cheist sin chun cinn go mór le cúpla seachtain anuas i gCorca Dhuibhne.  Tá conspóid mór sa Daingean mar go bhfuil cuid de na tuismitheoirí ann ag iarraidh a gcuid páistí a theagasc trí Bhéarla agus tá cuid eile acu sásta leis an Ghaeilge.  Ní shílim go bhfuil sé sin réitithe go fóill.  Cé gurb é an Béarla an teanga fá choinne an chuid is mó de na hábhair a theagasc i Gairmscoil Mhic Diarmada ar Árainn Mhór i mo dháilcheantair fhéin, tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil malairt tuairime ag teacht ar muintir na háite anois.  Tá pobailbhreith le chur ar siúl ar an oileán, i measc tuismitheoirí an lá inniu agus an lá amárach, chun a fháil amach cé acu teanga ab fhearr leo.  Fanfaimid go dtí go gheobhaimid amach cinneadh na hoileánaigh.Tá an-chuid moltaí sa staidéar teangeolaíoch.  Cé go raibh an choimisiún ag déanamh taighde le cúig bliana anuas, bhí orainn fanacht beagnach bliain go dtí gur gcuireadh an tuairisc ar fáil.  Bhí an Aire agus an Roinn ag suí ar an staidéar le bliain anuas, ach tá sé curtha ar fáil anois.  Tá an dealramh ar go bhfuil fochoiste den chomhaireacht chun breathnú air ar feadh bliain nó dhó eile.  Dúirt an Aire nach mbeidh ann ach bliain — féachfaimid más mar sin é.  De réir an tuairisc, muna ndéantar rud éigin taobh istigh de achar ghearr — caithfimid na moltaí a chur i bhfeidhm, mar shampla — b'fhéidir go mbeidh na ceantair is láidre Ghaeilge i láthair na huaire ar an chaighdeán chéanna leis na ceantair is laige taobh istigh de 20 bliain.  Tá sé cinnte go bhfuil brú uafásach ar an Ghaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Tá na staitisticí ann.  Chuir an choimisiún an obair agus an saothar isteach ann.  Ní féidir linn é a bhréagnú.Is féidir leis an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oifigiúla na tíre seo, is féidir linn Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bheith againn agus is féidir linn an Ghaeilge a dhearbhú mar theanga oifigiúla ag leibhéal na hEorpa, ach muna féidir linn dul i bhfeidhm leis na ghnáthdaoine atá ina gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí agus an taoide seo a stopadh agus a chasadh ar ais, is cinnte go mbeidh muid i bponc.  Is glaoch géibhinne, nó distress call, í an tuairisc seo.  Caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh go práinneach.  Tá straitéis náisiúnta againn maidir leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn go náisiúnta.  Tá moltaí an staidéar teangeolaíoch againn chomh maith.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach an bhfuilimid ag dul i mbun comhoibriú.  An bhfuil na grúpaí éagsúla chun teacht le chéile?  An mbeidh siad ag teacht salach ar a chéile?Ag deireadh na scéala, sílim go bhfuil an tuairisc faoin Ghaeltacht chun ualach uafásach a chuir ar an chóras oideachais.  Ní shílim go bhfuil na hachmhainní ag an chóras sin chun an scéal seo a réiteach.  Tá múinteoirí oilte ag obair i scoileanna Gaeltachta ina bhfuil an Bhéarla mar teanga teaglaigh ag leath na ndaltaí.  Mar nach bhfuil ábhair agus áiseanna eile ar fáil, caithfaimid díriú isteach agus rud éigin a dhéanamh ar son chúrsaí oideachais.  Is iar-mhúinteoir mé féin.  Nuair a bhí mé ag caint le múinteoirí aréir, dúirt siad liom gurb í an dátheangachas an deacracht is mó atá acu sna scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Tá na teaghlaigh beagnach dátheangach de thairbhe.  Caithfimid dul i bhfeidhm ar na teaghlaigh.  Is é ceann de moltaí an staidéar teangeolaíoch ná gur cheart dúinn deontais a thabhairt do theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl mé ag caint faoi scéim labhartha na Ghaeilge.  Áitítear gur cheart deontas fiúntach de €5,000 a chuir ar fáil chun a dhéanamh cinnte gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga teaghlaigh.  Is moladh úr agus réabhlóideach é sin.  Bhí comhartha ceiste agam i gcónaí mar gheall ar daoine a íoc as teanga a labhairt.  B'fhéidir go gcaithfimid smaoineamh ar a leithéad de phlean.  Tá sé molta go ndéanfaí cigireacht ar an scéim.  Cén dearcadh ata ag an Aire faoi sin?Tuigim ó tuairiscí a tháinig amach seachtain ó shin go bhfuil an t-Aire sásta €3,000 sa bhliain a thabhairt d'fheirmeoirí a ligeann do dhaoine siúl ar a gcuid talamh.

Má chaillfimid an Ghaeilge ansin beimid ag briseadh an nasc atá ann leis na mílte bliain, is cuma cad a dtarlaíonn sa chuid eile den tír.  Tá an dualgas sin orainn uilig.  Níl mé ag cur dualgais ar an Aire féin.  B'fhéidir gur chóir go dtiocfadh coiste il-ghabhálach den Dáil le chéile mar is ceist náisiúnta í seo don teanga agus do chultúr na tíre, agus caithfimid uilig dul taobh thiar de chibé moltaí nó straitéis atá i gceist.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Tá áthas orm labhairt sa díospóireacht seo.  Le déanaí thug mé Aire na Méara Fada, Minister of the Long Finger, ar an Aire.  Deirim é sin arís.  Inniu, tá mé chun labhairt as Gaeilge agus as Béarla.  For the purpose of today's debate, I intend to address the House in both Irish and English.  We are discussing two documents, the statement on the Irish language issued by the Government in December 2006 and the 2002 Coimisiún na Gaeltachta report.The main decision in regard to the 2006 Government statement was to prepare a 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  Last week, I put a parliamentary question to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in regard to the progress on implementing the recommendations of the statement.  I also asked how many meetings had taken place of the executive committee.  The Minister informed me that the principal decision was to develop a 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  He went on to say he held a meeting, Fóram na Gaeilge, on 5 March 2007.  This forum was in existence throughout the life of the last Dáil and was charged with developing this strategy.  It was agreed to form a sub-committee that would operate as a connection between the forum and his Department from the point of view of preparing the strategy.  This sub-committee met in May and, among other the matters, discussed the employment of a consultant to assist the Minister's Department in preparing the strategy.  I was informed that the Department had been discussing the process since then with a number of proposals having been made in regard to employment of the consultant.  In the reply which issued on 31 October, the Minister informed me that the sub-committee would meet on Friday, 2 November.  That is remarkable progress.The Minister stated it was proposed to consult the public as part of the process of preparing the strategy and a series of public meetings would be held in various parts of the country.  That is certainly an improvement on how the Minister acted while the Official Languages Act 2003 was passing through the Dáil.  He informed a private meeting with the Irish language organisations in Spidéal that it was as well that English speaking people did not know about the Act because it would be difficult to pass if they did.  At least he is going to allow open debate on this occasion.He also stated that the process for developing the strategy would take approximately two years.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	169	That is typical of this Minister.  It is clear that he does not have the support of his Government colleagues on the initiatives he wishes to take on behalf of the Irish language.  Today, we are discussing the Coimisiún na Gaeltachta report and not specifically the comprehensive linguistic study of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  No hard copy of that is available and I understand that it is difficult to retrieve the document from the Department's website.  The Coimisiún na Gaeltachta report was published in May 2002.A study of Gaeltacht schools was published by An Comhairle Um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta in May 2005.  An Comhairle was established 2002 under the provisions of section 31 of the Education Act 1998.  The study finds that the future of the Gaeltacht is intertwined with the future of the education system in the Gaeltacht.  Therefore, if there is no resolution to the present crisis in the education system, the future of the Gaeltacht is at risk.  The findings in this report are in line with the findings of the recent study, so I am not sure what we were waiting for in terms of addressing the situation.The Minister's press release on the launch of the linguistic study on the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht states that, while noting the report, the Government did not necessarily accept its recommendations.  The Minister added that a Cabinet level committee is being established to consider matters arising in the context of the reports and their analyses and recommendations with a view to agreeing an integrated action plan within 12 months to secure the future of Irish as the community language in the Gaeltacht.  I understand the Minister has indicated that all Ministers are entitled to take part in this committee.  It will be interesting to see how many take part.  In order to flush out what is really happening in regard to the Irish language in this Government, quarterly reports on the committee should be made to the Oireachtas regarding the progress it made and the Ministers who attended it.I am sick and tired of studies, committees and fora being established when little or nothing is happening in regard to the crisis facing the Gaeltacht and the Irish language generally.  This Minister is overly dependent on legislation as the way to revive the language and strengthen its development.  Radical thinking is needed for Irish.  If the language is to have any chance, the various State functions in regard to it should be co-ordinated through the Taoiseach's office.  There should be a full audit of the amount of money spent by the State in various ways on the Irish language, which could easily be of the order of €1 billion.

By that calculation, if €1 billion is spent on Irish, €51 billion is spent on English.  That was exactly the point made in 1950 in regard to the need to spend money on the Irish language.

If they are not being achieved, we must move quickly to make the adjustments necessary.  However, in the absence of a proper strategy on the Irish language, there is no overall policy position to which all other elements of action regarding the Irish language can relate.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	192	An bhfuil?  Tá go maith.  What is happening with regard to seachtain na Gaeilge?A special Oireachtas committee dealing with the Irish language solely, in all its ramifications, should be set up.  Furthermore, a high level committee should be formed between the Department of Education and Science, RTE, TG4 and Radió na Gaeltachta to maximise the resources available for promoting the Irish language and explaining to people the cultural gem that is the Irish language, the fact that it is now in danger and what exactly we would lose should we lose our language.  We must convey the message that engaging with the Irish language can bring joy and can enrich us.  This is not something that will come from compulsion and legislation.Recent reports into what it costs to produce some documents in Irish, which are neither bought nor read by anyone, indicate strongly the need to review the operations of the Official Languages Act and to have the political courage to make the appropriate amendments to that Act.Tá sé tábhachtach go gcothaítear cumas leanaí an Ghaeilge a labhairt chomh luath agus is féidir, ábhar a bhfuil mé ag plé leis le fada.  Ba cheart gramadach na Gaeilge a shimpliú agus na briathra neamhrialta a chur ar leataobh go bhféadfadh páistí dul i ngleic leis an Ghaeilge agus an seans acu í a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt níos luaithe.Ina theannta sin, caithfear fáil réidh den tuiseal ginideach, ní fiú leanúint leis a thuilleadh ó thaobh leanaí a mhealladh don teanga, agus daoine fásta gan cumas labhartha na Gaeilge fosta.  Dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge níos fusa dóibhsean, chuirfidís chuige níos tapúla ná mar atá.Ba cheart don Roinn, nó cibé Roinn is cuí, féachaint ar cad is féidir a dhéanamh.  Tá focail eile ag teacht isteach sa Ghaeilge anois, ach tá siad "artificiálta", chun focal den tsort a úsáid.  Is ceart rudaí praiticiúla a dhéanamh, sin an fáth go molaim go gcuirfidh an tAire coiste ard-leibhéal ar bun idir An Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta chun gur féidir an fheidhm is fearr a bhaint as na háiseanna sin chun an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus a chur os comhair na ndaoine cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá an teanga.Céard atá i gceist?  Tá logainmneacha ann ar fud na tíre ar fad, ní féidir éalú as sin, mar shampla, Port an Dúnáin sin Portadown.  Tá a lán staire ag baint leis na logainmneacha.  Má thuigeann leanaí foinse na logainmneacha sa cheantar, bíonn suim acu sa stair.  Is as Contae Phort Láirge mé féin, the harbour that is shaped like a thigh, agus má fhéachann duine ar an léarscáil, feicfidh sé cén fáth go bhfuil an logainm sin ann.  Focail ar nós dún, trá, cill, mór agus beag, tá siad uilig ann.Impím ar an Aire rud éigean a dhéanamh.  Tá na coiste agus tuarascálacha uilig againn ach cur chuige atá uainn.

Níl an tuarascáil léite ina iomlán agam, tá sé beagáinín ró-fhada le léamh i gceann cúig nó sé lá ach tá a lán ann ba chóir dúinn machnamh an-dhian a dhéanamh air.  Is gá dúinn gníomhú go práinneach uirthi.Tá sé leagtha amach go soiléir sa chuid atá léite agam go dtí seo go bhfuil cruachás ann ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de agus todhchaí na Gaeilge sna ceantair sin.  Tá údair na tuairisce ag brath orainn agus tá dúshlán tugtha dúinn gníomhú go práinneach dá réir mar tá cruachás ann agus caithfimid gníomhú tapaidh a dhéanamh.  Tá sé luaite sa tuarascáil go bhfuil tréimhse de deich nó 15 bliana againn chun roinnt den chreimeadh agus den mheath atá ag teacht ar phobal labhartha na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a athrú go bhfásfaidh an líon Gaeilgeoirí a úsáideann an Ghaeilge chuile lá sa Ghaeltacht.Is trua liom an sórt cacamais a chuala mé ón Teachta romham faoin Ghaeilge agus faoi chaiteachas uirthi.  Is trua go dtarlaíonn sin go leanúnach, ní amháin anseo ach lasmuigh fosta.  Aon airgead a chaitear ar an Ghaeilge, is ar son leasa na Gaeilge é.  B'fhéidir gur féidir é a chaitheamh níos fearr beagáinín ach sa deireadh is cóir dúinn i bhfad níos mó a chaitheamh ar shlánú na Gaeilge i gceart.Is trua go bhfuil muid fós ag an staid a bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laige ann in ainneoin polasaí an Stáit ó thús an Ghaeilge a athbheochan agus sochaí dátheangach a bhunú, nó ar a laghad go mbeadh stádas ag an Ghaeilge.  Theip ar an Stát agus is féidir seo a léiriú trí staid na Gaeltachta a mheas.  Tá cinnte iontacha déanta maidir leis an Ghaeilge thar na blianta, ach níor cuireadh na hacmhainní cuí leis na chinnte sin.  Freisin, níor dhéileáil éinne riamh leis an naimhdeas a tháinig ón Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta le tamall de bhlianta maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Sin ceann de na príomh fáthanna go bhfuil meath ag tarlú.  Chomh maith le sin, níl muid tar éis díriú isteach ar an dúshlán mór, is é sin, conas is féidir linn an meon sin a athrú.  Conas is féidir linn cur ina luí ar an Roinn go bhfuil air, ní amháin déileáil leis an éileamh maidir le gaelscolaíocht, ach é a chothú?  Ba chóir don Roinn déileáil le ceisteanna maidir le tumoideachas blianta ó shin.  Is dóigh liom go ndearna an Aire cinneadh mícheart le déanaí.  Ba chóir go gcuirfeadh sí ar leataobh an cinneadh sin agus go mbeadh tumoideachas á mholadh, ní amháin sna scoileanna Gaeltachta agus breac Gaeltachta, ach i ngach scoil, ionas go mbeidh muid in ann teacht ar ais i gceann 20 bliain agus go mbeidh athrú iomlán tagtha ansin ar an ghéarchéim maidir leis an Ghaeilge sna gaeltachtaí agus timpeall na tíre.Is trua nach mbeidh an oiread sin daoine ag léamh na tuarascála seo mar leagtar amach ann cé chomh thábhachtach agus atá an cheist seo.  D'aithin muid, na daoine atá gafa le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, go raibh an scéal seo le teacht.  Is trua, áfach, go raibh orainn fanacht leis an tuarascáil seo le spreagadh a thabhairt.  Bhí daoine ag rá go leanúnach go raibh meath ag teacht ar an ghaeltacht agus, dá réir sin, ar an thobar sin ó thaobh na teanga agus ár gcultúr de.Caithfimid díriú ar na ceisteanna atá leagtha amach sa tuarascáil maidir le conas is féidir linn déileáil le ceisteanna pleanála sa Ghaeltacht, le ceisteanna maidir le hoideachas agus maidir leo siúd atá sásta a pháistí a thógaint le Gaeilge.  Mar léiriú ar mheon an Stáit maidir leis an teanga in am nach raibh an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta na rialacha a athrú nó a chur ar leataobh ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge, seo scéal.  Is cuimhin liomsa freastal ar scoil Dhún Chaoin nuair a bhí baol ann go ndúnfaí í.  Chuaigh mo chlann, clann Dick Burke, a bhí mar Coimisinéar, agus cúpla clann eile chun na scoile sin gach mí Meitheamh chun na huimhreacha a árdú ann ionas go gcoinneofar ar oscailt í.  Tá an scoil fós beo agus trí nó ceithre mhúinteoir ann.De réir na tuarascála, tá meath ag tarlú, fiú i nDún Chaoin, maidir leis an méad daoine atá ag tógaint páistí trí Ghaeilge, nó an méad daoine atá ag labhairt Gaeilge lasmuigh den chóras oideachais.  Níor éirigh go hiomlán linn mar sin.  Conas is féidir linn an dream a bhfuil cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht, nó atá ag obair nó ag freastal ar scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht, a mhealladh chun casadh go huile agus go hiomlán ar an Ghaeilge?  Cad iad na hacmhainní breise atá de dhíth?  Cén uirlisí breise ar chóir dúinn a lonnadh sna Gaeltachtaí chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go dtarlóidh athrú suntasach faoi cheann deich mbliana nó mar sin, ionas nach rachaidh na Gaeltachtaí i laige arís?Tá athruithe ann le tamall blianta anuas, ach ní dóigh liom go bhfaca muid go fóill toradh iomlán na cinnte a tógadh, mar shampla, an cinneadh maidir le teilifís na Gaeilge.  Measaim go bhfuil tionchar nach beag aige.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tuarascáil i bhfad níos measa murach teilifís nó raidío na gaeltachta.  Arís, bhí ar an phobal raic a thógaint chun cead a bheith acu na stáisiúin seo a chur ar fáil.  Molaim an iar Aire, an Teachta Michael D. Higgins, a thóg an cinneadh teilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil.Tá cinntí eile déanta chomh maith.  Mhol mé an tAire nuair a chuir sé an Bille i dtaobh na teangacha oifigiúla fé bhráid an Oireachtais.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid tairbhe an Achta sin amach anseo, ainneoin go raibh mé ag troid leis an Aire faoi é a dhéanamh níos foirfe agus ag iarraidh go mbeadh forálacha ann a bheadh in ann déileáil leis na ceisteanna atá tar éis teacht chun cinn sa tuarascáil seo.Tá dúshlán mór romhainn Gaeilgeoirí díograsacha agus gníomhacha a lonnadh sna Gaeltachtaí arís, ionas go mbeidh daonáireamh iontu a léireoidh go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt agus níos mó Gaeilgeoirí ag freastal ar scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Ceann de na fadhbanna atá luaite sa tuarascáil ná go bhfuil méad na Béarlóirí atá ag freastal ar scoileanna Gaeltachta ag dul i méid.  Is gá acmhainní agus am an chóras oideachais a chaitheamh ar na daoine seo a Ghaelú.  Ba chóir freisin breis maoiniú a thabhairt do na scoileanna Gaeltachta chun cinntiú nach gcuirfidh an líon daltaí le Béarla as an ghnáth obair scoile mar go gcaithfidh an múinteoir níos mó ama a chaitheamh ag múineadh Gaeilge dóibh.Caithfear, freisin, breis acmhainne a chur ar fáil do thuismitheoirí nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar a thoil acu atá ag bogadh isteach i gceantair gaeltachta ó cheantair eile.  Is cóir go mbeadh tumoideachas ar fáil do thuismitheoirí nó aon duine eile, is cuma an bhfuil páistí acu nó nach bhfuil nó más daoine ar phinsean iad, a bhogann isteach sna cheantair seo.  Is cóir go mbeadh sin mar chuid de na coinníollacha pleanála.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an córas pleanála ag déileáil leis na ceiste seo i dtaobh daoine atá ag iarraidh cur futhu sa Ghaeltacht.  Is gá athrú suntasach a dhéanamh maidir leis an cheist pleanála agus is cóir coinníollacha teanga a chur i bhfeidhm maidir leo siúd atá ag iarraidh cur fúthu sa Ghaeltacht.  Sa deireadh thiar, is rud ársa atá againn sna Gaeltachtaí.  Má leanann muid ar aghaidh ag ligint do theaghlaigh Béarla bogadh isteach sna ceantair sin, is léir go leanfaidh leis an damáiste atá déanta cheana, mar atá léirithe sa tuarascáil.  Tarlóidh an rud céanna má ligeann muid do chomhlachtaí a oibríonn go huile agus go hiomlan trí Bhéarla lonnú sa Ghaeltacht.Má táimíd dáiríre faoi chothú na Gaeilge, caithfidh muid oibriú agus gníomhú de réir na ceisteanna móra atá leagtha amach sa tuarascáil seo.  Sin an cheist: an bhfuil muidne sa Teach seo dáiríre faoi?  Más gá, caithfimid breis maoiniú a dhéanamh.  Ní féidir leis an Aire thall é sin a dhéanamh, ach is féidir leis an Rialtas agus an Aire Airgeadais é a dhéanamh.  Caithfimid léiriú de na céimeanna a bhfuil an Rialtas sásta a thógaint chun tobar na Ghailge a athlíonadh a fheiscint sa chéad buiséad eile agus sna buiséid ina dhiadh sin.  Conas gur féidir linn cuir leis an Ghaeltacht amach anseo?  An chéad rud atá le déanamh againn ná déanamh cinnte nach dtiocfaidh meath níos mó ar an Ghaeltacht.Ceist mór is ea ceist an chóras oideachais.  Measaim gur chóir duinn díriú isteach ar na ceisteanna eile atá luaite sa tuairisc.  Cad iad na impleachtaí a bhaineann le grádú na Gaeltachtaí — na trí grád atá leagtha amach?  Is ceist mór é sin.  Aontaím leis an Aire gur chóir dúinn ár am a thógaint maidir le sin.  Ní féidir linn am a ghlacadh go deo, ach is féidir linn suim mór airgid a infheistiú sa chóras oideachais, nó tumoideachas do tuismitheoirí, láithreach.  Measaim gur chóir go dtiocfadh an Aire ar ais le moltaí den shórt sin.  Ba cheart dúinn léiriú don domhain go bhfuilimid sásta ár ghnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Is maith an rud é go raibh an Aire in ann am a fháil chomh tapaidh chun déileáil leis an tuairisc seo.  Bhí sé beagáinín ró-thapaidh, i slí amháin, mar nach raibh an tuairisc faighte againn luath go leor.

Tá súil agam go bhfuil an Aire agus na hurlabhraí sásta cuidiú liom an suí sin a eagrú mar chuid de Seachtain na Gaeilge 2008.  Ba cheart dúinn sampla a thabhairt gur féidir linn ár gnó a dhéanamh go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge don chuid eile den am.  B'fhéidir go n-úsáidfear níos mó Ghaeilge sa Teach as sin amach agus go mbeimid in ann gníomhú de réir an tuairisc seo.  Éiríonn a lán eile ón dtuairisc sin, ar nós ceisteanna oideachais.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Ba mhaith liom labhairt go háirithe mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht i mo dháilcheantar fhéin.  Measaim go bhfuil an Ghaeilge láidir go leor sa Mhí Thoir.  Tá ceantar Gaeltachta againn i mBaile Ghib.  Nuair a bhreathnaímid ar an dtuarascáil, is léir gur Ghaeltacht sa ghrád C is ea Baile Ghib — tá an dealramh ar an scéal gur Ghaeltacht lag atá i gceist.  Tá sé sin fíor go pointe áirithe.  Nuair a bhí mé ag canbhasáil san áit sin — fuair mé an-tacaíocht ó muintir na Gaeltachta — d'fhoglaim go bhfuil a lán Ghaeilge á labhairt sna tithe agus sna scoileanna, go háirithe — i gcúrsaí oideachais, mar shampla.  Tá nascanna sóisialta láidre i Gaeltacht na Mí.  Bíonn oícheanta Ghaeilge acu.  Nuair a bhí mé ag léamh an nuachtán áitiúil an tseachtain seo caite, dúirt an ceannlíne go bhfuil amhras mór faoi Ghaeltacht Bhaile Ghib.  Tar éis dom an tuairisc a léamh, measaim nach bhfuil aon amhras faoi stádas na gaeltachta ar chor ar bith.  Má tá an pobal áitiúil ar iarraidh an stádas sin a choinneáil agus an Ghaeilge a labhairt, ní bheidh aon fadhb acu.  Tabharfaidh mé gach uile tacaíocht dóibh.  Aontaím leis an Teachta McGinley go gcaithfidh gach pháirtí obair le chéile ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo, a bhaineann le stair agus cultúr na tíre.Níl na moltaí sa tuarascáil a bhaineann le gráid A, B agus C ró-shoiléir.  Deirtear gur chóir dúinn stratéis forbartha eacnamaíochta a chuir ar fáil dos na Gaeltachtaí.  Dá mbeadh straitéis ghearr-théarmach ann le haghaidh eacnamaíocht Bhaile Ghib, measaim go dtiocfadh a lán fiontar as.  Is í an fhadhb is mó i mBaile Ghib ná go bhfuil na tithe go léir scaipthe go fairsing — tá an séipéil in áit amháin agus tá an siopa in áit eile.  Tagann daoine le chéile sa scoil.  Measaim nach mbíonn an aifreann trí Ghaeilge gach Domhnach.  Tá a lán fadhbanna pleanála san áit freisin.  Tháinig daoine go dtí mo chlinic cúpla seachtain ó shin chun caint liom mar gheall ar an dtalamh atá zónáilte i mBaile Ghib.  Tá sé scríobhta go dearfa i phlean forbartha na chontae go bhfuil cuid den dúiche zónáilte.  Tarlaíonn sé go minic nach mbíonn an talamh úd le díol, áfach.  Ní féidir é a cheannach.  Tá bac á chuir ar daoine le Gaeilge nach bhfuil ón cheantair atá ag iarraidh bogadh isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus páirt a ghlacadh i pobal na háite.  Tá sé molta go mbeadh Baile Átha Buí mar baile seirbhíse Gaeltachta.  Measaim go mbeadh Cheannanas Mór níos fearr mar baile seirbhíse Gaeltachta mar go bhfuil sé idir an dá Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh Baile Átha Buí an-oiriúnach do Rath Chairn — tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i bhfad níos láidre i Rath Chairn ná mar atá i mBaile Ghib.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach go bhfuil oifig an chomhairle chontae agus rudaí eile i gCeannanas Mór.Iarradh orm inné litir a scríobh chuig an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta mar gheall ar choláiste dara-leibhéal lán-Ghaeilge atá á phleanáil i gContae na Mí, gar le Droichead Átha.  Tá an-éileamh ann do scoil den shórt sin.  Bhí baint agam le gaelscoil a bhunaíodh i mí Meán Fómhair seo caite.  Bhí an iomarca daoine ag iarraidh a gcuid páistí a chlárú sa scoil sin.  Measaim go bhfuil todhchaí na Ghaeilge geal go maith taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta McGinley, tá na gaelscoileanna ag déanamh an-iarracht agus tá dea-tairbhe le feiceáil de bharr sin.  Caithfimid leanúint ar aghaidh le sin taobh amuigh den ghaeltacht.  Má tá oideachas dara-leibhéal ar fáil i gaelcholáiste d'iad siúd atá á lorg, cuireann sé sin go mór leis an Ghaeilge.  Tabharfaidh mé an-tacaíocht don meánscoil nua lán-Ghaeilge taobh amuigh de Droichead Átha.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an tuarascáil seo.  Má tá an pobal ag iarraidh go mairfidh na Gaeltachtaí, mairfidh siad le cabhair ó gach éinne agus ón Stáit.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Go raibh míle maith agat.  I am delighted to speak today on the Government statement on the Irish language and on the Irish language in general.  I am not afraid to admit I do not speak Irish but I make an effort to speak Irish and have a strong interest in the Gaeltacht.  There are three Gaeltacht areas in the constituency I represent and I am delighted to say that, in the recent general election, people in those areas gave me 32% of the vote, which is something of which I am very proud.Before the last general election TG4 carried out a poll, the results of which were amazing.  People who spoke Irish in the Gaeltacht were asked which of the five Deputies in Mayo best represented the Gaeltacht and I was delighted when they answered that I was the person who best represented them and that I spoke a language they understood, even if it was not Irish.  Fine Gael has always supported the Irish language and will continue to do so.Fine Gael founded this State and set up the Department of the Gaeltacht.  My own county provided one of the finest Ministers for the Gaeltacht, P. J. Lindsay.  He is still talked of in the Gaeltacht, although I only knew him for a very short time.  He was only in the job for a short time and people say it is a pity he was not there for longer because we would probably have a stronger Gaeltacht now.  He was not afraid to use his ministerial power to do what had to be done.  At that time Fine Gael talked about the revival of the language but that was a long time ago.  It has been 75 years since the foundation of the State and hypocrisy about the Irish language persists.  I hope I do not offend anybody in what I say.  The first meeting took place yesterday of the Joint Committee on Arts, Tourism, Sport, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  There are 24 committees of the Oireachtas, 24 chairmen and 24 vice-chairmen but not one committee exclusively for the Gaeltacht.  It is a disgrace that the Houses of the Oireachtas do not have a committee dealing exclusively with the Gaeltacht.  I propose that the Minister talk to the Taoiseach about setting up a 25th committee to deal with the Gaeltacht.I note that a further ministerial committee is being proposed by the Government.  This means the end of the report which was published last week.  The Minister may do his best but the Cabinet sub-committees will have no interest in the Irish language because there has been no interest for the past 75 years.I went through the educational system and I learned catechism and mathematics and everything, including writing, through Irish.  Yet I left school without being able to speak a word of Irish.  Why is it still the case that 95% of people who have completed their schooling are not able to speak a word of Irish?  This is a sign there is something wrong with the way they were taught.  Why has there been an upsurge in gaelscoileanna all over the country?  It is because people want their children to learn Irish but they are of the view that the national schools are not able to do so.  If that is the case there is something wrong with the educational system.The Minister has responsibility for the Irish language.  The Minister for Education and Science is trying to interfere with the gaelscoileanna.  She wanted the gaelscoileanna to use Irish but now she wants the gaelscoileanna to teach English.  As somebody who does not speak Irish, this does not make sense to me.  I suggest the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, take the Minister for Education and Science aside and ask her why, if the gaelscoileanna are working, they should now have to spend ten or 20 minutes a day teaching English.  This does not make sense and something must be done.There has been too much hypocrisy associated with the Irish language for too long.  I would love to be able to speak Irish and I am sure everybody in this House would love to be able to speak Irish.  There are two reasons I cannot speak Irish.  The education system is not right.  The Minister and Deputy McGinley are two excellent Irish speakers.  I meet Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht on a daily basis who talk to me in English as I do not have Irish but other people who are Irish speakers but not from the Gaeltacht will put up their noses at those of us who cannot speak Irish.  They put up their noses again when we try to speak a few words of Irish because they think they are better than everybody else because they can speak the Irish language.If we want to teach the Irish language, we must ensure that people enjoy learning the language.  I always remember being abused by a Christian Brother — I use the word "abused" — when I could not pronounce the word "focal".  I will never forget that word until the day I die.  He beat me and battered me until I said it.  I will not put on the record of the House the word I used, after which he told me to sit down.  I should have used that word sooner and I would not have been black and blue.  My father wanted to go to the school the next day to use a few words in Irish to him but I stopped him.  This is the reason the Irish language is the way it is; the people who taught it in the past.  If they could not teach you, they tried to beat it into young people.  This is the reason the Irish language is in the state it is today.The gaelscoileanna along with the revival of Gaelic music, dance and culture, are doing more for the Irish language.  The Oireachtas festival was held in Westport last week.  I come from Cathair na Mart.  The people of Westport responded to the Oireachtas event last weekend.  It was an excellent exhibition of the Irish language, Irish culture and young people enjoying themselves without having to take over a town.  They came and enjoyed themselves and it was a great weekend.  Everything went well and people enjoyed the sean nós and the dancing and the Irish culture at its best.  I compliment Piarais Ó Raghallaigh and his wife and everybody involved for the hard work.I have never visited Farmleigh but maybe I will have dinner there when I am a Minister or spend a night there.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	199	An event was held in Farmleigh on 21 December 2006 at which the Minister made a statement about the future of the Irish language.  Forum na Gaeilge was an advisory group set up by the Minister.  How many times has the group met?  How many times did it report to the Minister?  When will it meet next?  The Minister was to appoint a civil servant to set up an Irish language strategy.  What work has this person undertaken?  I wish to know the name of the person.  A total of €300,000 was set aside for the Irish language strategy.  How much of this money was spent?  The Minister was to bring in expert advisers to advise him on how to revive the Irish language and how to teach people to speak the language.  What has been happening in this regard?  I would love to see more people being able to speak Irish.I wish to bring an issue to the attention of the Minister which I raised with the Minister for Transport this morning.  I refer to signage in Irish and the spelling of names in Irish in the Gaeltacht.  They cannot even spell the names properly on the signposts.  I ask the Minister to speak to the Minister for Transport and to the local authorities to ensure that incorrect signage is taken down and corrected immediately.  It is difficult enough for foreigners looking for Clonbur who see it written in Irish but not even spelled correctly.  I ask the Minister to deal with this matter immediately.

This is a tricky issue because it is a handbook rather than a regulation.  I agree with the Deputy.  There is no excuse for what is happening.  The local authorities can get the proper, official forms from the placenames branch.  I do not understand how they cannot copy down the official spellings for use on the signs.I do not like to interject because the Deputy is in full flow but he may remember the famous sign over near Cross, for Inishmacatreer, known in Irish as Inis Mhic a' Trír. They managed, in some marvellous achievement, to put a different version of the Irish name on both sides of the same sign.  This is the one that took the biscuit, in my view.  It should be given full marks for total codology.

Certain people had a little go at me about the Irish language.  As I said at the time, I was not as lucky as some of them as I was not born with a golden spoon but I survived without it.  I would love to be able to speak Irish.  Two of my three children are very good Irish speakers.  They got no support or help from me but the reason they are good is because they wanted to learn Irish.  It was taught to them and not beaten into them.It is time the Minister and the Department worked out a better system for teaching Irish in primary schools.  There is no reason a young child starting in first class and leaving in sixth class should not know the Irish language.  It should be like a first language to them.  They would then have no difficulty in continuing their studies of the language.  I am delighted to speak on this motion.  I hope the Minister and his Department and those who love and are interested in the Irish language, and are not talking down to those who cannot speak it, will be provided with resources from the Government.  I hope also that the Minister for Education and Science will support the Minister, the Irish language and the gaelscoileanna because that is the way forward.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Táim an-bhuíoch a bheith ábalta labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo.  Le do thoil, beidh mé ag labhairt as Gaeilge agus as Béarla. I can only speak from my own experience.  Mar Bhaile Atha Cliathach, níl mórán seans agam an teanga a úsáid, or to use it as much I would wish.  However, unlike the previous speaker, I was privileged and lucky to have attended a Christian Brothers' school which was immersed in the Irish culture and Irish language.  I was also lucky in the individuals I met during those years.  Like the Minister, who was immersed in the Irish culture, as a result of meeting those people I spent a number of years i gCill Chiaráin i gContae na Gaillimhe, in the Gaeltacht area.  I am forever grateful for that opportunity.When I left school and went out to work there was not much of a chance for me to practise my Irish.  Despite being in the Civil Service and having the occasional opportunity to use Gaeilge, I found a distinct lack of opportunity to use the language.  However, many of the changes that have taken place in recent times are as a direct result of the Minister's interest in the language and culture and the changes in the public services where people have a choice as whether to correspond or speak to a person as Gaeilge.  There was no such choice a short number of years ago.  That is the change I see.Níl sé ceart nó fíor a rá nach bhfuil suim ag an Rialtas sa teanga nó sa chultúr.  It is just not right to say the Government or the previous Administration do not have an interest in or have at the heart of its policies the future of the Irish language or Irish culture.  The Government has set down the basic principle that the Gaeltacht will be given special support as an Irish speaking area and has demonstrated this commitment not just in words, but by substantial investment.  More than €800 million has been spent on the Gaeltacht and the islands since 1996.  This year we will spend more than €100 million on supporting and nurturing the Irish language.  I see the difference that makes.Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi na gaelscoileanna.  There are a number of gaelscoileanna in my area.  As Deputy Ring said, there is an element of fashion in the way people choose to send their children to gaelscoileanna.  There is also the willingness of my generation to have their children taught through Irish.  That is something we bring with us from our experience of the school system.  I see the link between gaelscoileanna and Gaelic games which is of huge benefit to children and parents.  I have no doubt that whatever needs to be done to support the gaelscoileanna around the country will be done.  Particularly outside the Gaeltacht areas there is an onus on us to ensure people are given the choice and the opportunity to pursue their education trí Gaeilge or through a mixture of Irish and English and whatever subjects they choose as they go through college.  That the gaelscoileanna have become so popular is testament to the way the Irish language has been marketed in recent years.  That is what it is about.  It is about the selling the Irish language and Irish culture.Deputy Ring referred to last weekend and the excellent footage we saw of people, young and old, enjoying themselves and having a good time, all centred around Irish culture and the Irish language.  It is a privilege to see that when it is done properly.  I admire people such as Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the commitment those people have to Irish culture and the way they promote it everywhere they go.  No matter where they are in the world or in the country, they will always promote Irish culture and the Irish language.  We need to promote and support such people as much as possible.I see the difference in children in my own area.  I am particularly aware of their confidence around the gaelscoileanna and their willingness to engage with one as Gaeilge and to become involved in Gaelic sport, football and hurling, and boys and girls mixing and enjoying themselves through a medium which others would find difficult to understand.  That is not the fault of those other people.  It is part of the way we grew up.I have been privileged and lucky to meet people who are totally committed to the language.  I am disappointed that I do not get the opportunity to use it as much as possible.  However, even in public services that is changing.  If I want to have a discussion as Gaeilge or to use a mixture of Irish and English I can do so.  I can telephone somebody and practise what I have managed to retain in the time since I left the educational system.Ba mhaith liom cuple focal a rá faoi TG4 agus comhghairdeas a ghabháil le muintir TG4.  It has done a huge service since its establishment.  This comes through in the young people.  TG4 goes out of its way to appeal to young people and links sports with popular music.  That is something that will pay dividends in the future.  As a nation, we should be proud of the way we have managed to grow that particular institution over the years.Finally, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis on Aire.  As an individual, he has done exceptional work in promoting and ensuring the future of the Irish language.  As a Government and as a party, we on this side of the House have always shown our commitment to the Irish language.  We have always shown our support for the Gaeltacht areas around the country.  We will continue with that support.  Le cuidiú Dé beimid ar ais anseo at some stage in the future continuing to support and congratulate the Minister and I wish him all the best.

Last year, Cork County Council spent €90,000 translating its development plan.  Nobody requested the Irish copy.  In my county, Waterford, €26,000 was spent and not one person requested a copy.  Limerick County Council expects to spend more than €100,000 on the 21 local area plans in addition to the cost of the development plan.  Kilkenny County Council’s two local area plans will cost €7,707.  No requests have been made for a copy there.  It should be noted that the article stated there was a high level of interest in Galway for the copy that Galway County Council has.  That said, it does not come close to excusing the kind of blatant waste that we are witnessing thanks to the provisions of the Official Languages Act.I asked the officials in my own local authority, Dungarvan Town Council, how much they had spent.  They were able to give me the figure for last year's draft development plan, which was approximately €5,000.  I asked the official what he would use the money for.  He did not miss a beat in saying that he would have used it for footpaths for disabled people and for renovating the playground.  I also contacted the director of services who might be dealing with the matter in Waterford County Council.  He confirmed the Irish Examiner figure of €26,000 and also said that not one person had come from the Gaeltacht in Ring to ask for a copy.  He described the provisions as ridiculous.  He went on to make a suggestion.  Even though he believes that the provisions are appalling he said it would be better if the council were allowed to simply translate these items and put them on a website as opposed to printing.  Approximately half the cost——

I still maintain that the Department had no clue as to how much it would cost when the Bill was drafted.  It will cost tens of millions.  I said that at the time and that is what it will run to.  Local authority officials are public officials and we read in the newspaper that public officials effectively admit they are wasting money.  Instead of preventing waste, Department spokespeople are saying that that amounts to a public service.  Effectively they are saying that wasting money is a public service.  What we are dealing with is a public disservice.  It is interesting to note that the newspaper article to which I alluded mentioned that costs are set to rise substantially in coming years as most county development plans and the local area plans are up for renewal.This debate occurred in the North of Ireland recently.  The Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety stopped issuing advertisements and other documents in Irish and Ulster Scots.  He said that the cost over five years had been €216,000 and that a translation service would still be made available on request.  Here is the interesting bit.  He told a colleague in the Northern Ireland Assembly that the savings realised would be returned to the health and social services budget.  "Obviously in an area like health and social services every penny is precious because health and social services is dealing with every single man, woman and child in Northern Ireland and their health and their well being."  I was reminded of what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said in the House yesterday, apologising for what happened in the health services.  If I made the practical suggestion that the money we are wasting in this area could be put into the health services I know I would be met with derision by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív.  That is where the money should go.  We are wasting money and we should put it into an area where it is needed.  They identified the issue in the North and they did it.  God help us, I know there is not a snowball's chance in hell of that ever happening here.Hundreds of thousands of euro have already been and, ultimately, tens of millions of euro will be stripped from local authority and Department budgets in order to satisfy the Minister's own personal whims when it comes to the Irish language.  I know this because every Irish speaker with whom I have ever discussed the matter believes it is a joke.

Tá mé ag freastal ar ranganna faoi láthair chun feabhas a chur ar mo chuid Ghaeilge mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sin tábhachtach.  Le cúnamh Dé, tá súil agam go mbeidh mé in ann díospóireacht iomlán a phlé trí mheán na Gaeilge i gceann cúpla míosa.  The Irish language is a beautiful rich language.  Obviously on 1 January it became an official working language of the EU, which I welcome.  It has been reported in the media that there is a shortage of translators and more students need to be encouraged to study Irish at third level.The Irish language is in crisis.  As Deputy Deasy said, fewer people speak the language now than in 2002.  Shocking statistics emerged from the report published last week.  The study states the Irish language will no longer be the main spoken language in Gaeltacht areas in 15 to 20 years time.  The Government needs to act immediately on the recommendations in the language study.  The Minister has previously stated he would not examine the recommendations for another year but the language cannot wait.  It must be protected and promoted nationwide.  Gaeltachts are essential to the future of the Irish language and they must be protected.  A radically different approach to the language is needed in both our education system and in society.  Above all, we need a Government that will produce a national strategy for the Irish language to ensure its future existence, which will make a clear and honest assessment of where we stand and what the Government wants to achieve for the language.  Sadly, no strategy exists.The Minister has established a language advisory committee but it has no role nor has it the power to issue a report or recommendations.  Instead, it will report to him on whether he should develop a strategy.  How can the language survive or thrive if it has no long-term direction?  A national strategy would ensure all bodies and initiatives promoting the language have a clearly defined role and a clear sense of purpose.  Fine Gael proposes a strategy that will set out the recommendations to be implemented by the Government for the development of the language over the next 20 years.  Deputy Kenny was the first person in recent years to highlight the crisis in the Irish language.  He outlined Fine Gael's vision to bring it into the 21st century.  His radical approach to reforming and reviving Irish is built around a simple goal, which is to equip our people, particularly our young people, with a real, useful and communicative knowledge of the language.  The issue is to bring that vision to the next level and specify the policies of how Fine Gael in government would reform and revive Irish.A modern Irish syllabus is needed and I am disappointed the Minister of Education and Science is not present for the debate.  The language needs to be made attractive to schoolgoers.  While I welcome her proposal to increase the percentage of marks allocated for spoken work, I challenge her to visit a school anywhere in Dublin and teach the current leaving certificate syllabus to an ordinary level class.  I guarantee she would meet obstacles, as most modern day students do not want to know anything about 16th century literature.  The syllabus is wrong and completely out of date and this has not helped the promotion of the Irish language.  Currently, the secondary school syllabus is driving students to hate the language.  Discussion is needed on why Irish is failing in the education system and how it can be improved.  Antagonism towards the language also needs to eliminated.A majority of the population does not use Irish on a daily basis, as Deputy Ring outlined and, despite receiving more than 1,500 hours of education in the language, many young people leave school without a reasonable command of it.  The State needs to get the teaching of Irish correct at primary level because if a love of the language is not instilled in pupils at that level, it will not be followed through as they pass through the education system.I  commend the work of Foras na Gaeilge, which has done a great deal to promote the language among the general population.  Given the number of immigrants entering the State, the language should also be promoted in their communities.  What plans has the Minister to ensure immigrants are aware we have a native tongue and that they can learn the language easily?  In government, Fine Gael would increase investment in gaelscoileanna and address the critical shortage of educational publications in Irish.  The Minister should address this.  My constituency, Dublin North East, has three gaelscoileanna — Gaelcholáiste Reachrann, Gaelscoil Colmcille and Pobalscoil Neasáin.  I commend the work of the principals and teachers in these schools in the promotion of the language.There could be a bright future for the language but only if the Government and the Minister have the courage and vision to implement necessary reforms and pursue far-reaching policies.  My party has the courage and vision.  We would like the population to love the Irish language so that it will thrive.  Fianna Fáil has had an opportunity throughout the years to revive the language and the Minister's legacy leaves a lot to be desired.  Hopefully, he will pay heed to the contributions to this debate and will do everything he can to revive the language.  Fine Gael in government would do all it could for the language.  Gabhaim buíochas don Chathaoirleach agus don Aire as bheith ag éisteacht le mo chuid tuairimí inniu.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, as I feel quite strongly about this issue.  I am not alone in that my experience of learning Irish at school was appalling.  It was viewed at the time that the way to teach Irish was to physically beat the language into children.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the teachers of the day because that was the way things were done.  The way Irish has been taught in schools since the foundation of the State has turned more people off than it has encouraged to speak the language.  Unfortunately, that still pertains.  I worked as a career guidance counsellor for 20 years until I was elected to the House and part of my job was to interview students.  I taught in a large school, which catered from almost 1,000 students at one stage.  I interviewed every pupil on a number of occasions during their time in the school and their loathing for the Irish language always stood out.  I do not say that with pride and it was not the fault of teachers.  If the students had a choice, they would have given up Irish.I know a young man who attended Irish college last summer and he had a great time, as everybody does.  The students had fun and bhí siad ag labhairt Gaeilge.  However, I met him recently when he had just finished school for the day.  His attitude to Irish had totally changed.  He said the way Irish is taught in school is awful.  He hates it and wants to give it up and he is not alone.  There is something terribly wrong when that is happening.  I accept the Minister's bona fides because he is genuine about his desire to promote Irish but the Government must turn this around.  Teenagers must experience fun and excitement when learning Irish and they must not be burdened with literature, grammar and so on before they can speak the language but that is not happening.  They are given textbooks in primary and secondary school, which are dire.  The language is being killed by the Government, which is trying to promote it.  It is in the Government's gift to change this but it is not doing so.  The Government is driving the language down children's throats.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Why does the Minister not do something about this?  Why does he not stop the nonsense of promoting appalling elitism in second levels where youngsters are force fed turgid literature before they can speak the language and have fun using it?  Until the Minister does that he is wasting his time and his money.  When he replies to the House shortly will he not undertake to speak to the other Ministers in Government about changing the system before it is too late?  The language is dying.  I see from the Government statement that almost 1.6 million people in the Republic can speak Irish.  That is rubbish.  If one walks down a street in any city in this country, except perhaps Galway, one finds nobody speaking Irish.  They are speaking Chinese, Polish and English, but they are not speaking Irish, apart from the odd one here and there.  The emperor has no clothes in this.  If the Minister believes that 1.6 million people can speak Irish we are all in serious trouble because this is not the case.  It is not my experience.  The first thing that must happen is that next year all those turgid textbooks at secondary and primary levels should be dumped and young people encouraged to speak as Gaeilge and have fun in the classroom.  There should be Irish dancing, céilithe, and this methodology could be introduced bilingually.  There can be cúpla focail as Gaeilge and cúpla focail as Béarla, but they must have fun, and that is not happening.  Students are suffering, they hate the system and that is why it is not working.Everyone points to the success of the gaelscoileanna, and the Minister is right there, because at that level the children are speaking and having fun in Irish and soaking up the language.  As the Minister and any linguist knows, at that level children learn languages naturally, so they grow up with the language and it is second nature to them.  However, if that has not happened and a child is presented at the junior certificate stage with some of today's Irish textbooks and told he or she must know everything they contain, and be able to write essays before they can even speak it, that is a disaster.  I do not know whether the Government intends to keep on fooling itself with this type of press release.  It states that 1.6 million in the Republic speak Irish and 92% of those surveyed maintain that promoting the language is important.This is an important issue.  I have brought youngsters to other countries on school tours.  The first thing they did when they landed, very often, was to speak Irish among themselves, however little they had.  I have another anecdote for the Minister, as well, which I believe he will enjoy.  In a school I am familiar with there is a high percentage of children from Poland.  They are lovely people.  They talk to each other in Polish in the playground.  I met one little boy recently who told me that if they continued to talk in Polish, he and his friends would speak to each other in Irish.  There is an element of that as well, so we have got to change the way Irish is being taught.I shall probably get lambasted by what I call the Irish Taliban for saying this today.  However, I want to focus on the elitism surrounding Irish, the idea, perhaps, that somebody who speaks the language fluently is somehow more Irish than someone who does not.  That is something I want nailed because it is wrong.  It is not my fault that I cannot speak Irish fluently, because I did not  get the opportunity to do so in school.  As I said at the start, when I was at school the way to teach Irish was to physically beat it in.  I recall being held back in primary school one evening until six o'clock to learn the "Hail Holy Queen" as Gaeilge, such was the thinking in the 1960s.  That type of attitude turned a great many people against Irish at that time.  It was linked to the national question, with which, again, I believe there is an issue.  However, that is now changing, and rightly so.We need a modern syllabus in Irish, but it must first focus on the verbal.  That is the main point.  Most people in this country would love to be able to speak Irish.  TG4 has gone a long way in this regard, but it has a great many programmes in English, so I wonder how much it is promoting the Irish language.I come from an area in east Cork, which the Minister might have heard of, Knockadoon and Ballymacoda.  My grandfather was a fluent Irish speaker and that area was a Gaeltacht.  There is one person, extant, from that area of east Cork who is a native Irish speaker.  There were poets and other literati from that area.  However, in one generation the language was lost in that part of the country.  My father told me that when my grandfather was at school Irish language usage was greatly discouraged.  People who left Ireland at that time could not speak English and were at a disadvantage in the United States and elsewhere.  Also, there was a certain shame if somebody could not speak English, but only Irish.  That is to go way back.However, we really need to get our thinking straight in this regard.  Other contributors have raised the placenames issue.  I am sorry to say this, but again, there is something in the psyche as regards the language being driven down one's throat.  The Minister must have a care in that regard because people resist and resent that.  Irish needs to be encouraged, positively, and to get back to the schools, it needs to be fun, linking in with the wider culture of the country in terms of music and dance.  We are so rich in that area.Unless an enormous change is made quickly in the way Irish is approached in schools — and it is not the teachers' fault, they just do what is laid down  — the language will die.  No amount of legislation, name changes for towns etc. will alter that.  If that happens, it will be regrettable.  I shall be interested in the Minister's contribution when he sums up.  It is urgent that this change is made, that he forgets about the textbook approach and gets young people to speak the language before they are forced to deal with turgid grammar, which even the Minister believes is appalling.

Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil an-buíochas le ghlacadh ag na gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre mar gheall ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  ‘Sé mo thuarim, freisin, go bhfuil an ré sin an bealach amach is tábhachtach chun an Gaeilge a chur le fáil go flúirseach.

All of us, particularly Members of the Oireachtas, have a duty if we feel it is necessary for our language to continue and develop to be seen to make an effort.  If we do not, the blame must fairly and squarely lie on us as legislators for failing to promote usage of the language ourselves and not providing improvement mechanisms for Irish within the educational system.  The Minister will be well aware that in the past three or four years thousands of Brazilians have come to County Galway, including to my constituency and that of the Minister.  In the town of Gort they have, through their own initiative, improved their English and, in some cases, developed a command of Irish in the local primary and secondary schools.

I do not know whether there is an association between the two.  Why do we spend eight years at national school and another five or six at second level and leave practically illiterate in Irish?  There is a reason.Fine Gael made a proposal on the Irish language before the election and it was castigated by the Minister and many others, particularly the Minister for Education and Science.  The latter stated we wanted to abandon our commitment to Irish and that we were intent on killing it, but nothing could be further from the truth because our leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, is an absolutely fluent Irish speaker.  Many others are fluent also but are not sufficiently confident or cleachtaithe chun é a labhairt sa Teach seo nó sa Seanad.If resources were channelled into an education system that emphasised the spoken word initially at national school, we would have a completely different attitude to the language.  The intricacies of Irish grammar and the presentation of the written word are difficult, as the Minister will agree.  There is nothing to indicate clearly that all the fora and studies on the Irish language down through the years increased the number of speakers or the quality of the language spoken.Purists in organisations such as Conradh na Gaeilge, because of their absolute scorn for those who are not 100% correct in all their statements in Irish, have done tremendous damage to the effort to expand its use.  Such people are not as prominent as they once were, which I welcome, and their place has been taken by gaelscoileanna.  Members should do whatever they can, not necessarily at Gaeltacht level but at national level, to expand the gaelscoil concept.The Minister is probably well aware of the tragic circumstances whereby the gaelscoil in Ballinasloe was housed in a small shopping arcade and the classes were housed in particular units thereof.  The school survived owing to the absolute determination of the parents, staff and pupils.  Were it not for this determination, it would have ceased to exist.The Minister for Education and Science was in no way concerned to create the ideal conditions in which the pupils could be educated trí Ghaeilge.  The numbers game that operated with regard to pupil-teacher ratios should have been responded to imaginatively to offer an added incentive to those promoting the language.  This did not happen, perhaps because Department staff in the background said the existing allocation could not be increased.  This led to serious difficulties for the school and many other schools.  The school in Loughrea, Gaelscoil Riabhach, survived in a demountable unit.  The authorities believed they were in heaven when they got the unit on a county council site.  It is far removed from the activity in the town, yet it has survived.  In Athenry, there are proposals for a gaelscoil.The Minister should talk to the Minister for Education and Science with a view to supporting these gaelscoileanna.  Gaelscoileanna are budding in so many areas of the country but are being ignored.  They are being established in undesirable conditions but the Department of Education and Science is not concerned.It is totally wrong that lines are drawn on maps to differentiate between Gaeltachtaí and Galltachtaí.  As one enters Galway city on the Tuam road, one sees the sign for the Gaeltacht.  Does the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs accept this is a real Gaeltacht area?  Under what conditions would he say it is right to identify a region as a Gaeltacht?  Residents in Gaeltachtaí can obtain superior grants for housing projects than those outside them, and that is wrong.  The grants are given only because the residents speak Irish and this leads to resentment on the part of those outside the boundary.  It is important the Minister regularises the system.The Minister for Education and Science, in conjunction with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, should be asked to ensure that Irish is taught entirely through the spoken word in the first few years of primary education, be they pupils in a gaelscoil or otherwise.  Deputy Stanton referred to Irish being beaten into pupils but the many good Irish teachers who made a supreme effort to teach Irish down through the years should not be identified as responsible for having turned children off the language.  The reality is that teaching the language is very difficult.How many second level textbooks are available in Irish for subjects other than tíreolas or stair?  There is none available for mathematics, physics, chemistry or other languages.  If we were serious about Irish, we would make such textbooks available.  In the Minister's constituency there used to be a publishing firm that did marvellous work providing books trí Ghaeilge, including textbooks, but we know what happened to it.  If there is a will and a determination to do the practical things that are important for the promotion of the Irish language, it can be done.I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which was faced with the translation of every Act.  Initially, we said that it would be very costly and that nobody would read the translations.  We must look again at this attitude and say that it is important for us to have those particular items.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Fair enough, that is the problem.  When Deputy Kenny, as leader of Fine Gael, made a very solid proposal for Irish in the future, it was ridiculed in the very same fashion noted by the Minister in respect of what Deputy Deasy said in the House.  Initially, I thought it was a bad idea but I am firmly convinced that it is an important move.One balances that against the fact that our Irish language has been recognised as a European language but that the translators have not been available in Europe in the very recent past.  We can throw our hands up to high heaven and say various things.  We are dealing today with statements on the Irish language.  Does it mean that after today, the focus will shift and we will all go on our merry way?  If that is the case, we should look at all the groups that have been established and all the finances and resources that have been made available, supposedly in the promotion of Irish.  How much of this money has been spent efficiently and effectively to the point that it has helped the Irish language to expand and be a vibrant language in this State?When one contacts some Departments and local authority sections, particularly our own county council in County Galway, it is nice that if one so wishes, one can converse and make one's requests and representations trí Gaeilge.  We do not have them in the Breac-Ghaeltacht in east Galway but, at least, we are conscious of the fact.  While we were members of the local authority, the late Pól Ó Foighil, a former Member of the Seanad, insisted that we would have an officer of Irish and a translation facility installed in the council.  It was probably one of the first in the country.  Such initiatives were important even though they may have seemed insignificant or wasteful in some people's eyes.Raidió na Gaeltachta and TG4 have done more to promote the Irish language than anything else.  It is a pleasure to listen to Raidió na Gaeltachta and watch features on TG4.  If there could have been a connection between Raidió na Gaeltachta and TG4 in the classroom, it would have been positive.  This is why it is so essential to put aside all this written homework that is being done.  If Raidió na Gaeltachta and TG4 had a direct input into Irish in the classroom, much of the ongoing effort and endeavour at higher levels would not be necessary and the Irish language would take off through a natural process rather than the forced endeavour that has been the case in the past.  Slowly but surely, I hope that will be teased out and that we will have an Irish language that will be vibrant as a spoken language rather than emphasis being placed on written work.The Minister knows that we went through an educational system where we were taught poetry and prose that has so little significance and is of so little interest to so many people today.  They are turned off by it.  Certainly, it is all important but if we are serious about having a living Irish language that is used by the people, we must change our ways, be imaginative and brave and turn our backs on the people who will literally castigate us, turn it round and misrepresent the interests of so many people out there who could do so much for us.

Deputy Deasy seems to think that I alone managed to convince the entire Oireachtas to pass an Act.  He obviously does not know the constitutional background to it but I will put that aside for the moment.  Perhaps Deputy Deasy will come back into the House.I thought the contribution of Deputy Stanton was to the point.  I have argued for 20 years that there should be two Irish language courses in schools.  For those who do not have a strong background in the Irish language, there would be a course that would basically teach them the language.  Those who spoke Irish at home or who had developed a good grasp of the language would have the choice of a second course involving the study of Irish literature.I could never understand why this is not accepted.  If one checks the records of the House, one can see that I have pointed out again and again that when I was attending secondary school in Dublin, I studied mathematics, applied mathematics and physics — I believe it is called maths physics now.  Quite honestly, if one studied the physics and mathematics courses and was any good at them, it was a snitch to study the maths physics course and get an honour in it.  That was the way it was.Of course, some children have an advantage going to school.  I admit that my children were Irish and English-speaking when they went to school because we spoke Irish all the time at home and they could not miss the English.  It was a great advantage but is one supposed to penalise them in the leaving certificate?I have always felt that the rational way of approaching this in respect of most students is to teach the language as a vernacular.  Those who then want to go on to study the literature, which is fantastic, should be allowed to do so.  I still have a great grá for poems I learned such as An Bonnán Buí, which is a great satire.  Lines such as “’S gur chosúil liom féin é i nós ‘s i ndath” are very clever and subtle, referring to the poet’s name Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna.  However, one must understand the language.  If one has a great knowledge and understanding of the language, it is great fun but if one is struggling, it is painful.Time and again, I have stood up in this House and wondered, for example, at the reality that I see year after year because I am one of many people who open their houses in the summer to students who come to learn Irish.  My wife and I still open our house and the students still come.  We marvel at how they come with so little Irish and how, after two weeks and six days, they go home with so much.  The reality is that they are there just speaking the language and having fun.  As long as the ethos is right in respect of the language, they grasp it very well and very quickly and have great fun.  They have their little dramas, plays and games.  I have argued with the Department of Education and Science that even the Irish colleges still place too much emphasis on a fixed curriculum.  When I ran an Irish college, which I have not done for many years, I found that they often learned more Irish out on the basketball court, football pitch or ceilís than they learned in the formal classes.

It can sometimes even be difficult for Ministers to bring about change.  It is a very useful debate.  I said many times that there is another problem about which we must be honest.  Many Irish teachers and teachers in primary school do not have enough knowledge of the language to teach it.  I do not blame them.  Every time one makes a statement such as that one is accused of blaming them.  I state it as a fact.  If I went into a school and had a conversation in Irish with many teachers they would not be competent to speak the language.What is the problem?  Would it not be better to show cartoons and "Cúla Búla" in the classroom, with the teacher sitting at the top of the class to ensure the kids do not go wild?  There is no better way for a child to learn a language than by watching television.  Children learn advertisements because they see them again and again in Irish and English.  We should be radical and practices that date to the 1920s should be discarded.  I have tried to reform.I am delighted that Deputy Ring has returned to the Chamber.  He will stand with me on the following point.  When I was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I was very irate about two things.  One was that Gaeltacht islands were dealt with through English, the other that the non-Gaeltacht islands were disgracefully treated with regard to provision of physical services.  I determined that no matter where one lived on an island in this country, Gaeltacht or Galltacht, one would be entitled to the same services.  We would provide the same services to those who live on an Irish-speaking island in Irish and to those who live on an English speaking island in English.  The non-Gaeltacht islands would not be discriminated against in terms of services as they had been in the past.  If they were in the Dáil, the people of the English speaking islands would state that I have honoured my bond.  They were sceptical at the beginning.  Those in Clare Island and Inishturk would admit that I have gone out of my way to ensure the discrepancies and neglect of the past has been made up.  Those in Inishbofin, in my constituency, have seen major investment because I could see no justification, fair or foul, for not granting equal status in terms of basic services we desire.When we refer to figures spent on the Irish language, I will be told we spend €100 million because that is the figure for the budget for the Gaeltacht, islands and the Irish language.  However, we do not spend that figure on the Irish language in the Gaeltacht because most of the services provided through my Department to people in the Gaeltacht are services to which they are entitled.  They are entitled to roads, houses, water and piers, irrespective of the language they speak.  The fact that we channel the money through agencies that deal with the people in the language of the community does not mean it is money spent on the Irish language.  It is money spent on the community.I recently analysed the amount spent on the promotion of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  The figure is €17 million per year.  One can compare that to the amount spent by the Arts Council, some €80 million.  I am in favour of the arts and a country that does not spend money on the arts is not a civilised state.  The amount we spend on the arts is four times what is spent on the promotion of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  That leads us to a point made in an interesting book from 1950.  The point was made that Latin and old Greek had not died but had transmogrified into modern Italian, Spanish and other Romance languages.  It lives on in new form because all languages change over time.  This island and Scotland are the sole repositories in the world of the Gaelic language.  If it dies as a spoken vernacular in these islands, and it is under a greater threat in Scotland than here, we will not be able to say that it transmogrified into another language.  It will be dead.  The riches of a world culture, a world literature, a culture that goes back 2,000 years in written form will be lost to mankind, not just to Irish people.  Some 50 universities around the world are teaching Irish as a vernacular language.  Is €17 million out of a budget of €52 billion too much to spend on the preservation of the language in the Gaeltacht?As someone who comes from outside the Gaeltacht, its preservation outside the Gaeltacht is also very important.  The Gaeltacht has been a major resource to those outside the Gaeltacht who are interested in the language.  A great number of those who love Irish and can speak it gained their knowledge and love of the language on visits to the Gaeltacht.  The two issues are inextricably entwined.  I hope the day comes that the Gaeltacht is not important because the Irish language is so robust.  We must make a fundamental decision on whether we want the language and whether we are willing to pay a modest price.  When other elements that are labelled with the Irish language, such as industry and roads, are stripped away the price is quite modest.The issue of compulsion is a myth.  It existed in the past but we must differentiate between the obligation of the State to provide all sorts of services, as highlighted by Mr. Justice Hardiman, which may pose difficulty for the State at times, and compulsion on the citizen.  Those of us who work in the State service are often obliged to do things in order to provide services to the citizen.  That is compulsion of the State, not the citizen.  The State compels the citizen, for example to fill in tax or social welfare forms, to go to great difficulty in the interaction between them.I do not believe there should be compulsion on the citizen.  I do not believe that someone who can speak Irish, play hurling, do Irish dancing or play Irish music is more Irish than someone who cannot.  However, Ireland as a totality, with its dance, its music, its games and its language——

The totality of our culture marks us out as different.  Collectively, we are more Irish because we have games, music, dance, language, comely maidens and everything that goes with it.  However, that does not translate to the individual level.  It is a collective judgment of difference.Hurling is unique to us and identifies us.  These are the images we use abroad.  Fáilte Ireland uses Irish music and dancing in promoting St. Patrick's Day.  We use an image of our difference to sell ourselves.  There is no one better than those involved in the tourism industry and, if the Ceann Comhairle will excuse me for saying so, the people of Kerry at highlighting our great culture as something positive and good.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I am glad the Ceann Comhairle is in the Chair because I wish to clarify the position in respect of the famous issue of placenames.  When the placenames order came to me for signing, I identified a number of matters in respect of which controversy might arise.  At the time, I was of the opinion that the most controversial issue related to some of the Irish forms proposed by the placenames branch and its experts.  However, I did identify a number of other issues and challenges.For the first time ever as regards the making of a placenames order, I decided that there would be a comprehensive consultation process.  I stated that I would not be satisfied with pursuing the usual course, namely, placing a few advertisements in newspapers and taking the approach that if people saw these, then well and good.  I indicated that I wanted it to be a real process.  I directed my officials to place advertisements in the newspapers and on Raidió na Gaeltachta.  I also directed them to write to every community council on Údarás na Gaeltachta's list of community organisations and to send each a copy of the placenames relevant to their areas.  Údarás na Gaeltachta, the elected authority for the Gaeltacht and of which one of the Deputies opposite's good friend, Séamus Mac Gearailt, is a member, was also informed about what was happening and discussed the matter.  After a long delay and having considered all the representations received — not one of which related to Dingle — I signed the order.A point that is often overlooked in this debate is that up until I signed the order, there was no official Irish language version of any Gaeltacht placename.  Officially, An Ceathrú Rua did not exist and the only name for the town was Carraroe.  The Act also provided for the continued use of the English language versions of placenames by any citizen.Despite the fact that Dingle is quite a sizeable Gaeltacht town and has received huge amounts of Údarás na Gaeltachta moneys, which has built factories, etc, there, I did not realise at the time that not one community organisation in the town was registered with Údarás as such.  That is extraordinary and perhaps it explains how the great debate about this matter arose, particularly on the many programmes aired on Raidió na Gaeltachta.I must stress that the ministerial order to which I refer contained thousands of placenames and despite all the debate that has taken place in recent years, only one town or locality has indicated that it did not agree with my decision.  I asked Údarás na Gaeltachta to debate the issue again and its members overwhelmingly supported the placenames order.  Any implication that this was imposed from the top onto Gaeltacht communities throughout the country does not, therefore, reflect the facts.  I pay tribute to Deputy McGinley, a Gaeltacht person, who recognised from the outset that a huge number of people find the use of the term "Gortahork" for "Gorta a'Choirce" as somewhat anomalous, particularly as the town is situated in one of the strongest Gaeltacht areas in the country.I always stated that if the people of Dingle asked me to do something that was legal, I would do it.  I met the county manager, the mayor and a number of local councillors two to three years ago and made the latter quite clear to them.  The simple answer would have been to ask me to rescind the order.  If they had asked me to rescind it, I could have done so at the stroke of a pen.  It is worth noting that they never put such a request to me.This matter has now passed beyond my remit.  It has been referred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because those involved chose to proceed under the provisions of the 1946 Act.  However, it is well known, even in Chorca Dhuibhne, that one's view on this issue depends on whether one is in the town of Dingle or outside it.  Even then, there is not unanimity regarding how we should proceed.  I hope that this issue can be put to bed, once and for all.  However, it was important that I took this opportunity to put the record straight.There has been a great deal of State policy.  Much of this is justified because a raft of such policy dates from the past.  However, we should not underestimate our achievements in respect of the Irish language.  Oireachtas na Gaeilge shows the modern face of Irish.  It shows young people speaking the language because they want to do so.  These individuals are from Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht backgrounds and they all mix happily.  There is no compulsion on those who attend.  We must, however, give credit to the Irish language organisations, which are often lambasted, for the work they have done quietly and behind the scenes.  If Cathair na Mart were offered the Oireachtas tomorrow, it would more than welcome it back not only because of the language considerations, but also because of the type of people it attracted.  I congratulate Piaras Ó Raghallaigh on what he has done and on the fantastic Oireachtas that took place.An anonymous writer stated 150 years ago that the Irish language would be dead in two generations and that it was beyond saving.  In 1950, a report based on the scéim labhairt na Gaeilge and the census from the period 1946-7 estimated that there were only 35,000 native speakers left in the Gaeltacht.  When one considers the level of emigration in the 1950s and the age profile of those involved, the fact that there are still 22,000 people in the Gaeltacht and outside the education system who still speak Irish on a daily basis shows the extraordinary resilience of the language.  In the analysis carried out at the time to which I refer, the Gaeltachtaí were thinly spread throughout the country, located in small areas and under a great deal of pressure.  In my view, the fact that 22,000 people still speak Irish shows that there is continued interest in it.I will double check the position in respect of the number of people who speak Irish.  I checked the number in recent days and to my knowledge the absolute number increased in the recent census.  What has decreased is the percentage involved.  The reason for this is that 10% of the people living in Ireland were not born here.  If that percentage is removed, the figure readjusts to its previous level.  It is a simple and easy explanation and it makes mathematical sense.  The absolute number has increased because the population has also increased.On the 1.6 million people whom it was stated can speak Irish, I accept that this figure represents those with very little Irish, those with a better level and so on.  Unfortunately, the figure does not include people such as Deputies Ring and Stanton, who have a great grá for the language but who are not perhaps very fluent.  I do not know what Deputy Ring wrote on his census form in this regard.  Let us compare the position of people with varying levels of knowledge of Irish to that of their counterparts in Scotland.  In 1950, the number of Scots Gaelic speakers was 100,000 and now it is down to 69,000.  They do not have what we do, namely, a large number of people with some knowledge of the language.  These people are incredibly important.  A large part of the audience of TG4 is made up of people who do not speak Irish every day but who feel comfortable watching Irish language programmes and listening to commentaries of matches in Irish.  If that audience was lost, major questions would be asked about the viability of TG4.If TG4 was totally dependent on the 83,000 people who speak Irish daily outside the education system, it would be far worse off.  A large pool of people watch Ros na Rún and all types of programmes on TG4.  In Croke Park everybody claps before it is translated into English when somebody announces: "Níl aon athrú ar ceachtar den dá fhoireann.  Imreoidh siad mar a roghnaíodh iad."  With modern technology, they are becoming more and more part of the Irish-using section of society and we should never denigrate them.  How many people do we see interviewed on TG4 who do not use Irish every day?  They are quite capable of conducting a face to face interview on TG4.  It seems TG4 and Raidió na Gaeltachta can get somebody to speak on every subject under the sun from every corner of the country.I must nail the myth about the Official Languages Act.

The Supreme Court articulated clearly that following various judgments in the absence of a language Act, we could have been ordered to provide any service and document in Irish if requested by a member of the public.  The Constitution clearly states that the Irish language is the first official language of the State and to date nobody has proposed to change this position.  However, the Constitution wisely made the provision that one could delimit in law the amount of services provided in Irish but this had never been done.To those who argue the Official Languages Act created new obligations for the State, I state a more tenable legal argument is that it delimited the obligations of the State to provide written and oral services through Irish to its citizens.  This express train was coming down the tracks and if I had not introduced the Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, sooner or later this House would have faced a crisis.The Constitution states all Acts of the Oireachtas must be translated.  The statement I made in Spiddal when I introduced the Act has been taken out of context time and again.  I was under continuous and increasing pressure from the Irish language movement to include more in the Act.  The meeting was not to include more but to tell the movement that I had gone to the limit of reason on what could be included.  At the meeting, I stated that despite our best efforts, advertisements and engagement with the public on the other side of the argument was not heard and that the Irish language movement was pushing me too far and I would refuse them.  I had to act for the other side of the debate and state, like Deputy Deasy, that the Irish language movement was going too far.  One can see the same today as the Deputy who spoke about the Official Languages Act is not here for the debate.I know, as does Deputy McGinley, what happened in this House and the Seanad.  Most of the amendments were from Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and of course the Opposition tabled them.  However, we did not have an English language movement organising amendments to go the other way.  Despite all the misquotes and misstatements, I ended up arguing that erecting every sign in the Gaeltacht in Irish as proposed by Senator O'Toole was off the wall.  I remember asking him how I could put a sign — it is tráthúil and mí-thráthúil — for BreastCheck in the clinic in Tír Oileán in Galway and say it had to be in Irish only.It is wrong of Deputy Deasy to infer that I single-handedly imposed this while ignoring the Constitution and the fact that it passed after thorough debate in the Houses.  My habit is to provide as much time as I can on all Stages of legislation.  If Deputy Deasy honestly thinks the duties imposed by the Official Languages Act are too onerous, let him table a Bill to amend it.  I am not afraid of debate and I would fully debate and consider his proposals.

The amount of money spent on documents for which we never receive an Irish translation and which go straight in the wastepaper basket is scandalous.  Let us stop and let us not blame the Irish language for it.This has been a useful debate and I could state a great deal more.

The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years and, through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.The Army Equitation School has in place a horse purchase board consisting of the officer commanding the equitation school, an official from the Department of Defence, the second officer commanding the equitation school and Colonel E. V. Campion (Rtd.).  The equitation school actively encourages breeders and producers who feel they have a suitable horse to contact the school to arrange for inspection and assessment with a view to purchase or lease.In 2004 the Army Equitation School had 14 international wins at competitions throughout Europe, with 13 international wins in 2005 and a further ten in 2006, including wins at Barcelona, Athens, Copenhagen and Zagreb.  The Army Equitation School has had considerable success in 2007, notably Commandant Gerry Flynn's wins on Mo Chroí in the Dublin Grand Prix, the Lisbon Grand Prix, the Drammen Grand Prix and the Vimeiro Grand Prix.  Captain Shane Carey holds this year's record for selection on the greatest number of Nations Cup teams and during 2007 he attended eight Nations Cup shows in total.  It has recently been announced that Ireland's show jumping team will be promoted to the elite Samsung Super League in 2008, which is reserved for the best eight teams in the world.  It has been recognised that Commandant Flynn's and Captain Carey's significant achievements in 2007 have assisted the Irish team in gaining re-entry to this league.  Moreover, the success of the school over recent years is testament to the quality of the riders and the horses at the school.The Army Equitation School continues to source high quality horses for competition at home and abroad and the Minister intends to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses will continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I appreciate that but during the year there are four Question Times for defence matters and it is important the Minister attends.  It is not fair to send a Minister of State for what may concern serious Government policy decisions.I welcome the Minister of State's reply.  The funding available to the Army Equitation School to purchase or lease horses is €300,000 and it can also acquire horses through patronage.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that this figure is entirely insufficient.  He outlined the successes of the equitation school but I would go further and say all our great show jumping victories in the past have involved the Army Equitation School and its great riders.  If it was resourced properly and allocated a bigger budget it could buy more and better horses.  Are there any plans to increase the budget for the purchase or lease of horses?  I remind the Minister of State that we are the only country in the world to have an Army Equitation School that competes at such a high level throughout the world.  For that reason the school is very precious and very special.  Its situation, adjacent to the Phoenix Park, would present additional opportunities if it had more and better-bred horses.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I agree with the Deputy that the quality of the horses is a very important issue.  The mission of the school requires the acquisition solely of Irish competition horses.  The school has always been able to acquire any horse deemed, after viewing and a veterinary examination, to be of sufficient quality to merit inclusion in the school.  On a number of occasions, after viewing or examination or both, horses were deemed not to be of sufficient quality.  The focus of the school is on the quality of the horses.The Deputy made reference to the figure involved.  He is correct that, in 2006, a sum of €300,000 was allocated for horse purchasing and leasing but the final expenditure at year's end totalled €442,000.  The Department will not be found wanting in this regard, subject to various issues that may arise.  This year €322,000 was allocated for purchasing and leasing.  The key point is the quality of horses that become available.  I am instancing what happened on the last occasion.  A total of 50% more was spent than was allocated.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	309	My question also dealt with the issue of breeding.  Many of our best blood lines have been exported and bought by other countries with the result that people are buying horses back from other countries.  Most of the horses competing for Ireland in the last Olympic Games were bred abroad.The Department, together with the new Horse Board Ireland, should develop a new breeding policy to encourage breeding of the right type of horse for international competitions.  It is obvious that the best type of showjumping horse is the three-quarter blooded animal as most competitions are decided on time, against the clock.  The blood horse is a more athletic animal compared to the traditional draught horse.  Has the Minister of State any notes on how the breeding problem is to be addressed?  Is it proposed to set up a national centre for breeding showjumpers?  This is an area in which our breeding has been diluted in the past by failing to concentrate on the right type of animal for competition.I suggest more dialogue and co-operation between the breeder, the international rider and the equitation school.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I will answer briefly.  I acknowledge the Deputy's point on breeding.  It is important that the Ministers for Defence, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and other Ministers liaise on this issue.  The Army Equitation School has a total of 44 horses and there is a strong emphasis on the quality of horse.  I will convey the Deputy's valid point to my ministerial colleagues.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	314	On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic, CAR, that will help strengthen security in the region.Resolution 1778 (2007) decided that the multidimensional presence would consist of (i) a new United Nations mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic, to be known as MINURCAT, with a mandate focusing on the security and protection of civilians, particularly refugees, internally displaced persons, IDPs, and civilians in danger, and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern CAR and (ii) troops deployed by the European Union with a robust authorisation to protect and support it.  In its decision of 15 October 2007, the Council of the European Union agreed a joint action to launch the ESDP mission in support of the UN operation in Chad and in the Central African Republic.More than 170,000 displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees live in camps in eastern Chad.  These people have fled from Janjaweed attacks, widespread banditry and criminality and clashes between rebel and Government forces on both sides of the porous Chad-Sudan border.  I visited Darfur in 2004 and saw for myself the great suffering being endured by the many Sudanese people in the Darfur region.The operation on which the EU is engaged is designed to provide for the creation of a safe and secure area for refugees and internally displaced persons and to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid.  The nature of the operation is fully in accordance with Ireland's traditional policy of support for and participation in peace support operations, our close engagement in Africa and our support for the United Nations, which has authorised the proposed deployment of the peacekeeping troops.The UN element of this operation is targeted primarily at supporting the civil administration in Chad and the Central African Republic to protect refugees and camps with the support of a UN police element and liaison officers.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Ireland was asked to provide the operational commander for the EU mission.  In its decisions of 2 October 2007 and 23 October 2007, the Government decided to deploy Lieutenant General Pat Nash as operational headquarters commander of the EU force on this mission, together with up to 11 additional personnel to the headquarters of the operation.  Dáil Éireann approved the deployment of Lieutenant General Nash and his personal support staff on 9 October 2007.  The operational commander has been appointed by the European Union in the joint action and is responsible for the planning and, when directed, execution of the mission.Lieutenant General Nash took up his appointment last month and is based at the operation headquarters in Mont Valérien, Paris.  He has assumed immediate leadership in the planning and launch of the operation.  The role of the operation commander is to manage and co-ordinate the overall military operation and to provide the military link between the operation and MINURCAT, the EU and the UN.  The EU is planning to launch this operation as a matter of urgency.  The intention is to have an initial operational capability on the ground next month with the operation fully functional in January-February 2008.The mission of the EUFOR TCHAD-RCA is to contribute to establishing a safe and secure environment in the area of operation, in order to protect civilians in danger, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel through improved security, protect UN and associated personnel and encourage the return of internally displaced persons.

The remainder of the reply will be put into the record of the House.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The fact that he has been to Darfur gives him a particular insight into this area.The reason for my question is the recent reports of attempts being made to take 103 African children, so-called orphans, out of Chad, to be either fostered or perhaps adopted.  It is a cause for concern that these children referred to belonging to a family.  A total of 91 children referred to at least one parent in the family.  The group consisted of 21 girls and 81 boys between the ages of one and ten.  When the situation of child sex abuse and paedophilia is taken into account, this must be a matter of great concern.I presume the Minister of State will reassure the House that with the Irish involvement in MINURCAT and the fact that the commanding officer is Irish, this area will be given a strong focus.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I can answer with a definite yes.  We are all honoured that the operational commander is Lieutenant General Pat Nash, who is known to many of us in the House.  He is an excellent Army officer.I concur completely with the Deputy that the issue of trafficking of young people is regarded by the Government as one of paramount importance.With regard to the MINURCAT mission and as I saw on my recent visit to Kosova, Ireland has an excellent record in working with communities and building trust.  On the specific issue of the children, dealing with criminality and trafficking is primarily the responsibility of the Chadean Government.  However, the EU operation in Chad and in CAR is designed to provide for the creation of safe and secure areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid.  Implicit in this role for the EU mission within its area of operation and its mandate will be to intervene if such issues come to its attention.  In the event of Ireland becoming involved, which I hope will be the case, we will need to note these concerns.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Is this one of the issues to be addressed by the reconnaissance mission?  Will there be a report on this matter?  Will any information about serious issues be made available to the House before a final commitment of participation in MINURCAT is made?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	321	This will definitely be the case.  We will be dealing with this issue in another question.  I will be happy to deal with all issues relating to Chad.  The reconnaissance mission is taking place and it will make a report.  The Government is required to seek the approval of the Dáil for participation in this mission.  I hope this will be the case but much work remains to be done.  This could not be described as a safe mission and there are many issues to be considered by the reconnaissance mission.  The House will be fully informed before its ultimate decision.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I have already provided the background information on this mission in my response to Question No. 2.As the planning for the mission is currently ongoing, I am not in a position at this stage to provide detailed projected costs of possible Defence Forces participation in the EU operation.  However, I can confirm that the costs will be significant.  Given the isolation of the mission area and difficulty with the land routes — CHAD is landlocked and nearly 2,000 km from the nearest port facility — the deployment and sustainment of the operation will have to be mainly by air.  In addition, the provision of suitably equipped sites, provision of airstrip etc., will be required.  More information on the associated costs of participation in the mission will be available when the report of the reconnaissance mission is provided to the Minister for Defence.  The Government will be advised accordingly when the formal decision on participation in the force is presented for consideration.The financing of the operation will be dealt with in the context of the Estimates process, which is ongoing.  All EU member states, irrespective of participation, will contribute to the common costs of the operation, unless they specifically opt out of doing so at Council.  Common costs are payable, in accordance with EU Council Decision of 17 June 2002, through the ATHENA mechanism, which is responsible at EU level for the collection of member states contributions and disbursement of monies received in respect of operational common costs.  Each troop contributing nation also meets its own nation borne costs while direct operational costs for members contributing personnel are met on a "costs lie where they fall" basis.In the event that it is ultimately decided to participate with 350 to 400 troops in the mission, the combination of common costs and nation borne costs may make this the most expensive mission ever undertaken by the Defence Forces.  I mentioned that earlier.The Minister expects to bring proposals to Government shortly and, subject to the approval of the Government, to put the matter before Dáil Éireann before the end of November.  Obviously, any decision to participate will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Defence Acts.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I understand it is expected that the mission will cost approximately €60 million.  Will the Minister of State confirm that this €60 million will not be taken out of mainstream funding for the Defence Forces?  At present, there is major pressure on different elements of the Defence Forces for ongoing funding.  Certainly the Defence Forces are not robust enough to make €60 million available at this time.  Will the Minister of State confirm that provision will be made in the Estimates?I asked also about the transport element of the mission to which the Minister of State did not refer in his response.  Has any costing been made of the transport element of the particular mission?  May I ask a question I put to the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, four or five weeks ago?  Is it time to consider purchasing our own aircraft in order that we can have our own air transport capability?  If this is not possible within the Defence budget perhaps we could look at our overseas aid budget so that it could be used by the Department of Defence, operated by the Air Corps, and for humanitarian purposes also.  Will the Minister of State agree that our transport capability would help considerably in humanitarian cases of moving Irish aid?The two questions are as follows.  Will provision for the mission be made in the Estimates?  Given the cost of leasing aircraft, would it be a good idea to consider purchasing our own aircraft?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I will take the questions in reverse order.  On the issue of the aircraft, I understand that as part of the background planning for potential participation in the mission the Defence Forces are examining a range of strategic lift options for the deployment of Defence Forces personnel and their sustainment in the region.  It is difficult terrain, as the Deputy will appreciate.  The Defence Forces have standby arrangements in place in this regard, mainly involving commercial suppliers.  Obviously discussions are ongoing with our EU partners.  There are no plans to acquire large long-range transport aircraft for the Defence Forces.  The costs involved, relative to the expected level of utilisation, would not justify the procurement of such an aircraft.  That is the position of the Government on that matter.  It will be expensive.On the matter of costs, this whole issue is being dealt with as part of the Estimates process.  The report of the reconnaissance mission and more information on equipment requirements, logistical support and transport costs is expected to be provided for the Minister for Defence in the coming weeks.  The Government will be advised accordingly when the formal decision on participation in the force is presented for consideration later this month.  The specific answer to the Deputy's question is that we do not have a figure for costs.  We are still awaiting the evaluation.  The House will be told about this specifically and will then decide on it — I hope we do.  When going in there we will ensure the troops are well equipped and that every possible care and attention is taken with regard to their safety.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Will the Minister of State examine the feasibility of having our own transport capability?  While he said it would not be economical to have our own transport capability, I understand the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is receptive to this idea.  Certainly senior members in the Army are receptive to the idea of small transport planes that could be used for military and humanitarian purposes.  Apparently there is a very strong case for that capability.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to look at the issue seriously?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I will respond clearly as I would to any suggestion made in the House.  I visited about 23 countries in Africa as Minister for overseas development on two occasions and my experience is that the Department of Foreign Affairs has used small aircraft in different situations in supporting the NGO effort.  On the Defence side there are other supports through the UN.  In Liberia I used some of the helicopters which were being used by the UN there.  Of course I will be glad to pursue the suggestion the Deputy made.  My gut feeling is that in analysing the costs it is better to use whatever commercial aircraft we can.  We have a particular contribution to make with regard to our personnel.  I have seen it in many places, such as Liberia and Kosovo.  I have no doubt the same will happen here.  We have to concentrate on what we are good at.  Should we get a large aircraft?  Is it cost effective?  My feeling is that it would not be, but we can certainly make contributions elsewhere.  The Deputy asked me to re-examine the matter and I will be happy to do that.  This issue has been raised with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	327	A claim for an increase in overseas allowance was received from the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The claim has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and the representative associations.  The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time other than to say that the claim will have to meet the terms of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I remind the Minister of State that his senior colleague made a commitment at the PDFORRA conference of 2006 that if PDFORRA made a case for an increase in allowances he would receive it very favourably.  The understanding at the time was that an increase of 10% to 15% would be requested, but I understand that what is on offer is just 5%.  The overseas allowance ranges from €74 to €80.  In essence, for the lower paid this will mean an increase of €3.72 per day and for the higher paid €4 per day.  Surely that is not a great incentive.  They are not doing it for the money but they want their service valued.The Government will soon be recruiting for Chad which will be a very dangerous mission.  An article in today's edition of The Irish Times pointed out that this will be the most dangerous mission since the Congo.  Surely these people should be properly paid and should receive the proper incentives.  Will the Minister of State expand on what he has said?  Will serious consideration be given to increasing the allowance to between 10% and 15%?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I have no doubt whatsoever about the contribution made by our peacekeepers abroad.  There is no harm in reiterating time and again the tremendous work they do throughout the world in very dangerous situations.  I start on that basis and totally concur with the Deputy.In his address to the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association annual delegate conference in 2006 the Minister for Defence invited the association to submit a claim for an increase in overseas allowance.  A claim for an increase in the allowance from PDFORRA and RACO was subsequently received and, as I said in my reply, is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I again acknowledge the work they do abroad — we all value their work.  However, whether an overseas allowance is warranted is a matter to be determined through the conciliation and arbitration process, subject to the requirements of the current national wage agreement.  There is a process through which this claim must be addressed.  I cannot go beyond that.  The discussions in the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties involved and it would not be appropriate for me to comment other than to acknowledge, as the Deputy has already done, the tremendous work being done by our personnel abroad.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	330	A clear signal is coming out that 5% will not be adequate or acceptable.  I ask the Minister of State to support as much as possible an increase of 10% to 15%, given that the Minister accepted the principle of an increase at the conference in October 2006.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	331	It is obvious that any Minister or Minister of State like myself would be very supportive of the work our Army personnel do abroad.  The Minister invited PDFORRA to make its claim and the process is now under way.  We need to allow that process to develop.  While we must acknowledge the work that has been done, we cannot interfere in this process.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The strength of the Army ranger wing, ARW, as a percentage of its establishment is in the region of 90%.  The strength is sufficient to meet anticipated operational requirements.  The ARW actively pursues a policy of recruitment to maintain strength levels and the delivery of required military capabilities.  The unit recruits from all services with a continual advertising campaign by means of: road shows and seminars in brigades, corps, the Naval Service and Air Corps conducted by ARW personnel; and advertising in the Defence Forces Connect magazine and An Cosantóir journal.Induction is by ARW selection courses run on an annual and biannual basis as required.  Interest from Permanent Defence Force, PDF, personnel in joining the ARW remains at a very high level.  All serving members of the PDF are entitled to apply, provided they are medically fit and have attained the rank of at least three-star private or equivalent.  Successful passing of the selection course demands the highest levels of fitness, motivation and competency.  There is a continual review of criteria for entry.  However, it is critical that the high standards required for entry into the ARW are maintained in order to deliver the strategic capabilities and specialised response required by the Government.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Does the Minister of State have the establishment figure for the ARW?  I understand that five people left the wing this year and have not been replaced.  Last year 100 people applied to join the Army ranger wing.  Eventually approximately three were recruited.  However, this year only 15 people applied and no course has taken place.  Obviously if five people left this year and there is natural wastage it is clear that the Army ranger wing numbers will be depleted.  Would the Minister of State agree that this is the elite wing of our Army?  If we agree to go to Chad the ARW will be the forerunner of the main mission and will prepare the ground.  They are highly trained and as good as any in the world.  They can parachute and dive.  They are medics and all-rounders.  It is important that this wing of the Army is maintained at its present level and people should be encouraged to join.  If the Minister of State can give me the figures, he might also be able to explain why there has been a fall-off in numbers and people are not applying to join the rangers.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	334	For security and operational reasons it has not been military practice to publish exact details of the establishment or actual strength of the ARW.  There is merit in sticking to that position.  It is critical that the high standards required for entry into the unit are maintained.  However, the unit and operation staff review entry standards on an ongoing basis.  Regarding the numbers, following the ARW deployment in Liberia there was a significant increase in the number of applicants as a result of the positive exposure to other PDF personnel.  A constant interest is displayed by personnel on entry standards to the ARW.  In the past two years the number of applicants presenting for the selection course has decreased and this may be attributed to increased opportunities available to soldiers serving overseas.The Deputy is right to highlight that this is an elite group with very high standards.  We are certainly interested in continuing to promote the need to maintain the standards and numbers of this elite corps.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	335	These people value their position and status.  Just to have their service valued in the same way as the people going to Chad, the extra €150 that they earn above what they would earn in other sections of the Army may not be a sufficient incentive for people to join the rangers.  Obviously they are more exposed to injury.  If they get injured in their duties for the Army ranger wing, they are likely to be discharged from the Army, as they would not meet the medical requirements to rejoin mainstream Army activities.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the allowance for membership of the wing and to consider the issue of being discharged from the Army following a serious injury because of the stricter requirements in mainstream defence activities in the country now.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	336	It is not appropriate for me to comment on unresolved claims submitted under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I believe a number of factors motivate members of the Defence Forces regarding the ARW, including the nature of the activities, training and roles of the ARW, as well as personal motivation.  We want to see all these matters resolved by agreement with the association.  Discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on that aspect.I greatly value the role of this elite corps.  I have had personal experience of seeing them in operation.  They work to a very high standard and are very effective and professional in the work they do.  Many different factors motivate people to join up.  We are very conscious of the need to maintain those high standards and I will take on board the points made by the Deputy.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 19 together.The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an eight-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those eight vessels.  The White Paper specifically provides that "new vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service vessels are generally replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally approximately 30 years.  Three ships will fall due for replacement over the next few years —LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aisling, commissioned in 1980.Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service a vessel replacement strategy has been put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The vessel replacement strategy combined with a continual process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is commensurate with the roles assigned to it.Following Government approval in July 2007 to go to tender, notice of a competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the EU Journal on 24 August 2007.  The competition for the purchase of two offshore patrol vessels, with an option of a third and one extended patrol vessel, with an option on a second, will be subject to a restricted procurement procedure in accordance with EU procurement directives.  The process comprises two stages — stage 1, a request for proposals, and stage 2, an invitation to tender.  The closing date for stage 1 - receipt of proposals — was 26 October 2007.  Following evaluation of proposals, a detailed specification will issue to those invited to participate in stage 2.  The evaluation of stage 1 proposals and the preparation of the detailed specification for stage 2 is ongoing.  The invitation to tender is expected to issue in May 2008, with tenders due in July-August.  Following detailed tender evaluation, it is intended to award a contract in late 2008-early 2009.  To ensure the integrity of the competition process, I will not release details relating to the numbers and-or names of the respondents to the request for proposals until the entire competition process has concluded.The decision to proceed with the final award of contract to purchase the vessels will be subject to further Government approval and agreement on funding, the full requirement for which will not be known until the tender competition has concluded, and, therefore, financing arrangements have not been put in place.  It is expected the cost of the three new ships will be of the order of €180 million, excluding VAT.  Once details of costs are known, funding arrangements will be a matter for further consideration in consultation with the Minister for Finance in the context of the Estimates process.  It is expected the vessels will be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply but I am disappointed he is unable to reveal the number of applications and other details of the procurement process.  Will provision be made in this year's Estimates for the funding for the procurement of three vessels if the project is going to tender in May?  Has consideration been given to the manning of the vessels?  They will be new and modern and will require an increased staffing complement.  Have plans been put in place to ensure personnel will be available when the vessels are commissioned?The Minister of State will be aware of the general low morale among Naval Service staff.  The report, A Voyage of Understanding, stated morale among Navy personnel is quite low.  This is understandable because they operate in antiquated, rough conditions. I hope to take a trip in a naval vessel next January to experience the conditions in which naval personnel sleep, eat and so on.  What provision is being made in the Estimates for the commissioning of the ships?  Has consideration been given to the staffing of the ships when they are acquired?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I outlined the ongoing process, which comprises tendering and so on, and the timescale attaching to it.  Once details of the costs are known, funding arrangements will be a matter for further consideration in consultation with the Minister for Finance in the context of the Estimates process.  That will kick in at a certain time.  Many of the ships have a set lifespan.  The LE Emer was commissioned in 1978, for example.  Part of the costings is the sale of the old vessels.  The value of a ship will be determined by the market when it is offered for sale.  As vessels will not be withdrawn from service until shortly before the commissioning of the replacements, it would be unwise to say anything that might influence that process.  The sale, for example, of the LE Deirdre in 2001, the most recent vessel to be disposed of, realised €270,000.  The old vessels must be sold and one can tell, on the basis of the date they were commissioned, when they are due for release.  They have to be sold and the new vessels purchased.  The Estimates process will kick in at the appropriate time.I take on board the Deputy's comments regarding morale and staffing.  Morale is an issue to which attention is paid by the Department and the Minister at all times.  Plans must be made on staffing in conjunction with planning for the increased number of ships.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I take it that state of the art will be the criterion for accommodation and eating facilities on board the new vessels.  The Minister of State referred to the assigned roles for the vessels.  Has thought gone into enhancing their role in support of the civil authorities, for example, in intercepting illegal shipments of drugs and so on into the State?  When the vessels are commissioned in 2010, will they enhance the capability of the Naval Service and the civilauthorities to deal more effectively with this issue?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	341	On the basis of the analysis conducted, the group concluded that two different types of vessels are required to allow the Naval Service to continue to have a presence and to undertake its assigned tasks throughout Ireland's 200 mile exclusive economic zone into the future.  Vessels are expected to remain in service for 30 years.  Issues such as deteriorating sea and weather conditions must also be taken into account.With regard to the role of the new ships, the vessels will undertake the standard range of duties assigned to the Naval Service, including fisheries protection, search and rescue, maritime protection, drug interdiction, anti-pollution and maritime security.  The ships will carry primary and secondary armaments, similar to those deployed on the current vessels.  Details of the exact type and number will be decided at a later date in the context of the final design and specification for the vessels.  Clearly, state-of-the-art equipment will be sought.  The Minister and the Department are keen that the best equipment would be used for the staff.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  Does the Government accept the use of the offshore patrol vessels will be an important part of a strategy to deal with crime and particularly the importation of drugs?  Does the Minister of State accept that, in conjunction with these vessels, the use of smaller vessels along our coastline could also be effective in targeting the gangs who import drugs and who are destroying our young people and causing major havoc on the streets of Dublin?  He mentioned a cost of approximately €180 million for the offshore vessels.  Over how many years will that amount be spent?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The costs will have to be worked out as the process evolves because when the ships have been commissioned, their lifespan of 30 years must be included in calculations.  For example, the LE Emer was commissioned in 1978, the LE Aoife in 1979, the LE Aisling in 1980 and the LE Eithne in 1984.  Costs will arise through an incremental period.I agree with the Deputy that drug trafficking is a key issue to be addressed, particularly on the basis of recent examples.  Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking and other such illegal activities rests primarily with the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service in this important area.  In particular, the larger vessel proposed will enable the Naval Service to patrol over a greater range and for longer periods than is possible at present and accordingly will provide an added deterrent to likely drug traffickers.The Deputy is right in saying we need a combination of larger and smaller vessels.  In fact, I understand there are three types: the CPV, the coastal patrol vessel; the OPV, the offshore patrol vessel; and the EPV, the extended patrol vessel.  They are looking at all of these options.  Also, bulk buying is an issue.  Two can be bought instead of one, for instance.  There is much work to be done, the process is ongoing and we have to meet the requirements because of the lifespan of these vessels.  We certainly take on board what Deputies have said here today.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I thank the Deputy, and I am sorry.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Deputy has another short supplementary.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I am very magnanimous in this House.  Definitely, the three vessels in question are both unsafe and uneconomical at this stage, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree.  As he says, the useful life of a ship is 30 years.  Will he agree these vessels are totally inadequate to police our 132,000 square miles of water, from a fishery viewpoint, and we have EU obligations to patrol our entire fishery ground, which is up to 200 miles offshore?  We are not doing that adequately since we do not have the capacity for it.  That is why as well as replacing these vessels we should add to our flotilla as well.  Apart from the objective of eight in the flotilla are there plans for any additional vessels, smaller faster ones, as Deputy Finian McGrath said, that could enter coves and be very good for detecting drug shipments, which apparently are coming into Ireland virtually on a daily basis and we just cannot intercept them?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I obviously agree with the Deputy that ships should be replaced when they come to the end of their useful life.  That normally happens after 30 years and it has to be done.  Members of all parties support that.  The LE Eithne and the LE Ciara will have 30 years service completed in 2014, while the LE Orla will reach that longmark in 2015.  What needs to be done is staring us in the face.  I accept that there are new issues, particularly drugs, to deal with.  There are many other challenges and that is why we are looking at a wide range of ships in this instance.  I have great confidence in those who are negotiating this whole process for us.  I mentioned earlier that consultation is taking place with the relevant stakeholders and there is a major analysis under way of the deteriorating weather conditions being experienced in the Atlantic by the Naval Service.  There is a good deal of terrain to be dealt with.  This is based on the work being done by the vessel replacement study group from data supplied by the Meteorological Office.  They are looking at that aspect and at the need for different sizes of ships.  The OPVs will be in the 80 m to 90 m range, similar to the LE Róisín and LE Niamh and the EPV will be larger, in the 130 m to 140 m range.  They are going about their work in the right way and will certainly report back to the House.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The Minister did not mention this in his speech and is not currently considering the possibility of the recruitment of an additional 1,000 personnel to the Defence Forces.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper, that is, up to 2010.  This remains the position.  It is intended to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.To facilitate the Defence Forces in maintaining strength at 10,500 An Agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training, at any given time.  The military authorities and the Department are considering the planning and resources necessary to meet this provision.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I accept that this was not contained in the Minister's speech.  However, he was reported as speaking at the conference and that is the context in which it is being raised at this stage.  This came, on the suggestion of PDFORRA, against the background of a greater role for the Irish Defence Force in international peacekeeping.  We dealt with the fact that additional personnel will be required by the Naval Service when the new vessels come on stream.  At this stage, is the Minister saying there is no particular consideration within the Department in terms of increasing the current figure of 10,500?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The issue was not referred to by the Minister in his speech, but there was an informal press gathering and the Minister responded to a suggestion from PDFORRA that the Defence Forces strength be increased by 1,000.  He made it clear that there would be no immediate revision of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, numbers.  It is Government policy that the current strength of 10,000 is sufficient to meet all militarily needs.  The Minister pointed out, however, that a review of Government policy on strengths might be included as part of the preparation of a new White Paper.  An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to the preparation of a new White Paper on Defence for the period 2011-2020.  It can be expected that this White Paper will review the defence and security environment and the role and capability of the Army, Naval Service, Air Corps and reserves.  That is the focus on which the Minister and I should like to concentrate.  All of these issues can be looked at in the new White Paper.  We are satisfied that we have adequate personnel at the moment, approximately 8,400 in the Army, 850 in the Air Corps and 1,068 in the Naval Service.  We maintain that these figures are adequate while saying that the position can be reviewed in the new White Paper.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I welcome the Minister of State's answer on the Minister's speech.  On the putative figure of 1,000 more personnel, that would represent a major cost to the Exchequer and I would be concerned about this.  The present figure of 10,500 is adequate for our current needs.  Will the Minister of State accept that if we were to employ 1,000 extra personnel, it would be better to employ public servants in terms of frontline services such as health, education, disabilities and to provide help for cystic fibrosis patients, for instance?  Will he agree that should be our focus over the next two to three years?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I agree with the Deputy.  The strength of 10,500 as stipulated in the White Paper was determined after a good deal of analysis of all the relevant factors.  This included a programme of reform and reorganisation to ensure "that Ireland has a world class military organisation".  I am satisfied the Defence Forces have the capacity to deal with the changes that have taken place in the defence and security environment since the publication of the White Paper.  I have been very fortunate as a Minister of State in various areas, in particular to have experienced the work the Defence Forces do abroad.  The White Paper provides for the allocation of up to 850 members of the Permanent Defence Force to be deployed overseas at any one time.  While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployment above this level is not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.We have had a good discussion on Chad and if we get to it, there may be further discussion.  Any commitments to an EU or UN mission will be met within this context.  It is important to maintain the high standard and fantastic quality of the work we do.  It is best to do this with the types of numbers we have provided for.  At present, some 460 members of the Permanent Defence Force are deployed overseas.  Clearly, that will increase if we become involved in Chad, as I hope we will.  Certainly, we will look at this issue in the context of the next White Paper.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The military authorities have clarified the position regarding the inclusion of Brazilian beef in ration packs supplied to the Defence Forces under contract.A tender competition for the supply of ration packs to the Defence Forces was advertised in the  Official Journal of the European Union and conducted in accordance with national and EU public procurement rules.  All quotations received came from companies in the United Kingdom although tenders were sent to a range of companies based in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  European Union public procurement rules do not permit product specifications — for any product or component of a product — to identify a particular brand name, supplier or country of origin.  As a result of the competition, the contract to supply ration packs to the Defence Forces from January 2007 to December 2008 was awarded to Far Side Marketing, located in Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom.Main meals containing beef are included in 25% of all ration packs purchased annually by the Defence Forces. These meals are manufactured by a number of specialist manufacturers in the United Kingdom and Germany.  In general, beef from Europe is used.  However, in one consignment of pack rations delivered to the Defence Forces in early 2007, the beef-based main meals did contain beef of Brazilian origin, amounting to approximately 500 meals.  In this case, the total quantity of beef was approximately 150 kg.  To date, 25,000 ration packs have been purchased under the current contract, 6,000 of which contained beef, of which only 500 contained Brazilian beef.  Brazil is an EU-approved third country for the purpose of importation of meat products.The military authorities have assured me that fresh beef consumed by the Defence Forces on a daily basis is sourced in Ireland from local producers.  Approximately 93,000 kg of fresh beef, valued at €450,000, is purchased annually by the Defence Forces compared to approximately 1,200 kg of beef, valued at €12,000, in ration packs.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  While health and safety issues do not apply in this case, we realise vigilance is very important in light of the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Surrey.  What consultation has the Minister of State's Department had with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and other relevant authorities to ascertain that there is no possibility that the product in question could eventually bring foot and mouth disease into Ireland?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Food safety is of primary importance and, as the Deputy indicated, it is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has assured me that detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat, as well as to imports of these products from third countries.  Under this harmonised legislation, a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health.  The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Union.It is required that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in and trade between member states and all meat imports must come from third countries, or areas thereof, approved for export to the Union.  Brazil is so approved.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food welcomed the publication by the EU Commission of the report on the Food and Veterinary Office's mission to Brazil.  She said it will be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence and added she is now calling for a discussion on the report within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.  The Minister also noted that a further Food and Veterinary Office mission is taking place this month and stated the Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection has assured her personally that he will not hesitate to take appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country represents a risk to the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants.  There is very strong liaison between my Department and that of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on such issues.

The IFA DVD on the Brazilian beef market, which was distributed recently, highlighted many of the issues that arise.  The use of Brazilian beef by the Defence Forces would be a cause for concern.I am disappointed that the Fine Gael Private Members' motion of recent weeks was not accepted by the Minister of State's party.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  We will continue to purchase beef and other foodstuffs for the Defence Forces in line with national and EU procurement legislation.  The military authorities assured me that fresh beef consumed by the Defence Forces daily is sourced from local Irish producers.The issue in question concerns the supply of ration packs to the Defence Forces.  The contract was awarded to Far Side Marketing.  It is worth noting that no Irish company entered the competition but we would be glad to see them coming forward.  We should encourage our producers to become involved in the production of ration packs.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Minister of State is aware that the IFA has described this particular purchase as a disgrace.  It did so in the context of its own visit to Brazil to assess its beef industry.  I understand the Minister of State is saying procurement regulations were adhered to and that all the information presently available to the Department suggests there is no danger to animal health.  Is he asserting that the situation is monitored constantly by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and that immediate action will be taken if any concerns are flagged to his Department by the monitoring Department?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	362	That is a fair assessment.  We must abide by EU procurement legislation and do so as a responsible member state.  This matter has been well rehearsed in the media and we know the position of the IFA.  The Department will comply with the relevant national and EU food safety legislation designed to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health.  We apply the highest of standards.  I took the opportunity today to outline the position of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and we will certainly ensure the House is kept updated on this issue.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 13, 15, 26, 34, 36 and 38 together.On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution No. 1778 establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  The resolution stipulated that the multidimensional presence would consist of (i) a new United Nations mission in Chad and the Central African Republic, to be known as MINURCAT, with a mandate focusing on the security and protection of civilians — particularly refugees, internally displaced persons and civilians in danger — and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and the north-eastern region of the Central African Republic; and (ii) troops deployed by the European Union with robust authorisation to protect and support it.The operation on which the EU is engaged is designed to provide for the creation of a safe and secure area for refugees and internally displaced persons and to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid.  The nature of the operation is fully in accordance with Ireland's traditional policy of support for and participation in peace support operations, our close engagement in Africa and our support for the United Nations, which has authorised the proposed deployment of the peacekeeping troops.Following Government and Dáil approval last month, acting Lieutenant General Pat Nash has taken up the position of operation commander of the EU military operation with four support staff at EU operational headquarters at Mont Valérien, Paris, France.   A further six Defence Forces personnel were deployed late last month, following Government approval, for service at the headquarters of the EU operation.  These staff will assist in ensuring the timely preparation and development of operational and logistical plans, rules of engagement, operational concepts etc. for the operation, which are currently being prepared.A report on the proposed operation, following a detailed reconnaissance of the mission area and tasking, together with a threat assessment, is currently being completed.  This will inform the final decision on the nature of our participation and the requirements in terms of force protection and other defence assets, should the Government decide to deploy troops on the ground in Chad.  Subject to a satisfactory assessment, the Irish Defence Force contribution is expected to be in the region of 350 to 400 personnel.The proposed EU force could comprise up to 4,000 personnel, the most significant element of which will be a French contribution. The force generation process to meet the EU operation commander's requirements to conduct the mission is currently under way.  Other contributors currently include Sweden, Spain, Poland, Finland and Belgium.  It is anticipated that further contributors to this mission will indicate their position at the force generation conference that will be held in Brussels tomorrow.I understand that all troop-contributing nations will provide a role 1 medical facility.  This medical support includes the capability to provide first aid, immediate lifesaving measures and triage.  Planning arrangements are under way at EU level for the provision of higher levels of medical facilities, with appropriate ground and air MedEvac capabilities.The Defence Forces are examining a range of support provisions, such as leave, postal arrangements, telephone and Internet access, which would be put in place for Irish troops should the Government decide to deploy a contingent to the EU operation.As the planning for the mission is currently ongoing, I am not in a position to state categorically the details of logistical support for, and the projected costs of, the possible Defence Forces participation in the EU operation.  However, in respect of the costs of the overall EU operation and the proposed Irish deployment as part of this operation, I can say that these will be significant.  Given the isolation of the mission area and difficulty with the land routes — Chad is landlocked and nearly 2,000 km from the nearest port facility — the deployment and sustainment of the operation will have to be mainly by air.  In addition, the provision of suitably equipped sites and airstrips will also be required.  More information on equipment requirements and logistical support will be available when the report of the reconnaissance mission is provided to the Minister for Defence.  The Government will be advised accordingly when the formal decision on participation in the force is presented for consideration.Expenditure to date on preparations for possible Defence Forces participation in the mission has been limited.  The financing of the operation will be dealt with in the context of the Estimates process, which is currently ongoing.The Minister expects to bring proposals to Government shortly and, subject to the approval of the Government, to put the matter before Dáil Éireann before the end of November.  Obviously, any decision to participate will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Defence Acts.  I apologise for the length of the reply but there were seven questions involved.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I am concerned about the terrain and the number of rebels in Chad.  As the Minister of State is aware, the number of refugees in Chad is estimated to be 400,000.  In recent years, the area has been convulsed by violence.  Clashes between the local ethnic and tribal groups run in tandem with guerilla attacks so there are fears for the safety of troops going out there.The mission should be clearly set from the start.  The EU force must make it clear to the population that it wants to serve and do what it can do for it.  The people need to know what they can expect, what the force's mandate is and what it will do when it is out there.I have concerns about some rebel groups who have said that they will attack the forces if they get in the way.  In addition, it is impossible to police the entire zone, given the terrain of the country.  It is really too big and the number of troops involved — 4,300 — might not be enough.  Can the Minister of State tell me about the exit strategy?  How does he see it panning out over the next few years?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I mentioned earlier that I had some personal experience of this a few years ago, admittedly in 2004 towards the end of my time as Minister of State with responsibility for development, when I visited Darfur and found out about the security situation and dangers there.  I pay tribute to the non-governmental organisations who are working in very dangerous situations.  Obviously, I have been following developments there since due to my interest.I went on a particular journey with John O'Shea of GOAL across a very isolated area for a number of hours.  There is no doubt that we travelled through an area where the Janjaweed and other rebel groups were present so I am very conscious of the security situation in Darfur and this neighbouring area.The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to the Government.  While no absolute guarantee can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in the mission, it goes without saying that it is policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission.  All possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our troops.  In addition, standard operating procedures are kept under review in light of experience and best practice.From my own experience of visiting other fairly dangerous parts of the world, among them Liberia, I can say that getting interoperability with personnel from other countries right is a key point.  As I said earlier, there will be a further meeting tomorrow with regard to who does what.  All that preparation is taking place and I am delighted that our own officer, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, will be involved in that as he is a very capable person.Our roles will be specific and we will be well equipped and clearly working with others.  We will have particular roles as countries will have different roles.  I know that issues with regard to the medical backup and our capability have been raised.  We must combine and pool our resources in all of these areas.  I am satisfied that all the preparations will be made.  In respect of matters like equipment and training, I am satisfied that everything possible is being done.  We assure Members that the safety of our personnel is paramount at all times.

Details are also available on the Department of Defence website, www.defence.ie.The Taoiseach announced, in the context of the 90th anniversary celebrations of 1916, that the Government had decided to make the military pension archive available to historians and to the public.  It is the intention of the Government that the records will be made available in good time for the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 2016.  The archivists will assist in this process.A total of seven archivists, including a senior archivist-project manager, are being recruited.  The senior archivist-project manager, along with three of the archivists, will work on the military pensions project.  The other three archivists will be recruited to work at the military archive itself to meet day-to-day demands.

I am sure the Minister of State is aware that there is no definitive list of those killed during the War of Independence and the Civil War.  In its manifesto, the Labour Party gave a commitment to tackle this issue, particularly in the context of the Civil War.  Does the Minister of State see this as an appropriate task to be undertaken with regard to the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising?

Broughan — the need to change the guidelines on the governance of integrated local development companies and urban based partnerships; (3) Deputy Martin Ferris — the EU veterinary report on Brazilian beef; and (4) Deputy Tony Gregory — the delay in providing a permanent school building in Dublin 7.The matters raised by Deputies Joe Costello, Thomas P. Broughan, Martin Ferris and Tony Gregory have been selected for discussion.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this item.  I am also pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, who is responsible for this area, is here.It seems there is no sense of urgency on the part of the Government in communicating the contents of the reform treaty to the people of Ireland.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach, asking him what were his proposals for the lead-up to the ratification of the reform treaty.  Amazingly, he answered briefly, stating that there were none at this stage.  It was an incredible answer.  Ireland is the only one of 27 countries that must undergo a referendum, all other countries will ratify the treaty by a vote in parliament.  There is an onus on Ireland to get it right.There is an onus to transmit information as quickly as possible.  The reform treaty is not the most simple document.  It is difficult to read and unintelligible to the layman.  The constitutional treaty was in a different format and was a well-written consolidation document.  The reform treaty is an amendment of the other seven treaties and is written in legalese.  It is easy to understand if one is a lawyer but the people who will vote on it will find it difficult to understand.The Taoiseach stated he could not produce any plans until Ireland formally signed the document on 13 December.  However, the Government approved the document on 16 October, nearly two months before it will be signed.  The text was approved on that occasion in Brussels.  All that remains is for the 27 member states to formally sign what they have approved.  There is no reason the Government should delay in preparing for the ratification.The Joint Committee on European Affairs met this week and was full of enthusiasm for inviting Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament, holding meetings in the provinces and holding public meetings.  Its response is to play a major role.  The National Forum on Europe, which I attended this morning, produced a document on what it proposed, including meetings and publications.  The Government, which has already approved the text, and which will sign the text on our behalf pending ratification, shows no leadership.  I am worried that we will see a repetition of the Nice treaty.  In 2001 the Irish people rejected that treaty initially because they were ignorant of the contents.  The Fianna Fáil-led Government showed similar negligence and inertia in communicating the contents in a legible fashion.The Minister of State is enthusiastic about ratification but the Taoiseach's reply shows no sense of urgency at the highest point of leadership.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Cabinet discusses this as a matter of urgency and that we communicate the sense of urgency to the Houses and the country at large.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I am grateful to Deputy Costello for raising this matter because it is important to have a full, frank, open and honest debate on the issue.  The reform treaty was agreed by European Heads of State and Government at the informal European Council in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October.  It is planned that the treaty will be signed at the European Council in December.  Thereafter, the treaty will need to be ratified by each member state.After 50 years of European integration, the EU treaties were in need of updating.  That process has been under way since the European Convention in which I participated with former Deputies John Bruton and De Rossa.  Deputies Gormley and Pat Carey operated as alternates.The reform treaty is an important achievement for the EU.  We now have a treaty that will allow the European Union to turn away from institutional reform and focus instead on delivering tangible benefits to our citizens.  The treaty preserves the essential substance and balance of the draft European constitution, which was the product of lengthy and inclusive negotiations culminating during Ireland's 2004 EU Presidency.  It is a pity the treaty is not contained in a single document.  That is the format we would have wished for but events conspired to change the circumstances.The treaty will serve to equip the European Union to deal with the challenges of the future.  Ratification of the EU reform treaty will be a priority for the Government.  It is, of course, a matter for each country to determine how it will ratify the treaty and most of our EU partners intend to do so through parliamentary means.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has requested legal advice from the Attorney General on whether ratification of the EU reform treaty will require an amendment to the Constitution.  This is a legal formality that is observed on each occasion that an EU treaty comes for ratification.As on previous occasions, a referendum commission will be created to inform the public about the treaty and to encourage citizens to exercise their right to vote.  As was the case with the previous EU referendum in 2002, the referendum commission will be properly resourced so as to enable it to carry out its role in an effective manner.  I have already had a meeting with the Minister for Finance on financing for the commission.The Government will also undertake an information campaign to explain the contents of the treaty and its benefits to Ireland.  This is a challenging task given the inevitably complex character of the reform treaty.  Nonetheless, it will also be an important opportunity for us to have an informed and comprehensive debate about Ireland's place within the European Union.To this end, work is already under way on producing accessible material that explains the main elements of the treaty in plain language.  More detailed information on the treaty is already available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Public representatives have a special responsibility to promote constructive, well-informed public debate on issues of such national importance.  In that regard, I urge all Members of the Oireachtas to engage with the public on the treaty.The National Forum on Europe will also have an important role to play in promoting greater awareness of, and debate on, the reform treaty.  The forum has done an outstanding job since it was established.  We are the envy of many of our EU partners in having such a forum and I look forward to its work.  I also look forward to working with the Joint Committee on European Affairs and I have had some informal contact with the Chairman already.We have considerable experience of ratifying European treaties by referendum and our track record is good.  The first Nice referendum taught us the salutary lesson that there can be no room for complacency.  The House need have no concerns about complacency while I am in this role.  There is wide public appreciation of Europe's importance to Ireland and of the role that we play within the European Union.  The Irish public has been shown to be consistently among the most positive in Europe about the advantages of EU membership.Along with my colleagues in Government, I look forward to playing an active role in informing the public about this important treaty.  Colleagues from Fine Gael and the Labour Party have indicated they will be active.  I welcome the positive statements on the record of this House by Deputies Kenny and Gilmore.  I will write to all Members of the Oireachtas in the next few days providing details of the treaty.  I will be available to Deputies and Senators from all sides of the House and from all viewpoints, those in favour and those opposed, if further briefing or explanations are required.

This will be a vigorous, frank debate that we must carry to the people.  This treaty will free us from the introspection Europe has had for the past six years.  It will allow the 27 member states of the European Union to progress and serve all the people of Europe.  I hope the debate will be informed and honest and that the Irish people will, as they have done previously, vote "Yes" to Europe.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I welcome the interest of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in local economic and social development and the future of Partnership, Leader and other local companies.  As a board member of the Northside Partnership in Bunratty Drive, Coolock, Dublin 17, I was disappointed and taken aback with the changes in the guidelines on the governance of integrated local development companies and urban based partnerships lodged in the non-statutory list of regulations in the Oireachtas library last week.  This disappointment and unease is shared by other members and supporters of the Northside Partnership in the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies.Our key concerns relate to the changes to the board structures given the importance of boards to the administration of successful and fully accountable companies.  The cutback in the number of directors to be nominated by the national social partners to only two directors out of 20 in an urban company is a retrograde step, given the long-standing excellent support from local businesses and the trade union movement for the Northside Partnership and similar companies.Throughout its history of approximately two decades the Northside Partnership has been well served by a succession of volunteer directors from the north side business community who brought unique expertise and experience to the outstanding development of the company and its innovative programmes.  I am proud to recall that it was Peter Cassells, formerly general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who proposed the idea of partnership companies to the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in 1990.  Mr. Cassells and his trade union colleagues have always played an important role in promoting local development through partnership and other local community companies.For most of its history, Northside Partnership was expertly chaired by Mr. Padraig White, the distinguished former public servant and entrepreneur.  At present Mr. Willie Hamilton of Mandate Trade Union is efficiently carrying on Mr. White's great work for Coolock and the north side community.  The two three-year term limits proposed for directors seems ludicrous given the exemplary service and expertise of experienced volunteers to the progress of Northside Partnership and similar companies.  This restriction will impact most heavily on companies such as Northside Partnership where a dynamic chairperson is prepared to give freely of his or her time to develop projects which may take a decade or more to come to fruition.The banning of Oireachtas Members from service on the boards is also shortsighted and unnecessary.  Several Oireachtas Members like myself have been active prior to and throughout their political careers in support of local social and economic development.  On the Northside Partnership board I admired the service given over recent years by former Senator Derek McDowell and Deputy Seán Haughey, now a Minister of State.  It is reasonable to require Ministers to resign from boards but why disbar an ordinary Oireachtas Member who wishes to serve as a volunteer?These and other board changes were not necessary for the Northside Partnership and the vast bulk of other local development companies.  I understand some of the motives which informed the Minister's decisions.  Northside Partnership has always followed the highest company and accountancy standards under our highly impressive CEO, Ms Marion Vickers, and her outstanding staff.  Northside Partnership pioneered a wide range of seminal small business start-up, training and employment programmes including the local employment service, the challenger, life and other learning programmes, the local business network, the enterprise and employment development programme and the child care bureau.I understand the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Department setting out model corporate governance guidelines for local development companies.  However, in this and in his earlier guidelines on social economy companies, the Minister also caused grief.  He threatens to eviscerate the dynamic and progressive character of local development bodies.  Experience in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Germany and elsewhere has shown that these companies need to have an efficient commercial as well as social development structure.  The result of the Minister's bureaucratic approach will be to reduce these bodies to mere aspirational talking shops.The Minister appears to be a determined opponent of true co-operative entrepreneurial structures in urban areas and I urge him to strongly reflect on the history of Northside Partnership and similar local bodies, such as those in Connemara, before these non-statutory guidelines are finalised.  Is he prepared to refer the guidelines to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  He made a good case.  I will outline what we set out to do.  I will not stick to the script because it has been circulated and Deputies can read it for themselves.  Sometimes this House becomes a script-reading game where we do not engage with the issues raised.The partnerships were originally established in selected areas under an EU programme.  When I arrived in the Department they were of all shapes and sizes and had duplication.  I remember once being asked to go to Howth which is not a thousand miles from Deputy Broughan's constituency.  I was sceptical because I knew Sutton and Howth well.  However, Howth village had quite an amount of deprivation but the partnership did not cover it.  It was brought to my attention that extraordinarily, the Beara Peninsula and Sheep's Head Peninsula were not covered by partnership.If one considers this rationally one sees we have community development projects which focus on small areas and special groups.  However, people are at a disadvantage virtually everywhere in the country.  I believed a community development company should cover every citizen who needs a service.  This means it would not be intensively active in well-developed areas.  However, irrespective of where an individual is he or she would be entitled to a service.It is a reasonable proposition that if the State wants to deliver items such as the community services programme and the rural social scheme it should be structurally recognised that they be delivered through existing partnerships rather than by new and an increased number of corporate structures.  This would strengthen the role of partnerships within communities.  As I wanted contiguous borders and one company with a high standing in each area, I wanted amalgamation between Leader companies in rural areas while in urban areas it was more important to extend coverage.  The point was often made that a board was chosen unfairly.  I stated I did not care who was on the boards but I wanted selecting them to be fair and transparent and then let them get on with the job.  These were my guiding principles.As the Government rolls out new community programmes of universal application in a city or a rural area we should use existing machinery.  This was the basis for what we did.  We then got into the nitty-gritty where problems always arise.  Some people wanted me to be extremely prescriptive while others did not.  We had long debates and Departments such as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were involved.  Some wanted small boards and others wanted large boards.  I wanted to be as flexible as possible.  However, we had to lay down a few basic principles.It was laid down that every board had to have public representatives and we chose councillors.  I will return to the issue involving Deputies.  It was also laid down that statutory agencies and the county manager had to be represented because the local authority is key.  Social partners, namely, employers, trade unions and farming organisations in rural areas, also had to be represented and the community and voluntary sector had to be well-represented.  It had to be split between geographic representation and representation of special interests such as disabilities, Travellers and lone parents.  If we included everything and let everyone have what they wanted the board would have had 40 or 50 members but this was the next issue.A great deal of discussion and debate took place.  Eventually, I stated a certain number of statutory agencies would have to be represented but I would not predetermine them and the boards could choose them.  Local elected people had to be included but companies were not keen on this as they had not had them in the past.  After extensive negotiations, I went to Government but further issues were raised.  I held a meeting with Comhairle LEADER na hÉireann, PLANET, which is the network, and my office’s community partnership network.  I told the attendees they had several months to discuss these boards, on which the Northside Partnership was well-represented, and asked them what they wanted me to change.  They asked for additional representatives from local, community and voluntary interests and sought to be allowed to nominate the chairperson.  In anticipation of those requests, I received governmental agreement that morning.  That is all they wanted, so I signed off on the matter.  I am more than willing to debate this at committee but we have to move on with the job.As someone who has defended the right of Deputies to be local representatives as well as legislators, I have sympathy with Deputy Broughan's point regarding the Dáil.  I am open to bringing forward protocols to address the issue so that Deputies are not cut out from information or participation in the boards.  I may be wrong, but I understand Deputies are open to election as community representatives.  I will reflect on the point raised by the Deputy.  It was always my intention to devise a means by which Deputies could be involved in the process or, as has happened in the case of some partnerships in the past, avoid being cut out despite having voted money to the groups.We are channelling more than €200 million annually through these structures.  I have to ensure strong financial control because my Secretary General and I answer to this House for the money.  Rather than oppressive financial controls, I want to establish a system that can stand up to the rigours of good accountancy, which has been a concern in the past.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Over the past several years, Deputies from all parties have expressed concerns about the importation of Brazilian beef into the EU.  I have heard the issue being raised by Members from all sides of the House.  The rules and regulations applicable to Brazilian beef are inadequate in comparison to EU-originated products.  There is a complete absence of individual traceability and growth hormones are freely used.  Early last year, the IFA travelled to Brazil, where they produced a video on what they encountered.  Although it was rubbished in some quarters, the latest reports vindicate many of its claims.  In addition, Brazil uses vaccination to counteract the problem of foot and mouth disease.The long awaited Food and Veterinary Office report was published yesterday.  The report is disturbing because the number of animals on two out of nine holdings visited did not match the number on the database, highlighting a lack of routine checks to verify cattle numbers and individual identification.  More animals were listed on the database than were present on the farm.  The quality of the ear tags used was inadequate, individual tags were illegible in many instances and a high percentage were missing or lost.  As a consequence, the reliability of the 90-day residency policy used by the EU to implement regionalisation is totally undermined.  In one meat plant an animal was declared ineligible for the EU, yet its meat formed part of a consignment destined to the Community.  That is a serious breach of procedures.The report also found shortcomings in the vaccination procedure and stated that no routine controls had been carried out by competent authorities on holdings in some states to ensure proper vaccination.  The consequence of this exposure is herd immunity might not be sufficient to protect against foot and mouth disease.  It was observed that the foot and mouth virus continues to circulate in parts of the Matto Grasso.  The Food and Veterinary Office noted the absence of a programme to monitor the efficiency of the vaccination in 2007, which jeopardises the future certification of beef.  The report confirms all the concerns which have been expressed by the IFA, ICMSA and health and safety experts.  The matter is ongoing because agents of the office are still in Brazil and will produce further reports.News broke this morning of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Commissioner Kyprianou's home country of Cyprus.  We are told that the strain of the virus in Cyprus is the same as that found in Britain earlier this year, as well as the prevalent strain in Brazil.Questions arise in respect of the support of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the importation of Brazilian beef, which is opposed by most people in the industry other than the barons who want to make a killing from it.  Everybody who genuinely has this country's interests at heart opposes importing the beef.  How long can the Minister continue to support the importation of beef which is finding its way into our food chain without being displayed as Brazilian?  One can buy beef in any hotel or restaurant without knowing its origin.  From a health and safety perspective and because of the irregularities in implementing the regulations, which are already uneven, I urge the Minister to oppose the importation of Brazilian beef into the EU.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	377	On the origin of beef sold in hotels and restaurants, customers are entitled to ask why country of origin information is not on the menu.  If more consumers asked that question, the situation would improve.  We all need to play our part in that regard. The conditions for trade in animal products with third countries follow the principles established under agreements of the World Trade Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health.  The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its food and veterinary office, to monitor the compliance of third countries it has approved for trade with the EU.  This approval is on the basis that the Commission considers the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection of human and animal health to those operated within the community.  Where there are risks to public or to animal health in the community, arising from disease outbreaks in approved third countries, safeguard measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated.The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, welcomed the publication by the European Commission of the report of the food and veterinary office mission to Brazil.  The Minister said that this report will be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence.  She added that she was calling for a discussion on the report within the standing committee on the food chain and animal health.  The Minister also noted that a further food and veterinary office mission is taking place this month.  She said that Commissioner Kyprianou, who is responsible for health and consumer protection, has personally assured her that he will not hesitate to take appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country represents a risk to the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants.Following from its mission to Brazil this month it is vital that the food and veterinary reports on its findings at the earliest possible date and that the European Commission will take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of EU consumers and producers.  The Minister has consistently pointed out to the Commission and to her colleagues in the Council of Ministers that produce imported from third countries must meet standards that are equivalent to those required of community producers.  In this context she has been in regular contact with Commissioner Kyprianou.  The Commissioner has assured her that the Commission will not hesitate to take action if a product imported from a third country represents a risk for EU consumers, livestock or plants.I note the Deputy's concern regarding the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Cyprus.  The controls, based on EU regulations, which were applied in the case of the UK outbreak, confined the disease to a limited area.  Similar measures have been adopted for Cyprus and it is hoped that the outbreak will be restricted and controlled.  The Commission and the Cypriot Government are awaiting typing test results from the World Reference Laboratory to identify the specific strain of Type O virus involved in the outbreak in Cyprus.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I raised this issue previously on the Adjournment a number of years ago and raised it in various Dáil questions, yet the school concerned, Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra, Dublin 7, is still in prefabs today.  Since my words made no difference or impact on the Minister, her Department or the Government, I will read a letter from the teaching staff of the school, which I hope will help to force some action on the issue.  The letter, which was sent to their local elected representatives, reads:A chara,We are writing to you as a united team to ask you to highlight the case of our school which is now, unbelievably, in its 12th year in prefabs.  Gaelscoil Bharra was founded in Cabra in 1996, has over 220 pupils and has been a resounding success.I can certainly verify that.  The letter continues:However, 12 years after opening, we are no nearer to securing a permanent building for our children.  We have absolutely no faith in the Department of Education and Science, whose actions since 1996 have been pathetic.  The prefabs are dangerously over crowded and the Department is in breach of its own guidelines regarding classroom space, play areas, safety and so on.We have continually campaigned for a school building, canvassed our local representatives since 1996 and the school has been highlighted in the national media.  It is an absolute scandal that despite all the talk, nothing has happened.  We continue to educate the children to the highest standards, as evidenced by recent inspections, yet the Department is failing miserably to provide decent facilities.  We are exasperated, very angry and frustrated.  We are now in consultation with our union and are even considering industrial action, as nothing else has made any difference.We ask you to highlight our plight and to raise the issue with the Minister for Education and Science.Is muidne, múinteoirí Gaelscoil Bharra.Dar ndóigh, sheoladar an litir sin chugam i nGaeilge chomh maith.  Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go bhfuil sé dochreidthe — ní thuigim é — go bhfuil a leithéid ag teacht ó Rialtas a deireann go dtugann sé tacaíocht don Ghaeilge.  Cuirfidh mé mar seo é — tá réabhlóid cultúrtha ar siúl i gceantair lucht oibre i gCabra i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Tá obair iontach á dhéanamh ag an bpobal sa cheantar sin.  Tá imeachtaí gaelscoile, naíonra, club Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, Glór na nGael, feachtas frithdrugaí, ranganna Gaeilge, ciorcail comhrá, ranganna ceoil agus go leor eile ar siúl ann.  Nuair a chuireann muintir na háite iarratais isteach go dtí an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ag lorg cabhrach, níl an Roinn sásta an cabhair sin a thabhairt dóibh.Today there was a special Dáil debate on the Government's support for the Irish language.  Here we have a test case for that support and the Government has failed miserably.  As far as I am aware, the problem is simple enough.  There is an available site beside the existing school prefabs and all that is required is that an acceptable leasing arrangement be made with St. Finbar's GAA club, which has the site on a long-term lease from Dublin City Council.  I trust that whatever difficulties exist will be clearly identified in the Minister's reply, with a timescale within which the issues will be resolved and progress made.A week before the last two general elections, the Taoiseach, in whose constituency the school is located, circulated a letter to every resident in Cabra from the Minister for Education and Science stating categorically that, between himself and the Minister, they would sort out the issue, but nothing has happened in the six months since the last general election, nor indeed in the five years since the previous election.  If the Taoiseach had approached me for support, as he approached Deputy Finian McGrath after the recent election, this school would have been top of my agenda and the problems there would have been sorted out by now.

Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.In 2006, more than €500 million was invested in schools infrastructure and this funded the delivery of in excess of 1,300 building projects.  This compares with just more than €90 million provided for school buildings in 1997.  Under the national development plan, €4.5 billion is being invested to improve existing school buildings and provide additional accommodation for an expected growth of 100,000 in the schoolgoing population in the coming years.  Together with the improvements in planning that have been put in place, and those that are provided for in the new programme for Government, this will enable the Department of Education and Science to meet the needs of developing areas into the future.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to this sector.Turning to the specific matter in hand, Gaelscoil Bharra NS is a coeducational all-Irish national school.  The school had a September 2006 enrolment of 218 pupils and the enrolments in the school have been on an upward trend of 12% in the past five years.  The school has a current staffing of principal plus eight mainstream teachers and one permanent learning support teacher.  I can confirm that the Department has an application from Gaelscoil Bharra for a new school building.  Officials in the school planning section are considering a number of options for the long-term solution to the school's accommodation difficulties.  One of these options is the building of a permanent structure on the school's current site.  A number of issues have arisen with this proposal.  However, it will be pursued in tandem with a number of other options being considered by the Department.  The Department acknowledges the need for a solution to the school's accommodation difficulties and is committed to working to achieve a satisfactory solution as soon as possible.Once again I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on this school project and to highlight the enormous work being undertaken by the Department in implementing the school building and modernisation programme to ensure infrastructure of the highest standard is available for all our schoolgoing population.

The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Gardaí as required. Requests for aid to the civil power are normally made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector.At present, the Defence Forces assist the Gardaí as required in duties, which include the provision of troops for cash escorts, prison escorts, hospital guards for high-risk prisoners and the provision of military guards at a number of vital installations. The Air Corps supports An Garda Síochána in the operation of two helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft which form the Garda Air Support Unit. The role of the Naval Service in the provision of aid to the Civil Power is primarily exercised through the Joint Task Force on Drugs. The Task Force enhances co-operation between An Garda Síochána, Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service in enforcing the law in relation to drug trafficking.The military authorities have not received a specific request for assistance from An Garda Síochána in relation to armed crime.

The Minister's address was relevant, positive and informative and discussed topics of interest to the military delegates, their colleagues and to the wider community. Those topics included the Government's commitment to the continued development and modernisation of the Defence Forces as set out in the agreed Programme for Government, the Defence Forces continued participation in international peacekeeping, the continued investment in infrastructure and equipment, recruitment and   promotional opportunities.The Deputies interest in the Minister's speech is appreciated and it can be accessed from the Department of Defence website — www.defence.ie.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to promote the Irish horse abroad through participation in international competitions. The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years and, through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.The Army Equitation School has in place a Horse Purchase Board consisting of the Officer Commanding the Equitation School, an official from the Department of Defence, the second Officer Commanding Equitation school and Col. E.V. Campion (Rtd.). The Equitation School actively encourages breeders and producers who feel that they have a suitable horse to contact the School to arrange for inspection and assessment with a view to purchase or lease.In 2004, the Army Equitation School had 14 International wins at competitions throughout Europe, with 13 International wins in 2005 and a further 10 in 2006, including wins at Barcelona, Athens, Copenhagen and Zagreb. The Army Equitation School has had considerable success in 2007, notably Commandant Gerry Flynn's wins on Mo Chroí in the Dublin Grand Prix, the Lisbon Grand Prix, the Drammen Grand Prix and the Vimeiro Grand Prix.  Captain Shane Carey holds this year's record for selection on the greatest number of Nations Cup teams — during 2007 he attended eight Nations Cup shows in total.  It has recently been announced that Ireland's show jumping team will be promoted to the elite Samsung Super League in 2008, which is reserved for the best eight teams in the world.  It has been recognised that Commandant Flynn's and Captain Carey's significant achievements in 2007 have assisted the Irish team in gaining re-entry to this league.  Moreover, the success of the School over recent years is testament to the quality of the riders and of the horses at the School.The Army Equitation School continues to source high quality horses for competition at home and abroad and the Minister intends to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses will continue to be acquired by the school  in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 46 together.Currently, there are eight non-Irish nationals serving in the Reserve Defence Force, equating to approximately point one percent ( .1%) of strength.The number of non-Irish nationals who have applied for enlistment in the Reserve Defence Force during the past three years is fifty-four (54).There has been a significant broadening of cultural and ethnic diversity in Ireland in recent years. It is the Minister's policy that the Defence Forces should be reflective of this diversity. The Defence Forces have clear strategies on equality that will ensure that cultural and ethnic diversity is respected and supported.The Minister has asked the Chief of Staff to review recruitment into the Defence Forces at all levels and to implement changes that would facilitate recruitment from among cultural and ethnic minorities. I share the view that this can only enhance our Defence Forces.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 31 together.The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.In 2006 the Naval Service achieved an output of 1,658 patrol days, of which over 90% related to fishery protection.  In the course of these patrols, a total of 1,897 vessels were boarded, 19 were detained and 148 warnings were issued.  These outputs reveal a focused and committed Naval Service that is continuing to produce high levels of performance.The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that, when fully implemented, all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment followed by a ship-based appointment.  While every effort is made to ensure that the two year rotation target is met, there are occasions when as a result of shortages of key skilled personnel it is necessary for personnel to carry out ship-based duties more frequently.The impact of seagoing is well understood by Naval Personnel at all levels and the Naval Service endeavours to operate a planned approach to the sea/shore rotation of personnel.Following on from the report A Voyage of Discovery, a Naval Service/PDFORRA working group was set up and has made a number of recommendations.  As a result, a new patrol duty pattern has recently been introduced and work is also ongoing on examining solutions to shortages of skilled personnel in critical areas. Other recommendations from the Working Group are currently being considered.It goes without saying that members of the Naval Service have to go to sea. At the same time both the Department and the Minister are committed to ensuring that the Naval Service and the Defence Forces as a whole provides a challenging and rewarding career and a supportive working environment.

The claim has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and the Representative Associations. The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the C&A scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time other than to say that the claim will of course have to meet the terms of the Social Partnership Agreement — Towards 2016.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 163 and 164 together.The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 30 September 2007, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities was 10,361. This comprises 8,444 in the Army, 849 in the Air Corps and 1,068 in the Naval Service. A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank and gender are in the form of a Tabular Statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is intended to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.To facilitate the Defence Forces in maintaining a strength of 10,500 the agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training, at any given time. The military authorities and the Department are considering the planning and resources necessary to meet this provision.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Female strength in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 468 at the end of 2001 to 558 at the end of September 2007. In percentage of overall strength, this equates with a rise from 4.38% to 5.39% in the same period. A detailed breakdown of the numbers of females serving in the Permanent Defence Force, at year end over the last six years, is presented in the form of a Tabular Statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.Nevertheless, the Minister remains anxious to explore all avenues for increasing the numbers of women joining the Defence Forces.In 2006, the Minister reduced the minimum height requirement from 5' 4" to 5' 2". This increases the potential recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% of female population.Earlier this year, the Minister received the report of a TNS/MRBI study that he had commissioned, titled "Retention and Recruitment of Women in The Defence Forces". This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action can be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining.  The question of retention was also studied.The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving females agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work.  In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70% — 80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer.The report is currently under active consideration within the Department and the challenges identified therein continue to be addressed.30 September, 2007Lt.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The White Paper on Defence 2000 and the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan (2002) set out the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) together with an Implementation Plan extending to 2009.The Implementation Plan is being rolled-out on a phased basis up to 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. a new organisation structure implemented with effect from October 2005, major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the RDF is now structured along similar lines to the PDF (3 Brigades and the RDF Training Centre).The introduction of the integrated element of the Reserve is being addressed in the current year on a pilot basis across all 3 Brigades.  The Director, Defence Forces Training, has issued a comprehensive range of syllabi providing for training of the Integrated Reserve.During the Pilot Integration Schemes personnel are not assigned to the Integrated Reserve but are attached to their affiliated PDF unit for training purposes.  A total of 180 personnel have completed the training to date.  This comprises 41 personnel in 2 Eastern Brigade, 67 in 1 Southern Brigade, and 72 in 4 Western Brigade.  Personnel complete a minimum of twenty-one days full time training.While the numbers participating in the Integrated Reserve have been less than anticipated, I am satisfied that the pilot schemes mark a very significant step forward in implementing the Plan.The outcome of the pilot schemes is currently being reviewed by the military authorities.  This will provide the necessary information to plan for the future development of the Integrated Reserve.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	392	As part of the Modernisation Agenda agreed under Sustaining Progress a review of the provision of Medical Services in the Defence Forces has been ongoing.   This review, involving the Representative Associations, has dealt with, among other things, the level of service to be provided to members of the Defence Forces and the resources required for the delivery of that service.The review which has been carried forward into the modernisation agenda agreed under the Towards 2016 Partnership Agreement has already delivered an agreed medical services patients charter. Work on developing a revised structure for the delivery of medical services for the Defence Forces is ongoing.The key issue at this time is the acknowledged shortage of medical officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps. Whereas the establishment for doctors provided for in the new organisation of the Defence Forces introduced on foot of the White Paper on Defence is forty seven (47), the current strength of Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces is twenty three (23), one of whom is on leave of absence without pay. There has been recruitment of Medical Officers each year but the number attracted to work in Defence Forces has just served to address natural wastage.The problems with recruitment of medical officers into the Defence Forces have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of the Department and the Defence Forces to address the root causes. The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were increased substantially recently, in consultation with the Minister for Finance. This linked their pay to public health doctors and dentists. In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign. The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing. Currently civilian General Practitioners are regularly engaged to provide primary care where Medical officers are not available.The development of the capacity of the Medical Corps also forms part of the agreed programme for Government. I am committed to providing a medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad and I am currently reviewing progress on this issue to ensure that our commitments under the Programme for Government and the Towards 2016 modernisation agenda are met.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 42 and 51 together.In relation to the commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising in 2008, a meeting of the relevant Inter-Departmental Committee will be held later this month to consider the appropriate arrangements that should be put in place for this commemoration.  It is expected that the arrangements will be broadly similar to those put in place in 2007 and that the Committee should be able to finalise its recommendations by the end of the year.When the Inter-Departmental Committee has finalised its recommendations, it is proposed to re-establish the All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group and to convene a meeting of the Group to brief them on those recommendations and to take on board any views that they may have in relation to them.  Prior to that, the Minister for Defence will write to Party Leaders to ask them to nominate spokespersons to the Group.With regard to the preparations for the centenary commemoration in 2016 and in the lead-up to that year, it is the Government's intention that the centenary commemoration programme, at national, regional and local level, would include a wide range of commemorative, cultural and artistic initiatives.  Where appropriate, the commemoration programme could include an agreed social objective. It is the Minister's intention that this matter would be considered by the Consultation Group at its first meeting.In the previous Dáil, the Group had agreed to the setting up of an Expert Working Group that would provide specialist and academic advice in relation to the historical events and appropriate commemoration initiatives.  It is anticipated that the Group will wish, generally, to continue with this approach.The first meeting of the Consultation Group is expected to take place early in 2008.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The strength of the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) as a percentage of it's establishment is in the region of 90%.  The strength is sufficient to meet anticipated operational requirements. The ARW actively pursues a policy of recruitment to maintain strength levels and the delivery of required military capabilities.The unit recruits from all services with a continuous advertising campaign by means of:—Road shows and seminars in Brigades/Corps, Naval Service and Air Corps conducted by ARW personnel;Advertising in the Defence Forces Connect magazine and An Cosantoir journal.Induction is by ARW selection courses run on an annual and bi-annual basis as required. Interest from Permanent Defence Force (PDF) personnel in joining the ARW remains at a very high level. All serving members of the PDF are entitled to apply, provided they are medically fit and have attained the rank of at least 3 Star Private (or equivalent). Successful passing of the selection course demands the highest levels of fitness, motivation and competency.There is a continuous review of criteria for entry. However, it is critical that the high standards required for entry into the ARW are maintained in order to deliver the strategic capabilities and specialized response required by the Government.

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders which are assessed on the basis of obtaining best value for money by the Department of Defence.  The acquisition of the UAVs, scheduled for delivery by the end of this year, and the acquisition of helmets from companies in Israel followed on from such tender competitions.I am advised that the UAV systems are required to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance and target acquisition for overseas Peace Support Operations. They will provide a low cost and low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions without requiring or risking the use of manned aircraft. The UAV's, are an information gathering asset and are unarmed.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	398	While the recruitment of Civil Defence members is a local authority function, the Civil Defence Board both encourages and supports local authorities (through their Civil Defence Officers) to undertake recruitment campaigns.  These local recruitment campaigns are targeted towards the Autumn, to coincide with the commencement of the training year. The Board supports these recruitment initiatives through the provision of additional publicity material and media training for Civil Defence Officers which helps to enhance the image of the Civil Defence organisation at local level.In the Civil Defence Board's Strategic Plan, which covers the period 2007-2010, and which was launched by the Minister for Defence, Mr. Willie O'Dea, T.D., in September of this year, the Board identified the recruitment of new members as one of their main strategic objectives for the organisation.  The Board will strive to meet that objective by using the following strategies:Development of a strategic approach to recruitmentMarketing of Civil Defence as a multi-disciplined national emergency response agencyEncouragement of Local Authorities to become more proactive in developing Civil Defence within each local authority areaPresent indications are very positive, with some counties reporting significant increases in new membership this year.  The Civil Defence Board proposes to continue its support for local recruitment initiatives for the duration of the Strategic Plan.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 52 together.The question of the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one.  Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of foreign-nationals to the Defence Forces.As the Defence Forces do not categorise personnel by nationality there are no figures available of the numbers of foreign-nationals employed in the Defence Forces.  However the system is currently being reviewed to ensure that this data can be captured in the future.I know that people from diverse backgrounds have already been employed in the Defence Forces, but this has mainly been in certain specialised areas.  This has worked well — albeit on a limited scale.  Currently the emphasis of the Minister is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces.Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.  All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.The Cadet Competition is the entry level for recruitment as an Officer of the Defence Forces.  As you are aware, the Minister has made changes to the Cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.The Minister has asked the Chief of Staff to review recruitment into the Defence Forces at all levels and to implement changes that would facilitate recruitment from among cultural and ethnic minorities.  I share the view that this can only enhance our Defence Forces.The Military Authorities are equally committed to increasing the participation of people from ethnic and cultural communities in the Defence Forces.  To achieve this, the Defence Forces are:Developing a strategy for Cultural Diversity Management.  A new Defence Forces advertising campaign will be launched to reflect its strategy for cultural diversity.Establishing links with all ethical and cultural community groups based in Ireland, in order to brief the groups on the Defence Forces and its current entry requirements. The groups will be invited to forward submissions to the Defence Forces on their views of service in the Defence Forces and to highlight any barriers they deem unfavourable to recruitment that may exist.There are generally more applicants for positions in the Defence Forces than places available.  The Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all suitably qualified candidates who wish to do so are given the opportunity to join the Defence Forces.  The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces.The appropriateness of foreign-nationals being allowed to join the Defence Forces and through membership of the Defence Forces earn citizenship has not been considered.  The granting of citizenship in any circumstances is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the first instance.

A proposal for a film on Connolly was received by the 1916 All-Party Oireachtas Group.  Minister O'Dea met with some of the proposers of the project, in his capacity as Chairman of the 1916 All-Party Oireachtas Group when they made a presentation on the film to him in October 2006.It is proposed to re-establish the All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group with a view to convening a meeting in early 2008.  Minister O'Dea will be writing to Party Leaders to ask them to nominate spokespersons to serve on this Group.In the previous Dáil, the Group had agreed to the setting up of an Expert Working Group that would provide specialist and academic advice in relation to the historical events and appropriate commemoration initiatives.  It is envisaged that the proposal to support the making of a film on James Connolly will be examined in this forum and recommendations will be made to the All Party Oireachtas Group for a final decision.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 158 together.Ireland is committed to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup which will be on standby from the 1st January-30th June 2008.  On the 26th April 2007, I issued a letter of Accession to all participating members of the Battlegroup to join the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).The Nordic Battlegroup Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is an agreement between the participants comprising the Nordic Battlegroup, namely Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, which sets out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the Nordic Battlegroup.  The Operational Headquarters MoU defines the aim, principles and responsibilities for cooperation with regard to the establishment and operation of the EU OHQ in Northwood for the command and control of the Nordic Battlegroup.As part of the initial familiarisation and training phase for the Nordic Battlegroup eleven (11) members of the Defence Forces are currently deployed to the Force Headquarters in Sweden and two (2) are currently deployed to the Operational Headquarters in the UK.Ireland's contribution to the Battlegroup will amount to 100 personnel involving an Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (E.O.D./I.E.D.D.) team with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the Operational and Force headquarters.  E.O.D. relates to normal type munitions whereas I.E.D.D. generally refers to devices devised by terrorist groups, such as car bombs etc.  This level of operational commitment will only arise should the Battlegroup be called on to undertake an operation.  The number of personnel involved operationally during the standby period, where the Battlegroup has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be of the order of 10 to 12 personnel.  The on-call personnel for the contingent will be based in Ireland during the Standby period.Ireland is committed in principle to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2011.  Very preliminary discussions have also been held regarding possible participation in the proposed Austrian/German Battlegroup in 2012.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	402	The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 provided for a strength of 10,500 for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising some 8425 personnel in the Army, 930 in the Air Corps and 1,140 in the Naval Service, these figures being commensurate with the defined roles of the three branches.The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces, which has been a key focus for me since my appointment to the Defence portfolio, has seen, and will continue to see, significant investment in the Air Corps, Naval Service and the Army.  Major equipment projects have involved substantial expenditure across all areas including trainer aircraft and helicopters for the Air Corps, new ships for the Naval Service and a total of 80 Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers for the Army.  In addition a new tender competition has recently being initiated to cover a ship replacement programme for the Naval Service for the next ten years.I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are well equipped for their day-to-day roles at home and overseas and that the proportion of resources allocated to the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is fair and well balanced across the three branches enabling them to fulfil their roles in an efficient and effective manner.In relation to the TNS MRBI report on recruitment and retention of women, it should be remembered that, on balance, the results of the research are very positive.  The report reveals that women serving in the Defence Forces have a positive attitude to their job with over 75% of respondents thinking that the Defence Forces is a good place to work and over 73% reporting that they enjoyed their job.There are challenges in the report that we are continuing to address.The Minister's commitment and that of the Chief of Staff to addressing issues around interpersonal contact is well known.  The TNSMRBI research underlines the importance of this commitment into the future.Work-life balance initiatives of term time and career breaks in addition to the statutory entitlements such as Parental Leave, Carer's Leave and Force Majeure Leave are available to all members of the Defence Forces.The Minister is also committed to ensuring that other developments that emerge in the areas of family friendly policies generally will be reviewed positively to determine if they can be accommodated to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.Recruitment campaigns continue to emphasise the role of women in the Defence Forces as recommended by the Report.  Focus groups  looking at perceived barriers to career development and advancement of women in the Defence Forces  have recently been set up.I am determined that we should build on the positive issues arising from the report while continuing to address the challenges identified.  The Defence Forces offers an interesting and challenging career to women as well as to men.  The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	403	As a result of the broad nature of the question I have focused on the process of handling applications for entry into the Permanent Defence Forces as I imagine this is the main area of concern to the Deputy.  I would be happy to supply material on other specific application material if requested.Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.The total number of applications received to date in 2007 for each of these entry streams was 3,862.  Of this figure 1,231 were for the Cadetship Competition, 2,130 for General Service Enlistment, 454 for the Apprenticeships Competitions and a further 47 were for Direct Entry Specialist Competitions.The Cadet Competition, which is the entry level for recruitment as an Officer of the Defence Forces is held on an annual basis.  The average processing time from closing date for applications to the issuing of offers of cadetship is six months.  It is not possible to speed up the processing time for this competition as the offers are dependent on Leaving Certificate and University results.  In order to facilitate candidates, it is also necessary to hold the initial preliminary interviews over the Easter School/University break and to hold the final assessment phase until after the completion of the Leaving Certificate Examinations at the end of June.General Service Recruitment applications are accepted on an ongoing basis.  Applications are held until vacancies exist in an Army Brigade, Naval Service or Air Corps.  The average processing time for applications from when vacancies exist is three months.Apprenticeship Competitions are held on a regular basis.  The average time from closing date for applications to issuing of offers to successful candidates is three months.The average processing time for applications for Direct Entry Competition is at present approximately three months.The processing of applications comprises a number of different components, including, in some instances psychometric tests, interviews, medical examination, physical fitness tests and security clearance.  The Defence Forces periodically review the processes to ensure that technology and work practices are kept up to date thereby ensuring that the processing of applications is done as efficiently as possible.

ONET is recognised by the Minister of Defence and the Military Authorities in Ireland as the official representative of such personnel.As an organization, ONET is wholly independent of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. Consequently, I am not in a position to answer the Deputy's question directly.  However, I have forwarded the question to ONET with a request that a response be provided directly to the Deputy.I fully support the excellent work of ONET.  In this regard, I would point out that a commitment to provide annual subventions to support and encourage the excellent work of the officially recognised veterans groups, ONET and IUNVA, is included in the agreed Programme for Government.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I would like to assure the House that any allegations of victimisation in the Defence Forces are treated with the utmost seriousness and there are extensive and robust complaints and grievance procedures processes in place to protect the rights of all Defence Forces personnel, including PDFORRA officials.In addition, on interpersonal relationships, the Defence Forces and the Department have taken a wide variety of initiatives and have devoted extensive resources to this issue, since Dr Eileen Doyle and the External Advisory Committee presented their original report "The Challenge of a Workplace" in March 2002.The ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Doyle report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and the Department since its publication.  I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through educational modules on interpersonal relationships which are now embedded in career courses for all ranks.The Minister's commitment and that of the Chief of Staff to addressing issues around interpersonal contact is well known.

The Review noted some areas where civilianisation of military posts had been successfully implemented in the past and recommended that further work be done in this area.  Subsequent to the publication of the Review, civilianisation was incorporated into the "Pay Agreement and Modernisation Agenda" agreed with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the context of the Towards 2016 Partnership Agreement.The matter will be progressed by the Department and the military authorities on the basis of the above developments and of the Programme for Government.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving the Gardaí, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observation capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.There is close co-operation between the civil authorities — Garda and Customs — and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.The Naval Service, An Garda Siochána, the Custom Services are represented on the National Maritime Security Committee, as is the Irish Coast Guard.  This Committee provides a forum for the agencies represented to share their information and experiences in relation to marine surveillance.I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance, in conjunction with the Gardaí, the Customs Service and the Coast Guard, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.

The exercise, which commenced on 21st October, will continue until the 12th November.The total number of Irish Defence Force personnel participating in the exercise is 93 and includes the Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD), HQ staff and exercise assessor personnel.The exercise is designed to test the interoperability and strategic movement of the NBG.  The first phase of the exercise was conducted in the South of Sweden and included combined tactical operations based on EU approved scenarios.The second part of the exercise involves a deployment by rail, sea and air to the North of Sweden and the subsequent conduct of tactical operations.  The deployment exercise is designed to practice the NBG in the procedures and skills that are required for a real life deployment.The Nordic Battlegroup consists of a combined total of approximately 2,610 personnel, depending on the components required.  The contributing nations in this Battlegroup are Sweden, Finland, Norway, Ireland and Estonia.  Sweden as the framework nation takes the lead role in the NBG formation and will contribute approximately 2,200 personnel. This includes the core of the unit, which consists of a light mechanised infantry battalion of some 1,500 soldiers.  The infantry battalion can be reinforced with support resources such as engineering, logistics, anti-aircraft, intelligence, transport helicopter, medical or mine clearance units.  Should the need arise, combat aircraft with an airbase unit or special forces can also be deployed.The approximate contribution of personnel from the other nations to the Battlegroup are — Finland, 150, Norway, 100, Ireland, 100 and Estonia, 60. At present there are no further exercises of this nature planned for the NBG.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The restrictions on the use of tax reliefs announced in Budget 2006 and provided for in Section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007, were introduced to ensure equity in the tax system. Income from the harvesting of forestry was listed as one of the specified reliefs that would be affected by the measures. Relief not used in one tax year can be carried over to subsequent tax years to be offset against future income.This restriction on the use of tax reliefs only applies in full to high income taxpayers earning over half a million Euro in a single tax year and on a sliding scale to those high income taxpayers earning between a quarter and half a million Euro a year.  While it is accepted that forestry investment is a long term investment, this measure was introduced to counteract the situation whereby some high income individuals were able reduce their taxable income to nil or close to nil through the use of tax reliefs.  The restriction will help, in the interests of equity, to increase the effective rate of tax paid by high income individuals towards a minimum 20%.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I take it the Deputy is referring to projects undertaken under the Town Renewal Scheme.   Developers of projects wishing to avail of the tax reliefs provided for under the Town Renewal Scheme must obtain a letter of certification from the relevant local authority stating that the development is consistent with the objectives of the Town Renewal Plan. This requirement is provided for in section 7 of the Town Renewal Act 2000 and the guidelines issued under the Act by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. These guidelines provide that local authorities in considering whether to issue such a letter of certification should apply the following criteria in respect of developments for which tax relief is being claimed:(i)the development has been completed,(ii)the development has been carried out in support of the objectives of the town renewal plan,(iii)the development complies with any specific conditions set out in the town renewal plan in relation to development in the area to which the plan relates or in relation to development in any part or parts of that area,(iv)the use or uses proposed for the building, structure or house are consistent with the uses for which the area in which the building, structure or house is located, has been declared to be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more sections of Chapter 10 or Chapter 11 of Part 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and(v)the design of the building or structure takes account of the nature and character of the area in which it is located and complies with any other design standards set out in the town renewal plan,Also all appropriate information as set out in the guidelines must be provided and the veracity of such information should be verified.  The certification guidelines are set out in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's website and can be accessed at http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentandHousing/ PlanningDevelopment/UrbanandVillageRenewal/ TownRenewalScheme/.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Section 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 deals with the treatment, for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes, of partnerships.  It provides that, in the case of a business partnership, chargeable gains accruing to the partners on the disposal of partnership assets are assessed and charged on them separately and not on the partnership itself.  In this case, the dissolution of a business partnerships might involve three forms of asset disposal, two of which incur a CGT liability.  An asset that was brought into a partnership by a particular partner and is subsequently taken back by that same partner is not considered a disposal for CGT purposes and, as such, no CGT liability arises.Where an asset was brought into a partnership by one partner and is subsequently disposed of to a different partner, the disposal is treated as a disposal from the partner who originally contributed the asset to the partner that subsequently receives the asset.  In this case, the partner who contributed the asset is liable to CGT on any gain in its value.  The third form of asset disposal which might arise on the dissolution of a business partnership relates to assets acquired by the partnership which are subsequently disposed of to its partners.  In this situation, the assets concerned are taxable and the liability to tax is apportioned according to the apportioning of the assets between the partners concerned.Relief from CGT is available for persons aged 55 or over who are retiring from farming where the assets being disposed of have been owned and used for ten years prior to disposal.  Relief in this case is available on assets up to the value of €750,000.  Where such assets are disposed of to a child of the individual, who undertakes to continue to run the business or farm, there is no limit to the value of assets that may be claimed under this relief.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future on matters relating to the establishment of the proposed Commission on Taxation including its membership and terms of reference.   The Commission will be specifically charged with considering and making recommendations on the following:examine the balance achieved between taxes collected on income, capital and spending and report on it;review all tax expenditures with a view to recommending the discontinuation of those that are unjustifiable on cost/benefit grounds;consider options for the future financing of local government;in the context of maintaining a strong economy, investigate fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment including the introduction of a carbon tax.Pending consideration by the Government of these proposals, I am not in a position to elaborate further on matters pertaining to the Commission.  In relation to the different tax treatment of  farmers and other self-employed vis-à-vis  PAYE workers,  the PAYE allowance was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.There have been changes since 1980 — the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis, for example.  However, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  Moreover, given that there can be significant timing advantages in the payment of tax for the self employed, the employee credit is still perceived as necessary to ensure a balance in the system.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Stamp duty is a significant source of revenue for the Exchequer, raising over €3.6bn in 2006. For the first nine months of 2007 stamp duty yield has exceeded €2.9bn.  This helps to fund public services and to broaden the tax base, while keeping the direct tax burden low thereby facilitating continued economic success.  Any change made to the stamp duty code would need to reflect this position.The stamp duty code provides for one set of bands and rates for all non-residential property.  Introducing special rates and thresholds specifically in respect of farmland would not only complicate what is a concise and simple tax, but would also lead to calls for special treatment from other interested sectors, thereby leading to a greater loss of Exchequer revenues and further complicating the non-residential stamp duty code.The stamp duty code already provides relief for farmers in a number of respects, including relief for young trained farmers; consanguinity relief, farm consolidation relief and family farm transfers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The Deputy's proposal is a form of re-introduction of rollover relief.  It was announced in the 2003 Budget that no rollover relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.As the Deputy will be aware, there is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The tax treatment of diversification aid payments to former sugar beet growers is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I am informed by the Commissioners that, based on the information available to them on the current proposals for the payment of such aid, the payments are regarded as income and will be subject to income tax.  The payments are not, therefore, regarded as a capital receipt and the issue of whether an asset disposal takes place does not affect their tax treatment.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I would draw to the Deputy's attention that the transfer of farmland can incur liability to tax under three separate headings, namely: stamp duty, capital gains tax (CGT) and capital acquisitions tax (CAT).  CGT is payable by the person disposing of the land while CAT and stamp duty are payable by the person receiving the land.  However, there are a number of generous reliefs and allowances to reduce the tax burden of farmers transferring farmland to the younger generation.In relation to CGT, where an asset is disposed of, the chargeable gain is taxable at 20%.  However, where a person is retiring from farming, there is a special relief in place to reduce the burden of CGT where the person is aged 55 or over and is disposing of land that has been owned and farmed for 10 years.  The Finance Act 2007 introduced a provision to extend the relief in certain circumstances where the farmland had been leased prior to disposal.  For disposals made on or after 2 April 2007, retirement relief applies where:the land is let for a period of no more than 15 years, andimmediately before the time the land was first let in that 15-year period, the land was owned and used by the individual for the purposes of farming for a period of not less than 10 years ending with the time the land was first let, andthe disposal is to a child of the individual making the disposal (which includes a child of a deceased child).Where the land is transferred to a child who will continue to farm the land for 6 years, there is no limit to the amount of relief that applies — otherwise, the relief is restricted to assets valued at up to €750,000.  A child in this case also includes the child of a deceased child.If the person covered by the Deputy's Question has been farming the land or had been farming the land prior to it being leased, she may qualify for retirement relief on the full value of the land being transferred.With regard to CAT, a farmer who receives farmland by way of gift or inheritance is liable to CAT at 20%.  However, qualifying farmers can avail of CAT Agricultural Relief which reduces liability to CAT by 90%.  In order to qualify for Agricultural Relief, 80% of a farmer's assets, after having received the gift, must consist of qualifying agricultural assets.  Although off-farm principal private residences are not considered agricultural assets for the purposes of the relief, the Finance Act 2007 provided that a farmer can off-set borrowings on an off-farm principal private residence against the property's value, for the purpose of the 80% test.In conjunction with CAT agricultural relief, the CAT code includes group thresholds, below which no CAT is liable.  The indexed group thresholds applying to a gift to a grand child for 2007 is €49,682 (Group B).  Any other gifts/inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.  In this respect, in the scenario outlined in the Deputy's Question, by utilising agricultural relief in conjunction with the group thresholds, each grandson could qualify for relief from CAT on farmland to the value of €496,824.In the case of stamp duty, this is liable on the conveyance of any property by the person receiving the property.  The transfer of farmland is liable to stamp duty at the rates applicable to non-residential property.  However, there is an exemption from stamp duty for qualified young trained farmers receiving farming assets who declare that they will remain in farming.  Farmers aged under 35 who have a specific agricultural qualification may apply for this relief.  The Finance Act 2007 made changes to the relief to provide that the Advanced Certificate in Agriculture is the new minimum education standard for the relief and the refund procedures were revised to enable young farmers who receive land to undertake agricultural training following the transfer of land and claim a refund of stamp duty after achieving the relevant qualification.From the details supplied with the Question, the two grandsons are of sufficient age to undertake agricultural training before or after receiving the land in question which would qualify for a stamp duty exemption or refund as necessary.  However, where they choose not to use the young trained farmer relief, they would qualify for consanguinity relief, which applies to transfers of land between certain blood relatives, such as between a parent and child.  This reduces the rate of stamp duty to one-half of the rate which would otherwise apply.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	420	A scheme of tax relief is available under section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for donations to approved bodies, including eligible charities.The list of approved bodies is set out in Schedule 26A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and includes eligible charities, schools, colleges and universities, bodies approved for education in the arts as well as a number of other specified organisations. Bodies such as libraries and community centres may also qualify by reason of being eligible charities.  To qualify for tax relief under the terms of the scheme, the minimum donation in any single year that must be made to any one eligible charity or approved body is €250. There is no maximum qualifying donation amount but:where there is an association between the donor and the eligible charity or approved body at the time the donation is made, the relief will be restricted to 10% of the total income of the individual for the relevant year of assessment; andan overall restriction applies to the use of tax relief schemes by certain high-income individuals, as introduced by Section 17 of the Finance Act 2006.The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations, which is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal rate, varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self assessment or a company.  For a PAYE donor, the relief is given on a "grossed up" basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor.  Donors give their PPSN information to the eligible charity or approved body.  The claim for refund is made by the charity/body and payment is made directly to them.In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief as part of his/her annual tax return and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.  A full list of all individual bodies approved for the purpose of the Donation Scheme as well as the terms and conditions of the scheme and the relevant forms are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.Finally, I would point out that a separate scheme of tax relief for donations to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects is available under section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. To be eligible for this relief, the project must be approved by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I assume the Deputy is referring to reliefs available under the inheritance tax code.For the purposes of capital acquisitions tax (gift and inheritance tax), the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold known as the "Group threshold".  There are three Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these Group thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index.The indexed Group thresholds for 2007 are as follows:Group A: €496,824. This applies to gifts and inheritances received by a child, a step-child and a foster child from a parent. Group A also applies in certain circumstances to inheritances received by a parent from a child and by a grand-child from a grand-parent.Group B: €49,682. This applies to gifts and inheritances received by brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces and grand-childrenGroup C: €24,841. This applies to gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary who does not come under Group A or B.Any other gifts and inheritances that might have been received by the beneficiary from within the same Group since 5 December 1991 are taken into account when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating tax. If the total value of all gifts and inheritances received by the beneficiary since this date from within the same Group does not exceed the Group threshold, no Gift or Inheritance Tax will apply. If the Group threshold is exceeded, then a 20% rate of gift/inheritance tax will apply on the excess only over the threshold figure.Apart from the tax-free Group thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code exempts certain gifts and inheritances completely from tax and also contains relieving provisions.   The following are the main exemptions from gift and inheritance tax:A gift or inheritance received from a spouse.A gift or inheritance received for public or charitable purposesA gift or inheritance of a dwelling house in certain circumstancesThe first €3,000 of all gifts taken from each disponer in any one calendar yearSeparately, where a gift or inheritance consists of agricultural or business property, the value of the agricultural or business property may be reduced by 90% for tax purposes provided certain conditions are met.I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the Deputy requires specific information on any of the exemptions or reliefs available in relation to gift and inheritance tax, he can contact the Revenue Commissioners Stamping District in Dublin Castle on 6475000 who will provide the information required.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The 2007 Pharmacy Act allows for the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in providing for the removal of this derogation was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable.The Pharmacy Act will be commenced in 3 stages.  The 1st Stage of the process has put in place the Council of the new Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the 2nd Stage will put in place a new Registration regime for pharmacists and pharmacies, including offences and powers of investigation and the 3rd Stage will deal with complaints, inquiries and discipline (Fitness to Practice Provisions).  A three stage process allows flexibility in implementation dates, given the complexity and number of new policies and procedures that the new PSI Council must have in place to accommodate each stage.In relation to the removal of the derogation, new policies and procedures must be in place before the second stage of implementation of the Act, including the removal of the derogation, can proceed.   The second stage of the implementation of the Act will deal with the new procedures for registration of pharmacists and pharmacy businesses under Part 4 of the Act, the conditions for conduct of a retail pharmacy business, including 3 years post-registration experience for supervising pharmacists, Part 7 of the Act on the investigation of alleged offences, breaches of codes or professional misconduct, regulations for supervision of the sale and supply of medicinal products and, in the interest of public safety, new conditions for registration of pharmacists in terms of forensic and linguistic competency.Once these new policies and procedures and the new regulatory regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses are put in place by the Council, it will be possible to revoke the 1962 Pharmacy Act and remove the derogation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	425	My Department has requested the HSE to provide an estimate of the percentage of the total medicine items dispensed under the various public drug payment schemes which are generic products.  Not all products are substitutable with generic alternatives.  Where a generic substitutable is available, my Department has been informed by the HSE that for 2006, the latest year available, the percentages of generic medicines used in relation to medicinal products that have a generic comparator, for reimbursed items, are as follows:GMS (medical card) Scheme — 58.7%Drug Payment Scheme — 57.6%Long Term Illness Scheme — 54.1%European Economic Area Scheme — 58.1%These percentages relate to non-proprietary products (branded and non-branded generics) which have generic alternatives, for each scheme. Because it deals with specific illnesses or conditions, the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme covers a more limited range of medicines than the other schemes.The 2006 Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) Agreement, negotiated by the HSE and my Department with the manufacturing sector, provides for significant reductions in the price of patent-expired proprietary medicines.  These reductions (20% in March this year and a further 15% in January 2009) will, on full implementation, largely remove the current premium paid for these products over many branded and non-branded generic equivalents.  Accordingly, a system of compulsory generic substitution in the pharmacy, as used in some other jurisdictions, would have significantly less benefit in the Irish community schemes than in other countries but could, given the relative size of the Irish market, have an adverse effect on continuity and security of supply for Irish patients.Generic drugs are widely available in the Irish market, particularly in the hospital sector. Use of a proprietary or a generic equivalent is a matter for the prescriber, in consultation with the patient.  One of the objectives of the IPHA agreement is to enhance the ability of patients to have a greater say in the prescribing process with a view to choosing, in consultation with the prescriber, the medicine that best meets their needs and delivers best value for money.

In order for a product to be reimbursable under the two schemes, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only by medical prescription and that it should not be advertised or promoted to the public.  Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public.Nicotine replacement therapies are available to medical card holders since April 2001 on foot of recommendations made by the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group and the Advisory Forum established to support the Task Force in the implementation of the strategy.  Evidence shows that lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking, spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco, and, in general, their health is worse.Therefore, it was considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit.  Accordingly, and in light of the recommendations that were made, it was decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders. There are no plans to extend this to the Drug Payment Scheme.

This document provides an important and strategic framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead.The vision for people with disabilities contained in this document is that of "an Ireland where people with disabilities are given the opportunity to live a full life with their families and as part of their local communities, free from discrimination".  To achieve this vision it is necessary for the Government and the various parties involved in the agreement to work together over the 10 year lifespan of the Agreement to achieve its long-term goals with a view to continuing the improvements in the quality of life of people with disabilities.A critical element of this process for my Department was the publication of its Sectoral Plan in July, 2006.  While the Sectoral Plan was developed as part of my Department's responsibilities under the Disability Act, 2005, it nevertheless links into the requirements of "Towards 2016" and  represents a commitment at all levels of the health service to access equity of service for people with disabilities.  The Sectoral Plan document is only the first of a series of plans that will work towards achieving this goal.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Sectoral Plan document is currently being reviewed by my Department, in consultation with stakeholders, and the revised document will be published shortly.  The Government's commitment to the ongoing implementation of the National Disability Strategy is restated as the focus for policy over the lifetime of the "Towards 2016" agreement.  The designation of a Minister of State with responsibility for Disabilities and Mental Health and the planned establishment of an Office for Disabilities and Mental health will facilitate cross departmental working in areas of mutual responsibility and concern.The new Minister of State for Disabilities and Mental Health has cross departmental responsibilities in the Departments of Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science and Justice, Equality, and Law Reform.  This cross departmental assignment is intended to reflect the Government's commitment to the mainstreaming agenda and to recognise that there are issues that are of particular relevance to people with disabilities which require a cross departmental response.  This appointment is also in line with the sentiments contained in "Towards 2016".

At present, such services are either availed of on an individual basis, without the involvement of the State, or are arranged in certain cases by the Health Service Executive.Any complaints in relation to the provision of such services should, in the first instance, be brought to the attention of the Executive, particularly in relation to any cases where abuse of any nature may be suspected.  However, I am not aware at present, either from the HSE or elsewhere, of large scale complaints from the public in regard to private home care provision.  If the Deputy can supply further information on this I would be prepared to follow up any specific issue he raises.I am conscious of the need to ensure high standards in the area of private home care.  I understand that the HSE is at present developing national guidelines for enhancing the delivery of home care services.  My Department will continue to liaise with the Executive to determine how improvements in this area might best be achieved.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	444	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  Correspondence has been received by my Office from this Group which will be responded to shortly.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1 July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.

These covered issues such as:the changes needed in NCHD work patterns;the need for a significant increase in the number of consultants;the need for a revised contract for medical consultants;reform of medical education and training;and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.Work is proceeding in relation to each of the main recommendations made in the Report.  The Report is helping to inform the Health Service Reform Programme.

When cocaine is taken with alcohol its combines  in the system to form the drug cocaethylene which is more toxic than using either drug alone.  The combined use of alcohol and cocaine has, I understand, been linked to violence which is particularly prevalent due to the increased aggressiveness associated with cocaine use and the dis-inhibition associated with alcohol use.I am aware that in Ireland some people who take cocaine also use alcohol at the same time.  The Health Research Board in its recent report Health Related Consequences of Problem Alcohol Use, noted an increase between 2004 and 2005 of 45% in the number of people being treated for both alcohol and cocaine use among those whose cases which were reported to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System.Some work of general relevance to the issue of combined use of cocaine and alcohol in Ireland is that being carried out in the context of the National Drug Related Deaths Index (NDRDI).  To comply with Action 67 of Building on Experience: National Drug Strategy 2001-2008, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform jointly asked the Health Research Board to establish a National Drug-Related Deaths Index.  The index is a census of drug and alcohol-related deaths and deaths among substance users in Ireland.  The data for the Index is drawn from a number of sources including the General Mortality Register; the Coroner's Service; the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE); and the Central Treatment List.The National Drug Related Death Index (NDRDI) is collecting information on all alcohol related deaths since 2004, in addition to all drug related deaths (including cocaine).  From this, the number of deaths in which both alcohol and cocaine are implicated may be calculated.  The first report from the NDRDI will be available in late 2008.

Information provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department indicates that as of 1 October 2007, 343,975 persons aged 70 or over held a medical card.  General Practitioners who hold a General Medical Services (GMS) contract with the HSE to provide services to medical card patients receive an annual capitation fee for each client according to a client's age, sex and the distance of their residence from the GP's centre of practice, regardless of the number of patient visits in the year.Data is collected by the Health Service Executive in relation to costs in the General Medical Services Scheme and in relation to medical card holders' usage of hospital services, including in-patient and accident & emergency services.  However, as this data does not capture information in relation to the basis on which a person qualified for a medical card, it would not enable an analysis of what effect the provision of medical cards to all persons over 70 may have had on usage of health services.

Applications for funding from the Health and Children National Lottery allocation are received from individuals, groups, and organisations with an involvement in the provision of health services to specific client groups and national groups providing information and support regarding disability and illness and groups with a specific interest.  No application for National Lottery funding has been received by my Department from the Asthma Society in 2007.The funding generally of voluntary organisations in the health area is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004.  As the Executive is the appropriate body to consider this aspect, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	450	An  tArd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with the statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland.  I have made enquiries with an tArd Chláraitheoir and the position is as set out below.The provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 concerning marriages were commenced on 5 November 2007.  From this date, there is a requirement that both parties to an intended marriage must give notification of intention to marry, in person, to a registrar (unless resident outside of the State or unable to attend in person by reason of ill health).  The purpose of the delivery of the notification in person is to allow the registrar to be satisfied as to the identity of the parties, the witnesses and the solemniser, as to their capacity to marry each other (ensuring that no impediments exist) and as to their freedom to marry (checking that any divorce or annulment granted to either party from a previous marriage is legally valid).Once the registrar is satisfied that the marriage may proceed, a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) is generated electronically from the computerised Civil Registration System (CRS) and given to the parties.  The MRF is essentially a licence to marry and is the basis of the registration of an entry in the register of marriages following the ceremony.  From 5 November 2007, no marriage is valid unless an MRF has been issued and is signed by the parties, the solemniser and the witnesses following the ceremony.When couples intend to give notice of intention to marry, they will contact the registrar's office and make an appointment to meet the registrar.  At the initial contact stage, the procedures and documentary requirements will be explained to the couple.  This will ensure that when they visit the registrar's office, they will have all necessary documentation with them and the notification can be made and the MRF issued at the same time.  This procedure gives the highest possible degree of assurance to the couple and the registrar that everything is in order and that the marriage can proceed as intended.The new procedures for notification of intended marriage and registration of marriage are completely computerised, using the most up to date technology available, and is the central component in administering the new marriage provisions.  The database also contains a register of solemnisers and locations for marriage, access to which is essential to completion of the marriage notification process.  The database is available to all registrars who are employed in this capacity by the HSE.However, within Co. Roscommon and in a number of other areas throughout the country, there are a small number of private registrars who are either not directly employed by the HSE or who perform registration duties outside of their whole-time duties with the HSE.  These registrars do not have access to the computerised system, for reasons of security and data protection.  In many cases they operate from a private residence and the safety and integrity of the system, (which contains almost all births, deaths and marriage records) would be exposed to unacceptable risks at these locations.The registrars in question continue to operate a paper-based registration system for births and deaths registrations and these entries are taken on to the computerised system when forwarded to the Superintendent Registrar for the area.  The practical and logistical difficulties in administering similar arrangements in the case of marriage notifications and the MRF were considered by the Registrar General and found to be impractical and unworkable.Unlike birth and death events, the MRF details are dynamic and subject to change between the time of notification and the date of the marriage.  Almost all details (such as the venue, the solemniser, the witnesses, etc.) may change and any and all changes must be reflected on the MRF.  Any delay in this process, between the time the registrar is notified of a change and the time that the amended MRF is issued, could potentially jeopardise the validity of a marriage and it was felt that the potential risks involved significantly outweigh any convenience in involving such registrars in the marriage process.Prior to the commencement of the new provisions, one or both of the parties to a marriage had to be resident in the district in which the marriage took place and notice of intention to marry had to be served to the registrar for that district.  The new provisions abolished these requirements and notification of intention to marry may be delivered in person to any registrar's office, irrespective of residence and the location of the venue for the proposed marriage.  These changes, far from centralising the service, mean that persons living in Co. Roscommon may deliver notification of intention to marry to a number of registrar's offices in the region, including Roscommon town, Longford, Carrick-On-Shannon, Sligo, Galway and Castlebar, or to any registrar's office in the State.Having consulted the Registrar General, I am satisfied that the new arrangements will not result in any significant inconvenience to local communities in Roscommon and are the most practical means of ensuring that the new provisions will operate effectively.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Discussions with staff on this matter are expected to commence shortly.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	455	At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the projects and programmes in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for development in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 and estimated the cost of implementing these at €34 billion, in current cost terms.The huge scale of the Transport 21 programme is such that adjustments to the timescale for individual projects is inevitable.  The value of the ten-year financial framework is that it gives us the flexibility to deal with this in an effective way.  However, the aim continues to be to complete the Transport 21 programme by the end of 2015.Most national road projects are now being completed on or  ahead of schedule.  All of the seven projects opened to date this year have been on or ahead of time.  These included the Newry-Dundalk motorway which was three months ahead of schedule, the Tyrellstown to Kilbeggan project which was six months ahead of schedule and Phase 1 of the Arklow-Gorey Bypass which opened four months early.  The five major inter-urban motorways are on schedule for completion by end 2010.  The new Docklands station opened in March this year, well ahead of its 2009 indicative target date.  Delivery of the 183 new Intercity railcars began earlier this year, on schedule, and the first of them will enter service in the coming weeks.Notwithstanding this excellent progress it has been necessary to revise the indicative completion dates for some projects because of circumstances arising before construction, details of which are listed below.  These necessary revisions have arisen for a range of reasons including changes to the scope of the projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties.The revisions are set out below for individual projects:Portlaoise Train depot will be completed in the first quarter of 2008, rather than at the end of 2007; this change arose because the planning approval process took longer than anticipated.Cork Commuter Rail Service to Midleton: The construction timetable is yet to be finalised with the contractors, but Iarnród Éireann is optimistic that passenger services will start in early 2009, rather than in 2008.Linking of the existing Luas lines: Dublin Bus expressed serious concerns about the impact the preferred Luas alignment would have on its services.  Dublin City Council is currently undertaking traffic modelling work as part of its examination of revised traffic management arrangements in the city centre, which will be required for the delivery of the Luas city centre link (line BX) and the further extension to Liffey Junction (line D).  Following completion of further detailed design work and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management modelling work, the RPA plans to submit a Railway Order application for Luas Line BX to An Bord Pleanála next year.The Tallaght to Citywest Luas timescale has been revised from 2008 to 2010 to accommodate a longer alignment than originally planned.The revised completion date for the Connolly to Docklands Luas is 2009, rather than late 2008 as originally scheduled mainly because the RPA devoted a substantial period to addressing and resolving the concerns of businesses in the IFSC about the impact of construction on their operations.Metro West: The projected completion date for the entire project remains 2014.There were tendering issues on Limerick Southern Ring Road project which meant that the contract award process did not progress as quickly as was originally hoped.  Completion is now scheduled for 2010. Construction starts on both the M3 and the N25 Waterford City Bypass were later than planned because of archaeological issues at Tara and Woodstown respectively.Dublin City Centre rail resignalling project was expanded to include the Maynooth line, resulting in a longer construction period and a 2011 completion date.Due to a slightly later than planned submission of the Railway Order application, Phase 1 of the Navan Line will now be completed in 2010.Metro North: The scheduled completion date is now 2013 to take account of scope changes made which arise from public consultation.In short it can be said an indicative timetable is just that — an indication of the timeline in which a project will be delivered some projects have been and will continue to be delivered ahead of the times indicated and some will be later than indicated, but the overall target is to ensure all are completed within the Transport 21 timeframe.

I also stated that it was essential that every effort be made to reinstate the Constitution, to lift restrictions on the media and the judiciary, and to return to the democratic process and early elections, in order to pave the way for a peaceful transition to democratic government in Pakistan.  Likewise, the widespread arrests and detentions of opposition members, human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers are also deeply disturbing.As was stated during the Adjournment Debate in Dáil Éireann on 6 November, the Government's position is clear.  While recognising that Pakistan faces threats to its peace and security, we are firmly of the view that stability and development can only be achieved through democracy and the rule of law.Along with our EU colleagues, we call on the Government of Pakistanfirst, to take urgent action to restore the Constitution;second, to ensure that the commitments which have been made — and restated on 5 November — that free and fair elections will be held on schedule in January are respected in full, and the necessary conditions to ensure this put in place;third, to release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, lawyers, journalists and human rights defenders.  In particular, I appeal for the immediate release of the distinguished human rights defender, and UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, whose detention is totally unacceptable;fourth, to honour the President's commitment to step down as Chief of Army Staff by 15 Novemberfifth, to pursue energetically reconciliation with the political opposition; andfinally, to relax restrictions on the media.I have conveyed these views and my deep concerns about recent developments to the Ambassador of Pakistan in Dublin, making clear my active and ongoing personal interest in the situation.  I and my EU colleagues will keep the situation under active review and I will seek to ensure that we have a detailed discussion on developments at the forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 November.

It is currently, however, under consideration having been placed on the table for discussion by the Portuguese Presidency.Ireland continues to adopt a constructive role in these discussions.  Some key outstanding issues include the review of restrictions and prohibitions that apply regarding the use of temporary agency workers and the duration of the "grace period" or qualifying period with regard to the principle of equal treatment.  Ireland and several other EU Member States have argued that a qualifying period of six weeks is far too short and that pay parity should only apply after a longer waiting period to be agreed in negotiation between the Member States.In this regard Ireland is seeking to obtain a balance between promoting more flexible forms of work organisation, thus allowing more opportunities for agency workers, while not undermining the employment rights of such workers.  Our aim is to better reconcile flexibility and job security and create more and better jobs which is a fundamental goal of the Lisbon Strategy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.In order to support the delivery of essential services, the ring fencing of health related, Drugs Task Force and child care places was introduced in 2002/2003.   As a result of this service provision levels continue to be maintained at a constant level.  In November 2004, following a review of FÁS employment schemes (Community Employment, Job Initiative and Social Economy Programmes), I announced that Community Employment places supporting the delivery of health services will continue to be ring-fenced.  However, in line with Government policy, there are currently no plans to mainstream these Community Employment places.CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.

The Programme started in 2000 and ends in 2007.  EQUAL has been delivered in two Rounds.  In total up to 75% of the costs of 21 projects were funded under Round 1 of the Programme and 22 projects under Round 2.EQUAL Ireland Development Partnership has received funding of €872,932 under Round 1 and EQUAL Ireland Life Long Learning (Workplace and Community) Project has been allocated funding of €1,075,140 and additional funding of €241,908 under Round 2 of the EQUAL Community Initiative.  While EQUAL projects are continuing to operate until the end of 2007, there is no further funding available from the European Social Fund for new projects or activity beyond 2007.  Commitments must have been entered into by the end of 2006 to be admissible for funding under the rules covering EQUAL.I would therefore suggest that the promoters of EQUAL Ireland engage with the relevant State Agencies, including those which have to date contributed to the costs of this project directly, to ascertain whether funds are available to continue with this project.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.The Management of the IDA property portfolio is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and is not one in which I have a function.  I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, at present, there are 67 IDA owned buildings of which 27 are unoccupied.  In addition, the Agency leases 83 units from private investors and 35 of these units are also vacant.  Details of the locations of these buildings are set out in the tabular statement below.In the ten-year period from 1998 to 2007, the percentage of IDA properties (both owned and leased by the Agency) that were vacant varied from year to year, while the total number of such properties fell from 613 in 1998 to 150 in 2007.  The actual number of properties vacant together with the percentage figure in respect of each of the years from 1998 to 2007 is shown in the tabular statement that follows.A policy decision to move away from involvement in buildings was implemented by the Agency in the late 1990s.  In divesting of buildings the Agency was conscious of the need to maximise the financial returns and to balance the disposal programme against the need to have buildings available in key locations for marketing to IDA and Enterprise Ireland clients.An Expenditure Review of IDA Ireland's Property Programme which was led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and was concluded in 2004 recommended that the Agency should continue with its policy of disengagement from buildings, taking into account the need for value for money.  Copies of the Expenditure Review, which have been placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas are available on the Department's website.Private FinanceIDA OwnedCountyTownOccupiedVacantTotalOccupiedVacantTotalCorkBallygallan000033CorkBantry404000CorkBandon000303CorkCharleville011101CorkLittle Island101000CorkKilbarry538000CorkMallow101000CorkWilton112000CorkSkibbereen303000DonegalLurganboy000808DonegalBallyshannon033000DonegalLetterkenny404000DublinBallyfermot000011DublinBallymount000101DublinClonshaugh000145DublinGardiner St00051318DublinTallaght101101DublinAirways5712000DublinPoppintree112000GalwayLoughrea000101GalwayMervue000202GalwayRoundstone000123GalwayBallinasloe011000GalwayBallybrit101000GalwayParkmore101000GalwayGort101000GalwayTuam145000KerryKillarney000415KildareNewbridge156000KilkennyFieldcrest000101Leitrim—000000Longford—000000Louth—000101MayoBallina101101MayoCharlestown000011MonaghanBallybay000101OffalyTullamore000101RoscommonCastlerea000101RoscommonMonksland Athlone213000RoscommonGallowstown101101SligoFinisklin000112Tipperary—000000WaterfordJohnstown167000WaterfordWaterford000314WestmeathAthlone213000WestmeathMullingar101000WexfordEnniscorthy213000WexfordWhitemills101000WicklowArklow606101483583402767YearTotal Number of BuildingTotal Number Vacant% of Properties Vacant199861311318%19993314915%2000305238%20012745922%20022516425%20032388134%20042229342%20051898746%20061556743%20071506241%
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent body which is bound to act judicially.  It was set up to provide individuals with a forum to seek remedies for infringements of their statutory employment rights.  I understand that the practice is that Tribunal members do not hear cases where a relationship exists between them and a party or witness to a case.If a member becomes aware that s/he is related or connected to a party or witness before the day of the hearing s/he asks to be replaced.  If, on the other hand, a member only becomes aware of such a relationship during a hearing then the member either discharges him/herself immediately from the hearing or, where that relationship is not close, discloses the nature of that relationship to the parties and is guided by their attitude as to whether or not s/he should continue to hear the case or discharge him/herself.In a case currently before the Tribunal some evidence was taken over two days in June 2007.  At that time a member of the Tribunal was not aware that s/he was related to a witness whom the respondent intended to call to give evidence later in the proceedings.   During the 2007 summer vacation that member became aware that a relationship through marriage existed between the member and the proposed witness.  For this reason and prior to the resumed hearing, which was scheduled to take place for two days in late October 2007, the Tribunal called the parties before it to inform them of the relationship and that the Division of the Tribunal was discharging itself from hearing that case.A new Tribunal Division is scheduled to hear this case beginning in January 2008.

The administrative team has been strengthened recently with the assignment of two additional posts.  As a result the National Archives now has a new Head of Administration post at Assistant Principal level and a new Assistant to the Director post at Executive Officer level.  I understand that some vacancies in professional grades are currently in the process of being filled.  My officials have recently met with the Senior Management of the National Archives and have asked for additional information on the staffing structures in the organisation to allow them  to explore options in relation to staff resources in the context of Government policy on staffing numbers in the public sector.The Reading Room of the National Archives in Bishop Street is open from 10.00 until 17.00 Monday to Friday and receives an average of 64 visits by members of the public each day.  The Management of the National Archives is keen to extend its opening hours but space and staffing levels temper the feasibility of doing this.  When additional space becomes available on the Ground Floor of the Bishop Street building management in the National Archives will review the feasibility of a limited extension of opening hours.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	465	In order to qualify for a contributory pension a person must satisfy a range of conditions which include commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum of 260 contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate of at least 10 contributions paid or credited.  An average of 48 contributions is needed for a full pension.The average contribution test is a key qualifying condition and aims to ensure that those receiving a pension have demonstrated an adequate and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system over their working lives.  Accordingly, the period from when a person first becomes insured until the end of the last contribution year before they reach pension age is used to assess the average contribution rate.  A concession in this regard was made to self-employed persons who became compulsorily insured on the 6 th April 1988 in that any previous PRSI record they may have can be disregarded, if that is to their advantage, when eligibility for pension is being assessed.The issue of gaps in a person's insurance record impacts on a number of different groups, not just the self-employed, and any changes being proposed would therefore have to be looked at in the context of the system as a whole.  These issues are discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions, which I published on the 17 th October, and changes to the system will be considered in the context of the framework for long-term pensions policy, which will be developed after the consultation process is completed.Eligibility to contribute to the system of social insurance is based on a person's income and employment status.  There is no legislative basis, and none is planned, under which retrospective contributions, which were not due in the first place, can be accepted.  It is, of course, open to those who fail to qualify for a contributory pension, or who qualify for a reduced payment, to apply for the means tested state pension (non-contributory).
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	466	In line with the recommendations of the Final Report of the National Pensions Board, Section 12 of The Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005) provides for amendments to the contribution conditions for the purposes of State contributory pensions.   In accordance with the legislation, from April 2002 the paid contributions requirement was standardised at 260 contributions, and this will increase to 520 contributions with effect from April 2012.  The planned contribution requirement has, for a number of years, been included in the Department's standard information material on pensions.The Department is at present assessing the likely impact of the change on those who will reach pension age in 2012.  The need for promotional work and other measures related to the planned change will be considered when this examination is complete.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	467	An employed contributor is broadly defined as a person over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age who is in insurable employment.  Insurable employment means employment in the State under any contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, whether expressed or implied.Employment contributions are calculated on employees reckonable earnings.  For the purposes of collecting employment contributions under the PAYE/PRSI system reckonable earnings means anything assessable to income tax under Schedule E of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This means that where an employee pays or is assessed for income tax they are simultaneously assessed for PRSI liability, and the appropriate deduction is made from their salary.Insured workers are required to pay PRSI contributions based on their level of income.  The vast majority of workers pay social insurance contributions at the PRSI Class A rate and accrue entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits.  Class A0 applies to all employees — including medical card holders and certain social welfare recipients who are normally employed under Class A but whose reckonable earnings are between €38 and €339 per week.  On this basis an employee working about 4.5 hours per week at the minimum wage is gaining a PRSI credit and subsequent entitlement to social insurance benefits.The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2005, found that, in almost all circumstances, working people receive very good value-for-money from the Social Insurance Fund, based on current benefit and contribution rates.  For this reason it is very much in the interests of the individual worker to ensure that their social insurance contribution records are maintained.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	468	It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions. In the case of contributory pensions this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate. The State pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system.A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension. This special pension covers some of the group aged between 60 and 65 referred to by the Deputy. To qualify, a person must have been age 56 or over on 6 April 1988, started paying social insurance contributions as a self-employed person on or after this date and have at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid on a compulsory basis since first starting to pay social insurance contributions as a self-employed person. The personal rate and increases for a qualified adult and a qualified child are paid at 50% of the standard maximum rate.The pension element of PRSI paid may be refunded in the case of contributors who entered insurable employment after they had attained the age of 56 and who have no entitlement to any State Pension.The arrangements introduced in 1999 are designed to give some recognition under the social welfare pensions system to a group of people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment, contributory or means tested. The pension was considered a reasonable response to the position this particular group of people found themselves in, and it represents very good value for the level of contributions paid. In my view, this remains the position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	469	A new pension scheme, known as State Pension (Non-Contributory) was introduced in September 2006 and incorporated all means-tested schemes for people aged 66 or over. As part of this reform, the basic income disregard for the purposes of the means test for non-contributory pensions was increased to €20 per week and a new disregard on earnings from employment of €100 per week was introduced to encourage pensioners who wished to continue in employment or to return to employment. Budget 2007 increased the basic means disregard to €30 per week in addition to increasing the earnings disregard to €200 per week.The earnings disregard of €200 per week does not apply to income from any other source such as self-employment including farming or rents from leasing property. Income from sources other than employment, including pensions and capital, is covered by the enhanced general means disregard of €30 per week.However, it should be noted that in contrast to persons in employment, expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out any form of self-employment have always been disregarded when calculating means from self-employment. This means that such earnings are assessed net of expenses incurred by the person in the course of their work e.g. on petrol/diesel, purchase of equipment and raw materials, etc. There are also special arrangements for farmers participating in the REPS and SACS schemes. The first €2,540 of all income from these schemes is not assessable for means test purposes and 50% of any balance is assessed. Expenses necessarily incurred in order to participate in these schemes are also disregarded.The effectiveness of means testing arrangements are kept under review and, where appropriate, changes are considered in a Budgetary context.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested. This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. The means test has been significantly eased over the years most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week. This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits. This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.In addition, the rates of carer's allowance have been increased to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.The introduction of a universal payment, albeit with a means tested supplement, would have substantial cost implications. The view of some support and health organisations is that it would be much more beneficial to carers if additional resources were invested in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.I will keep the supports for carers from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.

All rent supplement due up to the end of October has been paid.The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned was awarded a rent supplement from 20th September 2007 at a rate of €543.70 per month. It has further advised that the payment of €743.10 which issued to the person concerned on 26th October 2007 consisted of the rent supplement due for the eleven days from 20th September 2007 to 30th September 2007 and for the month of October 2007.

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a n umber of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. The payment was last increased in 1996.The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase. The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups. This approach was continue d in Budget 2007 with increases of up to €16 and €18 per week granted on personal rates.

This process is informed by the following guiding principles:improving on the ground servicesstreamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheadsbringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures;strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.The core objective of the process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and  alignment of local delivery structures.  The intention is that for the future there will be one local development company in any given area and fewer local development companies overall. This will provide full county coverage and eliminate overlaps and previous fragmented arrangements.Following exhaustive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development companies in March of this year.  Subsequent consultations with stakeholders culminated in a meeting with the representative networks of local development companies (Comhar Leader na hÉireann, the Community Partnership Network and PLANET) on the 31st July. At this meeting, the networks agreed to the revised membership requirements for which I had secured Government approval.  These new arrangements most notably included the provision of three additional seats for representatives of community and voluntary organisations on local development boards.Given the importance of local development companies in their area of operation and the amount of public funds that they disperse, the Government is keen to ensure that they operate to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition there are concerns about the size of boards and the transparency of board election/selection procedures leading, in turn, to concerns relating to the democratic legitimacy of such organisations and public accountability generally. While the number of reserved spaces on boards is reduced, this is in the context of smaller boards where the influence of particular directors cannot be diminished by boards of unlimited size. Boards will continue to have a mix of representation from local government, national social partners, statutory agencies and community and voluntary organisations. In addition further avenues of participation will be available through advisory councils.In regard to the participation of elected representatives, the Government has decided that representation by elected members from local authorities including town councils is more appropriate to local development bodies in view of their specific local focus and area based perspective. In relation to T.D. (and Senators) I am considering ways in which they can be routinely kept informed of the work of the companies in their constituencies.Governance guidelines have been drawn up by my Department in response to requests from the local development companies following extensive in consultation with stakeholders and their representative bodies. These reflect the Government decision and provide a template that enables the companies to operate to the highest standards of governance. The Guidelines provide a model of rotation in regard to the tenure of chairpersons and directors that aims to strike a balance between the need to refresh the board and to achieve reasonable continuity.  For example, a Director may serve up to three terms as Director (i.e. may be appointed once and re-appointed twice) but can serve for only two consecutive terms.Apart from some mandatory provisions relating to the size of boards and the selection and distribution of board members, companies are not required to follow the guidelines exactly once they can demonstrate to my Department that the highest standards of corporate governance will be observed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Firstly, I would like once more to reiterate that, notwithstanding the perception in the media and elsewhere, the Official Languages Act does not require that all official documents have to be translated into Irish. On the contrary, only a very limited number of key documents produced by public bodies currently require translation into Irish under the Act. These comprise official Annual Reports and Accounts of public bodies and major policy statements such as White Papers, Green Papers, Statements of Strategy, etc.  Translation does not apply across the board to consultative documents and other reports in general.The documents that require translation are all key documents by which public bodies are accountable to the general public, to their specific customers and to the Oireachtas in relation to how they have discharged their public functions in the previous year, or propose to do so in the future. There are two official languages spoken in this State and it seems to me — as it did to all parties in this House when we debated this Act as a Bill — right and proper that documents of this nature should be available to the citizen in both languages.  Indeed, I would make the point that when we debated the Bill in the House I was requested, but declined, to accept amendments that would have widened quite considerably the range of documents subject to the automatic simultaneous publication obligation.Clearly, the cost of translation is only a proportion of the total cost of producing such documents and, more importantly, in the context of the overall administrative budgets available to the vast majority of public bodies, represents a fairly insignificant cost element.  However, translation costs tend to be particularly visible as many public bodies do not appear to have translation capacity in-house and external expertise has to be bought in.The Deputy will be aware that my Department, in association with Foras na Gaeilge, has brought forward a number of initiatives — including the accreditation system for translators and the provision of on-line resources — to assist public bodies in dealing with the translation requirements under the Act in the most effective manner possible. This work will continue.In general terms, as I have outlined on a number of occasions in this House, I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation, on a phased basis, of the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003.  The work of implementing the Act is being kept under continuing review by my Department but I would stress once again the long-term and phased nature of the project.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I reject the Deputy's allegation that I would disregard any threat to the farming industry in Ireland. Conditions for trade in animal products with third countries follow the principles established under agreements of World Trade Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health. The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to monitor their compliance in  third countries it has approved for trade with the EU. This approval is on the basis that the Commission adjudges the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection of animal and human health to those being operated in the Community. Where there are risks to the public or animal health in the Community from disease outbreaks occurring in approved third countries Safeguard Measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated.I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers. As you know Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU Directives on such matters as traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection. I am firmly of the view that our farmers who respect and produce to the highest standards deserve fair play in the market place. In this context I have been in regular contact EU Commissioner for Health Mr. Markos Kyprianou. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. I am continuing to pursue this matter with the Commission particularly in the light of the outcome of the most recent and of the forthcoming EU Food and Veterinary Office mission to Brazil.

I support that authorization process.As I have already informed the House, I welcome the signing of an agreement recently between EFSA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to assess food safety risks. I hope that the difficulties associated with the lack of synchronization in the GM authorization processes between the EU and the US will be addressed as part of this agreement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The source of all legally imported meat is known at the point of import. On direct import into the EU all consignments of animal products including beef from Brazil, must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks in accordance with EU rules at a EU approved Border Inspection Post. These checks confirm that the products have been sourced from a third country approved to export these products to the EU and from an approved establishment in that country, that they are appropriately labelled, packaged and that have been health certified in accordance with EU requirements by the competent authorities of the exporting country. On release from a BIP each consignment must travel under a Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED), including information on the identity and origin of the consignment, to a Food Business Operator who, under EU Hygiene of Food and Feed Regulations, is authorized to place the animal products on to the market for human consumption. These Regulations also provide that the identity of the Food Business Operator placing the products on the market appear on a label in order to guarantee food safety as well as for the purpose of traceability in the protection of animal and public health.Approval of countries to trade with the EU is a matter for the EU Commission and the EU Commissioner for Health has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. In this context the EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) is to carry out a further mission to Brazil in November to assess progress in the implementation and operation of controls by the competent authorities in that country.Consumers are entitled to information on the country of origin of beef. For this reason I collaborated with the Minister for Health & Children to ensure the introduction of legislation providing that beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector must also carry an indication of the country of origin. Responsibility for enforcement of this legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).The concept of substantial transformation is the basis used throughout the EU and elsewhere to define the origin of goods as being from the country where the last substantial economic change was made to them.   In my view it should not be used to disguise the origin of certain products or to mislead the consumer as to the origin of raw materials.   Last year the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission undertook a consultative process with a view to reviewing food labelling legislation.  In its submission to the Commission Ireland recommended that the term "substantial transformation" should be strictly interpreted.  It is essential that this process should not be used to hide the true origin of products and that labelling systems be adapted to ensure that consumers are not misled as regards the true provenance of a food.  The status of the EU review of the general labelling Directive is that an interservice consultation has taken place in the Commission and the Commission is expected to present a proposal in December 2007.  I will continue to press for a satisfactory outcome in this review of the food labelling legislation in the EU.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	480	In November 1999, the HEA published a study on the demand and need for graduates in Pharmacy.  The study was undertaken on behalf of the HEA by Peter Bacon and Associates, Economic Consultants.  At that time, the only course was in Trinity College Dublin and provided 70 graduates per annum.The Bacon report recommended that at least 50 extra graduates per annum would be required to fill the positions that will exist in the medium term.  A forum on the Need for Pharmacy Graduates was held in 2000 which allowed for a response to Dr. Bacon's report and a report of the forum was submitted to the then Minister for Education and Science for consideration.  The Minister asked the HEA to seek proposals from the 3rd level sector to provide for an increase of 50 pharmacy graduates a year. The call was issued in August 2000.University College Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons were successful in the bidding process. It was then agreed that a total of 80 new places should be allocated.  The RCSI course commenced in 2002/03 with an intake of 50 students.  This intake went back to 30 in 2003/04 when the UCC pharmacy course commenced with an intake of 50 students.There are now 150 places in undergraduate pharmacy for Irish/ EU students.  In August 2005, FAS published a ‘Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report' which reviewed the demand for healthcare professionals.  In relation to pharmacy, the report stated that the current number of university places, along with re-entry to the market of registered but non-practicing pharmacists, and immigration, will ensure a reasonable balance between demand and supply.High points requirements are not necessarily an indicator of a need for extra places, but rather an indication that the number of places is below the demand for places.

The circular (53/2007) outlines the resources that are available to assist schools in this task.  I am satisfied that the allocation of language teacher support posts to schools, as outlined in the circular, represents the most efficient use of resources in catering for the significant numbers of children for whom English is their second language.Over 12,000 places are available for adults in English language classes to improve their English language skills.  The English language classes are provided by the Vocational Education Committees throughout the country.A review into the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally resident adult immigrants has been undertaken by the Office for Integration in conjunction with my Department.  An international group of consultants have been commissioned to undertake an independent review of existing provision of language training for adults in Ireland.  The review will run for approximately six months which will result in a report which is anticipated at this stage to be completed early in 2008.  My Department will consider the findings and recommendations of the review in due course.My Department fully recognises the vital role of parents and other family members in children's literacy development.  In this regard, a new family literacy project will be initiated in 2008 under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) educational inclusion action plan.  A working group of parties involved in family literacy has been established to oversee the project including the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA), the Irish Vocational Education Committee (IVEA), the Office of the Minister for Children, An Comhairle Leabharlanna and officials of my Department.  The project will build on previous experience in the area of family literacy and will be implemented on a phased basis.

These resources are provided through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs).The State recognises the rights of parents and guardians as primary educators and respects their right to send their child to a school of their choice.  Should parents choose not to avail of State recognised schooling and select a private school, this is of course entirely a matter for them.  My Department does not however provide special educational needs supports including special needs assistant supports to private primary schools or fund teaching resources in these schools.

Teachers are free to choose their own texts and materials to achieve the overall objectives of the programme, and are expected to choose from a wide range of literary genre and other print and media material.  Lists appropriate to each year are set out in the Teacher Guidelines for English, but these are intended to be neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.  Students are required to read, listen and respond to a range of literary genre including poetry, drama, prose, film, radio, etc.  They are also expected to be able to understand and encounter concepts such as plot, comedy, tragedy, satire, pathos, melodrama, theatre, lyrical and narrative, tone and irony, and symbolism.In that context, while my Department does not prescribe texts for the syllabus, and does not approve textbooks, it is considered that Poisoning Pigeons in the Park presents a useful illustration of the different genre and concepts which students could be expected to encounter during the programme.

It is operated through the Vocational Education Committees.The aims of the Scheme are to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance.  The student ceases to receive an unemployment payment and, instead, receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate.  VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.The allowances for VTOS students, for meal and travel, referred to in the questions are equivalent to these paid to participants on FÁS training courses.  VTOS students may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre.  These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in FÁS rates.  The current rates are in operation since 2002.  There are no plans to increase them in the near future.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	491	My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.  The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  Among the factors which give rise to delays in processing applications is where the administering body is awaiting further information/documentation from applicants, or applicants have failed to submit complete application forms.The Deputy will already be aware that I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector.  This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system.  The scheme will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill which facilitates greater consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.  This is part of my overall strategy to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes.  These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants.Mature students may be categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.The residency clause of the scheme requires, in the case of a candidate under 23, that the candidate's parents or guardians to have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year.  In the case of an independent mature candidate the candidate himself/herself must have been resident in the administrative area of a Local Authority from 1st October of the previous year.  The Local Authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.  I would, however, point out that the type of situation where residency is waived is, for example, where an independent mature candidate him/herself has missed the residency requirement by a relatively short period of time.In cases where a candidate returns to the State following a period abroad and where the awarding body decides, at its discretion, to waive the residency requirement the candidate may be assessed for the grant without meeting the prescribed residency requirement from 1st October of the previous year.One of the main considerations in this type of case is the period of time a candidate has resided outside of the State.  The Department suggests that in such cases, the residency requirement may be waived at the discretion of the awarding body only where the period of time abroad does not exceed one year.On this basis, and on condition that the students submits satisfactory evidence of independent residence prior to going abroad and for the period after their return, the Department has no objection to a candidate being assessed as an independent mature candidate for the purpose of the grant application.In cases where a candidate has been out of the country for a period of time of more than one year before commencing his/her course, irrespective of whether or not he/she can produce evidence of independent living prior to going abroad, she/he would not be eligible to be considered under the residency clause of the scheme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Funding to schools to cover their day-to-day running costs has increased substantially in recent years.  Indeed, this year schools benefited from the largest ever increase in the capitation grant.With increases in capitation and ancillary services funding, primary schools are now getting €95 more per pupil per year than they were in 2002.  The capitation grant has been increased to €163.58 per child, and the ancillary services grant has risen to €145.50 per child, bringing the total value of both grants to nearly €310 per pupil.  This amounts to €93,000 a year for a 300-pupil school.At second level, the capitation grant has increased by €50 per student since 2002 from €266 to €316.  The school support services grant which we introduced in 2000, has been increased significantly to €189 per student for voluntary secondary schools with effect from January 2007.  Voluntary secondary schools are now getting €505 per student in capitation and support services grants.This amounts to €293,000 a year for a 500-student voluntary school.  Schools have, therefore, benefited from major increases in funding in recent years.  A small number of schools have, however, sought assistance from my Department as an exceptional matter to deal with serious financial difficulties.Between 2002 to 2006, my Department provided additional financial assistance for this purpose to a total of 97 schools, mainly serving disadvantaged areas.In 2002, 26 schools received approximately €341,000;In 2003, 25 schools were allocated a total of €519,000;In 2004, €108,000 was given to 10 schools;In 2005, 32 schools shared a total of €784,000; andLast year, just over €112,000 was paid to 4 schools.During the same period, the following numbers of schools have sought assistance:2002 — 27 schools2003 — 27 schools2004 — 33 schools2005 — 43 schools2006 — 52 schoolsIt should be noted that the responsibility for sound financial management of schools' affairs rests with school authorities and these were exceptional payments.The majority of these were schools serving disadvantaged areas.  The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion.  In the last school year, DEIS related grants totalling more than €17 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This represented a substantial increase on the 05/06 level of almost €12 million.The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities going forward.  The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented.  In 2007, we are investing nearly €730 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels.  This represents an increase of nearly €95 million on the 2006 figure and an almost 60% increase on the €460 million provided in 2003.As well as continuing to prioritise disadvantaged schools, we are also determined to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools benefit from increased funding over the next five years.  The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to double the standard capitation grant for primary schools.  Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.In summary, therefore, we have substantially increased funding for schools and will prioritise further improvements in the years head.

In order to meet their language needs, my Department in May 2007 issued a circular, reference 0053/2007, to the managerial authorities of all schools — both primary and post primary — to assist them in providing an inclusive school environment to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. The circular outlines the resources that are available to assist schools in this task. The circular is accessible on the website of my Department.Language support teachers are appointed to assist schools in providing additional language support teaching for pupils. In collaboration with parents and class teachers, language support teachers identify pupils requiring additional support, administer the assessment materials developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training, devise appropriate language programmes, deliver the programmes and record and monitor pupils' progress.  It is important that expertise is shared and good practice is communicated and disseminated in order to optimise the opportunities pupils have for developing their proficiency in English.The level of additional teacher support allocated to primary and post primary schools will continue to be determined by the number of enrolled pupils for whom English is a second language and the associated assessed levels of pupils' language proficiency.  The circular sets out the resources that can be accessed by schools to cater for such pupils where the number of pupils in the school is 14 or more. Some schools currently have up to 6 language support teacher posts.In addition, schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over €6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over €9,500. Over €4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.My Department will continue to respond to requests by schools for additional language support teachers in accordance with the terms of the relevant regulations and will ensure that the investment in this area is underpinned by the right support and training for the teachers.

In particular, the Social Personal and Health Education programmes at primary and post primary levels, are designed to prepare students for participatory citizenship and to develop the skills of critical appraisal and decision-making based on human rights and social responsibilities. They also promote respect for human dignity, tolerance for the values and beliefs of others, and a celebration of diversity.

My Department has received 38 notices of intention to open new schools next year — of which only 7 are for schools with a Catholic ethos. All of these schools are being assessed through a process that involves public consultation.A new model of primary school patronage is also being developed which will cater for the diversity of religious faiths represented in growing urban areas. This new model of community primary school will be piloted next year in West Dublin under the patronage of Co. Dublin VEC.In relation to a forum on the future of primary education, the new model of community national school is being discussed with all the education partners and there is plenty of opportunity within existing structures for consultation and debate.

It's remit includes responsibility for the provision of support to teachers of ESL in primary and second-level schools.The main areas of work of IILT are:The preparation and provision of scaled curriculaThe preparation and provision of teaching and learning materialsThe organisation and delivery of seminars for language support teachersLanguage assessment kits, based on best international practice are to be provided to all primary schools during the 2007/08 school year. The kits will enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of language proficiency of newcomer children with a particular focus upon assessing whether language support needs to be provided beyond the current two year limit.My Department has also distributed a resource book ("Up and Away") to all primary schools which will assist teachers of ESL. In addition, my Department will shortly distribute a set of resource materials prepared by IILT to all second level schools to support the teaching and learning of ESL.In addition IILT has provided a number of seminars for teachers in 2007.I am aware also that teachers of ESL have recently established a professional network, English Language Support Teachers Association, (ELSTA) under the Teacher Professional Network Scheme which is funded through Teacher Education Section in my Department. This network will assist teachers of ESL in the provision of peer professional development.It is in the context of these various initiatives that the ongoing professional development of language support teachers is being considered by my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	501	In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department allocates additional teaching support or portions of teacher posts to schools.The level of extra teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled and the associated assessed levels of pupils' language proficiency.Each school management can decide on the structure of the support to be provided in its own school.The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority subject to agreed procedures. It is a matter for the school authority to deploy the teacher allocation having regard to the proficiency levels of individual pupils involved and in line with their evolving needs.The resource allocated for language support in respect of individual pupils is given for a temporary period and accordingly the posts provided for this purpose may only be approved on a temporary basis.There has been a significant increase in the number of language support teachers in recent years.  Ongoing training is being provided to these teachers with eleven seminars arranged in 2007.Teachers of English as a second language (ESL) have recently established a professional network, English Language Support Teachers Association, (ELSTA) under the Teacher Professional Network Scheme which is funded by my Department. This network will assist teachers of ESL in the provision of peer professional development.In view of the significant increase in the number of language support teachers my Department is currently investigating the establishment of an integrated support structure for teachers of English as a second language at primary and post primary level.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department's student maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance may not generally be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded.  However, the awarding body may waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness.  It should be emphasised, however, that this discretion would generally only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas on UN mandated operations, observer missions or undertaking representative or staff postings are listed in the tabular statement attached. Of the 460 personnel currently serving overseas, 142 are officers and 318 are other ranks.The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed, are the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 272 personnel and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 57 personnel.  In addition, 41 personnel are serving in EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.KFOR was established in June, 1999 to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo, so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.  Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The Irish (37th) Infantry Group currently serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre). In addition to Ireland, the Task Force also comprises troops from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. The Task Force's area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million.The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC Mounted Infantry Group of some 215 personnel, including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR Headquarters. Last August, Ireland assumed the role of Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force (Centre) in Kosovo for a period of 12 months.  An additional 57 Irish personnel are serving with KFOR in support of the Framework Nation role, bringing Ireland's current total deployment to the force to 272.Following the cessation of hostilities in Lebanon in July/August 2006, an Irish Infantry Group deployed to South Lebanon on 31 October, 2006 as part of the integrated Finnish/Irish Battalion within UNIFIL, to carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance and reconstruction.  Ireland provided the security detail for the Engineering contingent from Finland.  The Finnish/Irish Battalion completed its deployment at the end of last month and the withdrawal process is currently underway.  109 Irish personnel returned to Ireland on 1 November, 2007 and the remaining members of the Battalion will return to Ireland later this month. A small number of Defence Forces personnel will continue to serve at UNIFIL HQ.Ireland has participated in EUFOR since December 2004, the successor mission to the Stabilisation force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina with which Ireland had previously been serving since 1997.  The Irish contingent with EUFOR currently comprises 41 personnel. The role of the Defence Forces personnel currently serving in EUFOR is to provide personnel for the headquarters, the Military Police Unit, Verification Teams and the National Support Element. All Irish personnel are located at Camp Butmir, Sarajevo.Ireland has participated in International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. Since then, the Government have reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.Following Government approval in October 2007, eleven Irish personnel are currently serving at the Headquarters of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA  — the new EU mission to the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic.  Ireland's commitment under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS) is 850, which represents 10% of the total Army strength.  This is the figure set out in the White Paper on Defence and is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas operations.  There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS and any contribution to EU or UN Missions will be met within the context of the 850 ceiling.Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  A proposal to deploy a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU mission to CHAD and the Central African Republic is currently under consideration.  A report on the proposed operation, following a detailed reconnaissance of the mission area and tasking, together with a threat assessment, is currently being completed by the military authorities.  This will inform the final decision on the nature of our participation should the Government decide to deploy troops on the ground in Chad.  Subject to a satisfactory assessment, the Irish Defence Force contribution is expected to be in the region of 350 to 400 personnel.  The Minister expects to bring proposals to Government shortly and, subject to the approval of the Government, to put the matter before Dáil Éireann before the end of November.  Obviously, any decision to participate will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Defence Acts.Number1.

Pre-deployment training is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force and is updated in the light of any change in the threat assessment.Defence Forces personnel have for many years attended workshops, training courses, desktop exercises, seminars and other events overseas as part of their military training and will continue to do this. Ireland also participates in the Partnership for Peace, Planning and Review Process (known as PARP). In common with the other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management, collectively known as the Petersberg tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multi-national environment.  PfP activities are entirely voluntary and are based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation.The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.

Ireland is currently contributing 460 Defence Forces personnel to 17 different missions throughout the world.The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed, are the NATO-led UN Mandated International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 272 personnel and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with  57 personnel.  In addition, 41 personnel are serving in EUFOR, the UN mandated EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO. With regard to Ireland's participation in PfP, I can confirm there has been no discussions or negotiations in relation to the formation of standby peacekeeping forces under the PFP.

The Implementation Plan is being rolled-out on a phased basis up to 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. a new organisation structure implemented with effect from October 2005, major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the RDF is now structured along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force (3 Brigades and the RDF Training Centre).  The integrated reserve is being piloted across the 3 Brigades this year.Now that the new organization structures, training syllabus etc. are in place it is appropriate that more focus be placed on recruitment.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Minister has approved a publicity and awareness campaign to promote recruitment to the RDF in line with the commitment in ‘An Agreed Programme for Government'.  This is scheduled to commence early in 2008.  Concurrent with the national campaign, units will conduct local campaigns to capture the benefits of the national campaign.I am pleased that the Implementation Plan is progressing well.  The Department will continue to monitor progress in the remaining period of the Plan.YearOfficersNCO’sPrivatesTotal2007 (Sept. 07)6692,4185,5598,64620066822,5535,8999,13420056882,7407,40510,83320047192,9879,06312,76920037332,9469,85313,532
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 30 September 2007, as advised by the military authorities, was 10,361.  This comprises 8,444 in the Army, 849 in the Air Corps and 1,068 in the Naval Service.It is intended to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at a level required to meet military needs and as set out in the White Paper i.e. 10,500 Permanent Defence Force all ranks.  The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure that an overall PDF strength of 10,500 is maintained.The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships.  All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.The Naval Service provides a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.  At present, fishery protection activity accounts for roughly 90% of all Naval Service patrol time.  However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles.  The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.  In 2006, the Naval Service achieved an output of 1,658 patrol days, which represents an average of 207 patrol days achieved per vessel.Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  In 2006, a total of 251 maritime patrols were flown by the CASA over 229 days, representing over 1,400 flying hours.  These hours are expected to increase on completion in 2008 of the major mid life upgrade on the two CASA aircraft, which is currently underway.I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force is fully resourced, to meet all its operational requirements.

The vehicle for this consultation process was a policy document outlining policy proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill.  The document was entitled "Immigration and Residence in Ireland".  More than 120 organisations and individuals made submissions as part of this process reflecting a very wide range of concerns and interests in the migration system.Following on from that process the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007 was published and initiated in the Seanad on 25 April 2007.  The current Government, as part of its agreed Programme for Government, committed itself to reviewing the Bill and accordingly the Bill was not restored to the Order Paper of the Seanad.  However, it is my intention to bring forward a proposal to Government seeking approval for the publication of a new Bill, incorporating the substance of the published Bill, during this Session.With regard to integration, the Deputy will be aware that Mr. Conor Lenihan, T.D, was appointed Minister of State at the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform (with special responsibility for Integration Policy).  Minister of State Lenihan will be involved in the development of a long-term national policy on integration which will be informed by widespread consultation at a national level, properly structured objective research and international experience and best practice.Minister of State Lenihan has announced that he will be setting up a task force early next year that will consult widely to identify key issues affecting immigrant communities and report back to him  with specific recommendations.

My Department is at present engaged in that process and a Strategy Statement for period 2008-2010 will be available in due course.  Having regard to the agreed goals and objectives identified in that Strategy Statement appropriate work plans will be put in place in order to progress those goals and objectives.Data accumulation and analysis in relation to asylum and immigration matters forms a regular part of strategic planning in these areas.  Data on a wide range of asylum and immigration areas is compiled and maintained on an ongoing basis, and used for the purpose of management reporting.  Data maintained is regularly analysed in the context of both reviewing the effectiveness of administrative and operational arrangements and in policy development.I should also mention that my Department is investing significant resources in new information technology systems in the immigration area to assist in the processing of applications from non-EEA nationals.  This investment will also have benefits in terms of management information.With regard to integration, the Deputy will be aware that Mr. Conor Lenihan, T.D, was appointed Minister of State at the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform (with special responsibility for Integration Policy).  Minister of State Lenihan has established the Office of the Minister for Integration and has a cross Departmental mandate to develop, drive and coordinate integration policy across Government departments, agencies and services.  In this context, the Minister of State will have a close relationship with Ministers and policy makers in other Departments.Minister of State Lenihan will be involved in the development of a long-term national policy on integration which will be informed by widespread consultation at a national level, properly structured objective research and international experience and best practice.Minister of State Lenihan has announced that he will be setting up a task force early next year that will consult widely to identify key issues affecting immigrant communities and report back to him  with specific recommendations.

The area is not secure, and An Garda Síochána are in contact with the owners in order to have it secured.  A number of incidents relating to anti-social behaviour, concerning groups of youths congregating in this area, have been reported to An Garda Síochána, particularly over the recent bank holiday weekend.  As a result a number of persons have been arrested and are being dealt with under the Juvenile Diversion Scheme.Members of the local Community Policing Unit are allocated to this area and liaise with the local community.  Additional Garda foot and mobile patrols, including patrols by District Detective and Drug Units, the Community Policing Unit and the Mountain Bike Units, supplemented by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps Unit, have been directed to pay particular attention to this area.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

Under this legislation, monies or property frozen pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 of the Act remain frozen for a period of at least seven years. The only exception to this minimum seven year waiting period is whereby all relevant parties agree to the application of a section 4a order which allows for a disposal order to be made by the High Court within the seven year period with the consent of all parties.  These consent provisions were introduced in 2005 under the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act of that year.  The issue of this standard minimum seven year waiting period being reduced to a minimum three year period was considered by the Oireachtas during its examination of and discussion on that Amendment Act.  Taking account of the introduction of the new consent provisions, the approach taken in the legislation was to retain the standard minimum seven year waiting period primarily on the basis that a reduction of the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order to three years might render the legislation more open to challenge in terms of due process.  While I will keep the matter under review, I currently have no plans to introduce further change in respect of this matter.

The status of the person concerned remains as set out in that Reply.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deputy may wish to note that any person the subject of a deportation order may apply to have his/her deportation order revoked pursuant to Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However, any such application would require substantial grounds to be successful.

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the first half of 2008.I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the application.

This regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of "asylum shopping" across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of "refugees in orbit", a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.The current political situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.C.) is a matter for the French authorities to consider in deciding whether or not to repatriate him to his home country. France is a party to and thus bound by international human rights instruments which prohibit refoulement. The current development of a common EU asylum policy is predicated on the full and inclusive application of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, thus maintaining its principle of non-refoulement. Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 is based on this common policy and Regulation States, all respecting the principle of non-refoulement, are considered safe for third country nationals.

The status of the person concerned remains as set out in that Reply.Since the earlier Reply, the legal representative of the person concerned, by correspondence dated 28 August 2007, wrote to my Department lodging, inter alia, an application for Subsidiary Protection. My officials, by letter dated 7 September 2007, advised that while the person concerned did not have an automatic entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection, pursuant to the decision in Hila and Djolo judgement handed down in the High Court on 27 July 2007 by Mr. Justice Feeney, he was invited to make representations to me setting out any new facts or circumstances which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made and requesting that I exercise my discretion under Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.As my Department did not receive any documentation requesting the exercise of my discretion under Regulation 4 (2) of the aforesaid Regulations within the 15 working days allotted, my officials wrote to the legal representative of the person concerned by letter dated 3 October 2007 to advise that the time to make representations had passed.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The application was refused as the individual concerned did not meet the continuous residency criteria.  Judicial review proceedings have been initiated in respect of this refusal.My Department is currently appealing a number of matters related to the IBC/05 scheme, including the issue of continuous residency, to the Supreme Court. The application in question, including the residency status of the individual concerned, may be considered further in the light of the findings of the Court.

She was refused refugee status.  Her application seeking permission to remain in the State, which was based on her being a part of her parents' family unit, was refused.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 21 April, 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order was made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  On 3 June, 2004 the person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds for a period of one year.  This permission to remain has been renewed on a yearly basis, the current renewal being valid until 7 September, 2007.  The current application for renewal of the permission to remain in the State of the person  is currently under consideration by my Department.  I expect a decision to issue in due course.The position regarding naturalisation is that an application from the person concerned to my Department must clearly indicate that the applicant has been legally resident in the State for five consecutive years.

Once an applicant has the necessary number of months stamped in their passport, a short term absence from the State will not affect their application for a certificate of naturalisation.

This bog is a candidate Special Area of Conservation.  The derogation permitting a continuation of turf cutting for domestic purposes in SACs is due to expire in 2008.A recent review of the state of our bogs has revealed continuing damage due to domestic turf cutting.  As a consequence, no extension to the derogation, which was intended to allow domestic turf cutters a transitional 10 year period to move from turf cutting to an alternative fuel source, can be permitted.  My Department operates a generous purchase scheme for bog or turbary owners who are affected by the restrictions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Under Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted by the elected members of the authority.  Subject to this, the types of public infrastructure that can be funded by a development contribution scheme are further specified as the acquisition of land, the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and amenities and landscaping works, the provision of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water treatment facilities, drains and watermains, the provision of bus corridors and lanes, bus interchanges facilities (car parks for those facilities), infrastructure to facilitate public transport, cycle and pedestrian facilities, and traffic calming measures, the refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of roads, car parks, car parking places, sewers, waste water and water facilities, drains or water mains, and ancillary matters.Under the Act, income from development levies must be applied to pay for facilities servicing new development.  The legislation also requires planning authorities to base the contributions on the actual cost of providing the infrastructure in question.  However, there is no legislative requirement, nor would it be practical, for planning authorities to direct contributions received from a specific development exclusively towards a particular service or facility.In May 2007 my Department published a report arising from the deliberations of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Development Contribution Schemes.  This report was also accompanied by a guidance circular to all planning authorities which focused on a number of key issues identified by the Committee, including the importance of transparency in relation to the extent to which linkages between the development levies paid and the infrastructure projects funded from those revenues are demonstrated.  Planning authorities were advised that developers should reasonably expect to be able to identify the infrastructural gain to which their contribution has been put.More generally, it is a matter for planning authorities to determine their own policy requirements in relation to the provision of off-street car-parking, for instance, through the inclusion of specific objectives in their Development Plans.  In drafting the Development Plan, planning authorities are statutorily required to elicit the views and comments of any interested parties through a public consultation process at draft and material amendment stages.  These views and comments are presented to the elected members by the Manager for their consideration.

I understand the Council is currently proceeding with arrangements for land acquisition for the Adare element and revising its contract documents for both elements of the scheme.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-08 00:00:00	Prelude	552	The Planning Code provides for extensive public notification of proposed development.  It is a general requirement that a valid application for planning permission must be advertised by site notice and newspaper notice.  The site notice must state, inter alia, that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority, and that submissions or observations in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing on payment of the prescribed fee within the 5 week period beginning on the date of the receipt by the planning authority of the application.  A notice of the proposed development must also be published in an approved local or national newspaper.  This must also set out details in relation to the inspection of planning applications and the making of submissions and observations.Ordinarily an appeal on a decision of a planning authority decision can be made only by the applicant, or an individual or group who made submissions or observations in writing to the planning authority in relation to the planning application in accordance with permission regulations.  However, an exception is provided for persons with an interest in land adjoining the site which is the subject of the application.  Section 37(6)(a) of the 2000 Act provides that a landowner/occupier on the site adjoining the application site may apply to the Board for leave to appeal the decision of the planning authority, within four weeks of the decision, even without having made submissions or observations to the planning authority in the first instance.It is also possible for an individual to apply to the High Court for leave to seek a judicial review of a planning decision.  Leave must usually be sought within eight weeks of the decision, and the High Court may only grant leave where it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or should be quashed.  The person seeking leave must also have a substantial interest in the decision and have participated in the decision making process or had good and sufficient reasons for not doing so.

It is a collaborative project between my Department, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive.I am satisfied at this stage that RAS is meeting the objectives set for it by Government and that all housing authorities are implementing RAS and have transferred cases to RAS accommodation.  Individual housing authorities include targets for transfer of households to RAS in their multi-annual Social and Affordable Housing Action Plans which are submitted to my Department.

The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of rural communities and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing sewerage networks.The pilot projects are now complete and undergoing commissioning.  Monitoring of the performance of the new infrastructure by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee has commenced and the Committee has been asked to report to me on results as they become available. I intend to review the grants for group sewerage schemes in light of the outcome of the pilot programme.

Producers and retailers who place substantial amounts of packaging on the market do, however, have a range of responsibilities under the relevant legislation.  If they join a packaging waste compliance scheme, they contribute to the overall cost of the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  If they opt not to join such a scheme, they must accept back at their own premises, free of charge, any packaging waste of the type which they supply.

The overall sum takes account of the levels of payment recommended by the Independent Group and the recorded catch history of the eligible licensees. An additional €5 million is being provided under a Community Support Scheme, the focus of which primarily will be those communities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric of the area.
