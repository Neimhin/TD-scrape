#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is this aspect of the proposals on which I want to focus.  We need honest debate in the House about the choices facing us.  The worrying element of the proposals outlined to Deputies last night was that of the pending closure of community hospitals around the country.  There are more than 100 such units and they give excellent care to the elderly.  Such drastic action would seem impossible if not for the fact that the Government has already confirmed the closure of two community hospitals in County Laois, one in Abbeyleix and the other in Shane.  Deputy Charles Flanagan stated on the public record that these closures were being dressed up as cost savings.  This comes despite the promise in the programme for Government to prioritise investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings.  As the Taoiseach knows, those units look after high-dependency patients and have multidisciplinary teams that often are not available to the same extent in private nursing homes.

Society is facing demographic challenges.  Thankfully, people are living longer today than they would have five or ten years ago.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I wrote to Deputy Martin and the other leaders recently to suggest to them that they should avail of the opportunity that has been there for many years for Opposition parties to present the cost proposals on their alternatives in preparation for the budget.  I would like to provide an opportunity for Deputy Martin, his party and everybody else to reflect on the Estimates that the Government has to deal with and decide on.  We will see the colour of their eyes at that stage.For the Deputy's information, I said that I would consider the question of the material that was sent to the European Commission.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I received it this morning in the Oireachtas Library.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Government supplied the material belatedly.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Will Deputy Martin please stop interrupting?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	24	That is arrogance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I said I would consider it.  The reason that the European Commission sent that to the finance committee of the Bundestag is that it is a constitutional requirement of the German Parliament that, where it is funding countries in a bailout, this kind of information must be made available.  As I pointed out to Deputy Martin before, due to the fact that the budget is so close, the German Parliament is looking for indicative material, which is now placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I hope this deals with that matter.  For the Deputy's information, we will continue to publish the quarterly reviews once they have been adopted and signed off on by the troika.In respect of the community hospitals the Deputy mentioned and other issues of serious concern in the health Department, what is going on here is the normal process of pre-budget discussion with elected representatives of the two parties in government.  From this point of view, I confirm to Deputy Martin again that, of the long range of all of the Departments' issues, the Government has not signed off on the details that will be put in the budget.I understand exactly the quality and the challenge that front line staff, carers and workers in community hospitals have to face, but I am also a realist.  Many of these buildings are very old and require pretty serious refurbishment and very costly maintenance and upkeep.  What is involved is a review of all of that to see what is in the best interests of the homes' residents.I confirm to Deputy Martin and the House that the Cabinet has not signed off on the list the Deputy mentioned.  The discussions that took place at the internal committees of both parties in government — the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party — are normal discussions that take place about the options open to all Ministers as they prepare for this budget, which is, as the Deputy knows, challenging, difficult and something that he refused to face for many years.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Is it better for members of the parliamentary party to get access to the information?  The Taoiseach and his Ministers are involved in a deeply cynical practice of raising all sorts of issues, frightening the living daylights out of people that certain things are going to happen and then coming up with the cynical line that the Government has signed off on nothing.  Who is the Taoiseach codding?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The Taoiseach is codding no one.  I wanted a straight answer.  In terms of quality of care in how they look after high dependency patients, these community nursing units are superior to anything in the private sector.  We need a debate on that issue in this House.  I want a genuine debate about community nursing units.  There should be no codology about having a normal discussion with members of the parliamentary parties of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment to the elderly in this country and it is about time we had an honest debate on it.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Táim ag éisteacht.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Yesterday, the Cabinet acted promptly to establish an independent inquiry into a broadcast by RTE and that is to be commended.  The patient support and advocacy organisation, Dignity4Patients, has been campaigning for decades for an independent commission of inquiry into allegations about the sexual abuse of boys and young men in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The Taoiseach supported this demand in Opposition, as did the Tánaiste.  In July, the Minister for Health promised an inquiry and acknowledged that many people have suffered as a consequence of not having this issue aired in public.  He told the Joint Committee on Health and Children that he had the agreement of the Attorney General that there would be an Oireachtas committee of inquiry following the referendum.  The referendum was not passed but the need and demand for an inquiry remains.I could also raise the issues of ministerial leaks about increases in prescription charges, the closure of nursing homes, cuts in child benefit and further attacks on what remains of our sovereignty by the bigger states in the EU.  We will return to these issues.  The need to hold an independent inquiry into the allegations of sexual abuse must be dealt with today with the same urgency the Taoiseach showed in dealing with RTE.  How can anyone have faith in a Government that refuses to stand up for the citizens and fails to assure the public that the systemic failures in the health services have been corrected?  Will the Taoiseach establish an independent commission of inquiry into these events, as promised in Opposition, and will he announce this before the Christmas recess?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank Deputy Adams for his question.  This is a matter of serious concern and has been for quite some time.  In respect of the inquiry that the Government yesterday instructed be held, arising from the grievous offence caused to Fr. Kevin Reynolds, I respect completely the independence of the Press Ombudsman, Mr. Horgan.  He is carrying out an investigation and I have no question over his independence in his role.  Following the initiative taken by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I thought it important that the Government act in the best interests of the highest standards in journalism and the rights of every person in this matter.I had hoped the referendum would be passed in respect of giving authority to Oireachtas committees to carry out investigations in matters of public interest.  That did not happen.  The commitment entered into by the Minister for Health was on that basis and now we must consult the Opposition parties and take the advice of the Attorney General to see what options are available in respect of pursuing the truth and the issue raised concerning Dr. Shine.  This is a matter of serious concern and I would like to discuss the options with Deputy Adams and Deputy Martin, following advice from the Attorney General.  I will not make any commitment other than that until I see the best options open to us.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	73	With respect, that is not good enough.  The Cabinet has the authority to authorise such a commission of inquiry and the Minister for Health has already received advice from the Attorney General.  It is very clear.  I received a letter from a victim of this abuse and he implores the Taoiseach to do something about this, as promised.  He included a copy of an e-mail he had sent to the Taoiseach a few years ago and the reply.  In that reply, the Taoiseach told him that Fine Gael and the Labour Party had tabled a motion in support of an inquiry, which Fianna Fáil and the Green Party voted down.  I have a copy of the motion, which is good.  At the end of the letter, the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil and the Green Party were wrong to do this.  If the Taoiseach also refuses to hold an independent inquiry, he will also be wrong.  I want the Taoiseach to be right on this issue, not for his sake or my sake but for the sake of the victims.  This will also build confidence that justice is possible and that flaws in our system can be corrected.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Can Deputy Adams ask a question?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I ask the Taoiseach to give a commitment that he will announce a commission of inquiry before the Christmas recess and that he will consult the victims of this alleged abuse on the terms of reference.  The patients' advocacy group Dignity4Patients has had its funding cut significantly.  I have raised this issue before with the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach to ensure the group is provided with core funding to continue its crucial work on behalf of 200 citizens.  I am asking for two things: that the Taoiseach make a commitment to announce the establishment of a commission of inquiry before the recess and ensure core funding is provided for Dignity4Patients.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	76	On the second issue, I replied to the question about the allocation of money between now and the end of the year for the hospital mentioned by the Deputy and the patients to whom he referred, as well as about the plans and programmes to be put in place by the Minister to deal with that ongoing problem in the new year.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	77	It was not, the Taoiseach is mistaken.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	78	In respect of the inquiry, I have previously said I do not want to see a situation where toothless Oireachtas committees would meet to talk about issues of serious concern such as the Shine case.  I would like to be in a position to discuss the implications and the best thing to do with Deputy Adams and representatives of the Technical Group and to obtain advice on the best option legally.  I do not want to go down the road of having an endless list of tribunals and inquiries, given that some tribunals and inquiries have been running for years.  It is important that we find the truth.  I want to have the Minister for Health meet the people involved in order that we can have an understanding that we can arrive at a decision as to the best way to proceed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I had hoped to do that, but we cannot argue with the decision of the people in the referendum.  I would have thought Oireachtas committees with the appropriate powers would have been able to deal with this issue.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It concerns a commission for inquiry.  Why can the Taoiseach not do in government what he supported when in opposition?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	82	After his nomination on 9 March the Taoiseach said in the Dáil, "Honesty is not alone our best policy but our only policy."  What is honest about the cynical kite flying by half of the Cabinet in the last week, in manipulating the media and the people with stories of horror cuts and charges in order that when they are a little less when they bring them in, the hope is the people might accept them?  Will the Taoiseach prove he believes honesty is the only policy by answering a simple question?  A week before the general election the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, said, "The Labour Party will not agree to having child benefit cut; Fine Gael needs to drop its plans to cut it."  Will the Taoiseach make an honest man of the Tánaiste this morning and, more importantly, on budget day?  The programme for Government states the Government "will maintain social welfare rates".  Will the Taoiseach make an honest woman of the Minister for Social Protection this morning and, more importantly, on budget day?  The Labour Party manifesto states, "Labour believes the €500 increase in student service charges to €2,000 is a step too far.  Labour will reverse the increase".  Will the Taoiseach make an honest party of the Labour Party on budget day?  Will he insist on honesty prevailing on budget day?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Minister for Finance announced a 0.6% levy on pensions for four years to fund the so-called jobs initiative.  Tara miners have exposed the truth; this translates into a savage 10% levy on their modest pensions of €10,000 each year for four years.Will the Taoiseach restore honesty?  I want a simple yes or no answer; as I am not asking for the budget, the Taoiseach should not say I am.  I want to see if he will stand by his dictum that honesty is the only policy and honour the commitments made by his partners in government and his own party.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Deputy should be honest and tell the people the truth.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Will the Taoiseach make honest little elves of the Labour Party backbenchers who are busy mining for votes in repeating all the pledges made by their leaders?  We hear from journalists that they have been hiding in the woods for the last few days.  I would like a straight answer to this question.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The Deputy is being an elf himself.  The Deputy knows all about this.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I again ask the Deputy to please allow a question to be asked and an answer to be given.  All he is doing is encouraging disorder.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Deputy Higgins has asked four examination questions.  He reminds me a little of the return of Senator Joe McCarthy: "Did you ever, have you ever, would you ever associate with the Communist Party?  Answer ‘yes' or ‘no'."  I know the Deputy is acting as a benign parliamentary terrorist.  To answer his questions, I will make an honest leader of the Tanaiste, Deputy Gilmore.  The Deputy spoke about the Labour Party programme prior to the general election.  It included a clear reference to the child care issue.  The Tánaiste and I agreed on a programme for Government subsequently.  Therefore, the Deputy is right, the Labour Party programme was clear prior to the election.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The position after the election is different.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Can we freeze it in time?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	92	There is no denial in that regard.  The Tánaiste was completely honest in his pronouncements prior to the election.The answer to the second question is the same.  Deputy Higgins quoted correctly from Labour Party policy prior to the general election.  That is correct and there is no dishonesty in that regard.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Last night journalists said they had run for cover behind a wall of silence.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	94	That is what was stated in the Labour Party programme.  It is slightly different in the context of agreeing a programme for Government between two parties subsequently.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Keep digging.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The same applies in the case of the third question, while the fourth about the percentage levy on the pensions industry is complete fantasy, as the Deputy knows.  The point was made that the pensions industry would be well able to absorb the vast majority of the costs involved in that temporary levy which provided workers with jobs in the Deputy's constituency, which I am sure he supports.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Tara Mines has the money to pay the levy.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The Labour Party is entirely honest and the people the Deputy mentioned in that party are truthful and now operating under a programme for Government to deal with the reality of the situation.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The Taoiseach obviously has an extraordinary concept of honesty and truth.  "We will reverse rises in student fees" is clear in its meaning.  Just because the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach later had a chat and agreed they would not reverse the increase does not change the position.  The Taoiseach is, in fact, endorsing dishonesty.  The Labour Party stated it would not tolerate a reduction in child benefit, but then the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste had a chat and agreed it would be okay to do so.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	101	We are not going back over manifestoes.  May we have a supplementary question, please?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	102	That is dishonesty.  On social welfare cuts, the programme for Government — not the Labour Party — indicates social welfare rates will be maintained.On the pensions issue, it is not a fallacy.  The reality is that pensioners, men and women who slaved all their lives and are now on modest pensions, are having this burden placed on their shoulders, as the Tara Mines workers outside the gates yesterday showed us in black and white.  They face a €1,000 levy per year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	103	We are over time.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I did not know the Deputy was advertising for the Higgins grind school.  I have referred to these matters.  I met a number of the Tara miners some time ago in Navan.  We were following through on a number of specific issues they raised.  The cost of the temporary levy could well be absorbed by the pensions industry.No decisions have been made on the detail of any cuts to social welfare.  Clearly, there will have to be savings in social welfare.  Unless there is a social welfare structure that encourages employment measures and encourages people to go and want to go to work, there will not be the kind of society about which the Deputy talks and which we all want to see.  I refer to one in which people have the opportunity to have employment in their own area, if that is what they wish.What the Deputy is talking about is speculative in the sense that the Government has not signed off on this.  The programme for Government, about which the Deputy speaks, was agreed between both parties, namely, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, and it was debated in this House and passed overwhelmingly by the representatives of the people who sent us here to deliver on that mandate.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	116	It is proposed to take No. a9, Road Transport Bill 2011 — Financial Resolution; No. 9, motion re membership of committee; No. 13, statements on sustainability in the sea fisheries sector; and No. 3, Road Transport Bill 2011 — Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. a9 and 9 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 13 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 80 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements shall be made by a Minister or Minister of State and by the main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share their time and shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, and a Minister or Minister of State shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes; and No. 3 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply in regard to Second and Subsequent Stages: the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow; and the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall commence immediately upon the conclusion of Second Stage and, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in regard to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Private Members’ business shall be No. 36, motion re local authority rates (resumed), to conclude at 9 p.m., if not previously concluded.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	What advice?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	120	With regard to the ordering of business, there are reports about propositions being unveiled by the European Commission.  There will be a summit on 9 December.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Could the Deputy raise that when we have addressed the proposals on the Order of Business?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Yes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It is not agreed.  The 19th document laid before the Dáil, as referred to in the Order Paper, is entitled "EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland — Draft Programme Documents, November 2011".  Apparently it has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  It relates to the draft programme that was circulated to German parliamentarians.  I have asked for time to be provided to the House——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	125	We will deal with that issue later.  I have already responded to Deputy Adams.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I oppose the order and, in doing so, am entitled to comment on why.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Only in respect of why there is a time limit on this item.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I oppose that on the basis——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I will allow the Deputy to raise the issue when we deal with the proposal.  The Deputy is now opposing a matter that is ordered in regard to an entirely different matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	130	It does not matter.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	131	It does.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I am entitled to oppose the sequencing of the Order of Business in the House.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	133	In case the Deputy does not realise it, I must inform him that he is not Ceann Comhairle.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I know that.  I am absolutely well aware I am not Ceann Comhairle.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Therefore, if the Deputy wishes to have Standing Orders amended, I suggest that he get his Whip to bring his proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have them debated and brought to the House, at which point we can consider whether they should be changed.  In the meantime, I will apply the rules as they are.  What the Deputy is attempting to do now is totally out of order.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am not attempting to do anything.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The Deputy is attempting to raise another matter which Deputy Adams endeavoured to raise.  Deputy Adams accepted——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I understood Deputy Adams attempted to raise a different matter.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	139	He accepted my position, which is that I must put these proposals first, after which I will deal with matters on the Order of Business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I oppose the order the Ceann Comhairle is putting to me.  My understanding, based on precedent, is that I am entitled to comment on why I oppose the order.  As the leader of an Opposition party, I must state——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	141	There are three proposals.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I asked for section 12 consideration regarding this issue yesterday.  It is unprecedented that documentation would go to German parliamentarians before Irish ones.  I do not have any problem with the concept once we get the documentation first.  I find it extraordinary that we do not even get an opportunity to ask questions about it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	143	The Deputy gets every opportunity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	144	We do not.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	145	We just completed Leaders' Questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	146	It has been snuffed out.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Deputy had an opportunity to——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	148	It has been deliberately suppressed and put down.  We just have not got an opportunity.  Yesterday, I got nothing from the Taoiseach.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Then I suggest that the Deputy change the Standing Orders.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	150	It is not about changing Standing Orders.  I am opposing this order——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Will the Deputy please explain to the House why he is opposing the proposal?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	152	——on the grounds that I would prefer to have time for a session of questions and answers, with either the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach, on the process that led to the documentation going to the German Parliament before it came to the Dáil.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	153	That is not what I am putting to the House.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	163	There is a real problem about the ordering of business here and I am looking for some advice.  For example, the summit on 9 December will consider propositions from the European Commission.  We should have a discussion before that meeting.  I know I can be referred to the Whips and so forth, but I want some handle on this.  There is a real issue with German parliamentarians being able to discuss this matter and we have not yet.  We made a pre-budget submission that was almost fully costed — there were approximately three items for which the Department of Finance would not give us figures.  We sent it to the Minister for Finance and to the Taoiseach.  While we could debate this in Private Members' time, it would be far better if the Government allowed us and the other parties time to discuss these matters and we had a different approach to how a budget is put together.  We should have prior discussions as opposed to discussions when it is a fait accompli.  The Government has such a majority it can just tolerate and then go ahead with what it wants to do.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I call Deputy Martin on a similar issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	167	As I told the Taoiseach yesterday, the House should have an opportunity to discuss that draft programme of budget details that was sent to the German Parliament.  We should have been allowed the opportunity to ask questions on how it got to the German parliamentarians before it was debated properly in this House.  The Minister should have explained it to the House and taken questions on that specific item.  That should have happened and the Taoiseach should have volunteered it.  It has now taken five days to get the documentation placed in the Oireachtas Library.  When I requested that yesterday, the Taoiseach said only that he would consider it and did not have the grace to say he would do that which seemed the obvious course of action.  I am surprised we have not had the opportunity to have that discussion in the House.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I will come back to Deputy Martin.  I call Deputy Boyd Barrett on the same subject.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I also ask that we be given an opportunity to debate the options and issues confronting the people before the budget.  The Taoiseach has indicated that he will make a state of the nation address.  Perhaps these two items could be put together and an address could be made about how the Taoiseach sees the issues facing the Government before the budget and the questions that will influence how the Government will approach the budget.  Opposition parties should have the opportunity to outline their views about options and alternatives facing into the budget.  Particularly given the number of kites being flown and the fear and anxiety being caused to ordinary people, it is only fair, reasonable and democratic to have a debate in the Dáil in which people can set out their perspectives on how we can deal with the economic crisis and the severe issues facing the country in advance of the final budget announcements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	170	As is now normal procedure, we like to have discussions or comments from the Members of the House before European Council meetings and after.  That is a change that was introduced since the Government was formed.  In this case the budget will be on 6 December and I need to attend an EPP meeting in Marseilles on 7 December before the meeting in Brussels.  We will need to make arrangements for the forthcoming Council meeting to be held on 9 December sometime before that.  I will see that happens in accordance with the established practice we have.Deputy Martin asked how the material got to the German parliamentary committee.  He will be aware that as part of the troika, the Commission has to get the documentation about the previous quarter in order that it can sign off on it and approve the further moneys for Ireland under the bailout programme.  Because the budget is so close, it sought information about the intentions of the Minister for Finance in this regard and that was sent to the Commission in confidence.  It has admitted it should not have sent that to the German Parliament's budget committee.  That was sent in confidence given the proximity of the budget.  It is duty bound to send the other material — the assessment for the preceding quarter — to the German parliamentary committee, because it is now inserted into the German constitution that it must be so informed.  However, it was not bound to send the information about the general intentions of the Minister for Finance about our budget, which is our business here.  It has admitted its fault in that.  So it is not necessary to have an investigation to find out what happened.  We now know what happened and the Commission clarified it was wrong.  As I have said, the Minister for Finance has protested very strongly about a breach of confidentiality to Commissioner Rehn in that regard.  The material was sent in confidence because of the proximity of the budget.In regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's comment, he will obviously have plenty of time during the budget discussions.  I suggest that he work with his colleagues on the other side of the House.  He can use Private Members' time and I will see what other opportunities might be found for having discussions about the general financial situation.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The annual fishing opportunities for the Community's fishing fleets are traditionally agreed at the December Fisheries Council.  This year the arrangements for 2012 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled to take place on 15 and 16 December.  The process of preparing for the Council is well under way, with the publication of the European Commission's policy statement last May and its detailed proposals in September for fishing levels of key stocks of interest to Ireland.  The details of the proposals are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, and also take account of the views of the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF.In May the European Commission issued a policy statement which outlined its intention to simplify the process for determining fishing levels by reducing the number of guideline rules from 11 to just three as follows: category 1 — where there is an agreed management plan in existence, follow it; category 2 — where there is no plan, apply the maximum sustainable yield, MSY, approach; and category 3 — if there is no population estimate, reduce the TAC by 25%, which is referred to as the precautionary approach.  This approach applied a 25% cut in the TAC to any stock for which ICES did not present a forecast.  Unsurprisingly, this approach has not received much support from member states.  In response, the Commission, in its proposal for fishing opportunities, released in late September, moderated its position on category 3 as follows: 3.1, Data Poor 1, where ICES advises no increase or a reduction in catches on the basis of some analyses, apply 15% cut to the TAC; and 3.2, Data Poor 2, where ICES advises no increase or a reduction in catches on the basis of lack of data, apply a 25% cut to the TAC.The October Fisheries Council in Luxembourg considered TAC and quota proposals for the Baltic Sea.  In that context and in response to concerns other colleagues and I had expressed about the overall policy being pursued, Commissioner Damanaki gave a commitment to rethink her previously stated policy of applying automatic reductions of 15% or 25% to a swathe of stocks in the absence of full scientific advice.  The European Commission now appears receptive to examining the scientific advice on a case by case basis which I have advocated for some time.  The Commissioner, however, has stated she intends to implement, as a matter of principle, a level of cut to all stocks without full scientific advice, regardless of the indications in respect of available data and advice.Turning to the national stage, the programme for Government gives a commitment that a sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment, based on consultation with all major stakeholders, will be brought before the Dáil annually before EU fisheries negotiations commence.  This is an innovative step and a signal from the Government of the importance it places on the economic viability of the seafood industry and the well-being of the wider marine ecosystem around the shoreline.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, I initiated a consultation process, whereby stakeholders were asked to comment on the European Commission's proposals for fishing opportunities in 2012.  On 10 October an online web portal, www.fishingnet.ie, was activated to enable electronic submissions to be forwarded for consideration and this facility remained open until 28 October.  In addition, on 18 October I chaired a meeting of stakeholders to further assist and inform consideration of the proposals and the submission of comments.An analysis of the various contributions made to the consultation process shows a general welcome for the early publication of the European Commission's proposals and an acknowledgement that the new national consultative process was a positive addition to the debate surrounding fishing opportunities and the interactions of fisheries policy with the wider environment.  The balance of the contributions indicates a need for greater adherence to the scientific advice available to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be made.  This is necessary to provide for sustainable fish stocks and support the viability of the fishing industry, while also protecting the broader marine ecosystem.There were, however, criticisms expressed, which I share, regarding the arbitrary cuts proposed by the European Commission for fishing opportunities in 2012 and the narrow view taken on the scientific advice, or its absence in certain cases.  There was concern that the cuts in quotas, particularly where the available science was showing a healthy or increasing biomass for some stocks, would lead to further unnecessary discards.With regard to the conclusions of the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment, it is important to note the expert contributions of the Marine Institute and Bord lascaigh Mhara, BIM, which formed an integral part of the findings.  It is also important to note that the European Commission's proposal being considered is the only proposal for certain fishing opportunities in 2012 not subject to third party agreements.  This includes mainly whitefish stocks and does not cover some pelagic stocks, such as mackerel, which is Ireland's most important stock in economic terms, horse mackerel, or albacore tuna.What comes across loud and clear is that managing fisheries is a complex undertaking, more so in the context of mixed fisheries, which is the nature of the fisheries in the waters around Ireland, particularly in the whitefish sector.  It is also clear that the Irish fishing fleets depend on healthy and sustainable stocks for their medium and long-term viability and that many of the stocks on which they depend are not in a healthy biological state, and are in need of urgent remedial action and protection, when and where appropriate.I do not intend to go into a stock by stock discussion, although if Members have questions on specific recommendations, I will try to answer them.  Members should examine the data that accompanies the impact assessment that has been produced by the Marine Institute, in particular the stock book, which I launched this morning and which goes through the state of Irish stocks, stock by stock.  It is an excellent piece of work and I do not believe it is matched by any other country in the EU in terms of its level of detail.I have consistently stated that wherever the scientific advice indicates a need for a cut in TAC levels, I will accept this measure.  The impact assessment itself agrees with the need to cut the quotas for some of the stocks in 2012, although the level of these cuts is queried in some cases, while in others there is clear scientific data to suggest a cut is unwarranted.  In other cases, the available evidence is that an increase in the TAC can be more than justified.  Indeed, for one stock, the impact assessment goes against the norm in its assertion that the proposed increase by the Commission in TAC for Celtic Sea herring is actually too high and a lower TAC increase would be more appropriate for the longer-term stability of the stock.  This has been agreed by the industry, which is a very responsible approach.The major bone of contention is the Commission's insistence on only using some of the scientific data that is available and how it interprets this.  I appreciate that the Commissioner has indicated a willingness to move from the Commission's original position and take account of all available advice which generates estimates of future catches and historical trends of landings and effort.  However, it is unclear how this will impact on individual stocks.  Indeed, in some cases this additional advice indicates healthy biomass levels, which we want to insist the Commission takes into account when making final recommendations.From a broader perspective, as I have previously stated, Ireland is committed to having total allowable catches set at levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield, MSY, by 2015, when and where possible.  The philosophy behind this approach is to obtain the maximum long-term catch, while simultaneously ensuring the stock size is kept large enough to maintain productivity.  However, I stress that the transition from the current management framework to a framework based on MSY will need to be on a phased basis.  Where we have the necessary scientific advice from ICES, I will be supportive of establishing TACs for 2012 to ensure that we are delivering MSY for these stocks by 2015.  In this way, the transition to MSY will take account of the socioeconomic impacts through reduced catches in the short term.  The benefit of an MSY approach is that, in the longer term, we will deliver more stable and sustainable fisheries for our industry.However, there are considerable implementing challenges with MSY which will require further consideration and a rational and pragmatic approach.  The issue of delivering MSY for stocks which are "data poor" is a real issue.  For example, the sole and plaice in fisheries off the west coast are so small that it would not be economically reasonable to do a comprehensive scientific sampling programme, as is done for the large commercial stocks such as cod.  There are also challenges in regard to delivering MSY in mixed fisheries that require careful consideration.  These issues will be considered in the context of the reform of the CFP discussions over the coming year.  However, for 2012 it will be important to make decisions on TACs based on best available data.As I said, managing fishing out-take in a mixed fisheries scenario is a complex matter.  The real concern is that decisions taken for a reduction in the TAC for a single stock may result in increased levels of discards for that stock where it is a by-catch in other fisheries.  The ICES advice has clearly highlighted the importance of introducing additional technical measures for many of the mixed whitefish stocks around our coast so that juvenile fish, in particular, are allowed to escape.  We are making good progress in regard to some of the fisheries on that count.Ireland has been to the fore in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards, as evidenced most recently when I launched the Irish "discards atlas", a detailed description of discards by the Irish fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The atlas also outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discards and to make fishing more targeted in terms of the stocks they are targeting.  The atlas was compiled to inform an EU-wide debate on discards, to which it will make a significant contribution in the context of the CAP.  I thank the Marine Institute for the phenomenal level of detail it put into that report.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	203	In that case, I will leave the detail of my speech for Members to read and I will make some general comments.  We have a number of concerns in regard to the Commission's new approach.  The Commission wants to take a precautionary approach whereby it deems there is insufficient data available and wants to apply automatic cuts of somewhere between 15% and 25%.  In this impact assessment, we make the point that we can provide data and reasonable information on trends that in some cases actually suggest the stock is not under pressure.  In those instances, we will insist the Commission takes on board the data that is available to make an educated decision in terms of the health of fish stocks and issues such as fishing effort and TACs for certain stocks next year.Much of the ICES and Marine Institute data is highly credible and is accepted by the Commission.  The view that we should be taking decisions on the basis of scientific advice is one that needs to be adopted whether it represents good or bad news for fishermen.  In many of the smaller fisheries, we might have an indication that the fishery is remaining consistent and there is no evidence to suggest it is under pressure, which can be measured by landings, the size of fish being landed and so on.  While that data may not be sufficient to put in place a maximum sustainable yield policy, it still gives us a good indication of the health of the stock.  We should be making our decisions based on the data that is available, of which there is a huge amount.  The stock book which we launched this morning is the equivalent of a fish bible in terms of its level of detail.I thank the Marine Institute for helping to prepare me to make arguments based on science rather than based on emotion, so we can get the best possible deal to protect stocks and, indeed, maintain a viable commercial fishery in the fisheries where that makes sense for next year.  If Members have comments, I will take them on board.  They may have specific questions and I understand we will have some 20 minutes for questions at the end of the debate.

It is beneficial to discuss this industry which is of major importance to the Irish economy and plays an essential role in coastal communities.  It generates more than €800 million and provides employment for 11,000 people.  While it is important to talk about the sustainability of stocks, it is equally important to recognise the importance of the sustainability of fishery families around our coastline.  The Minister must strike a balance in his discussions in Brussels between protecting the livelihoods of fishing families and protecting stocks.We have a sustainable fishery industry and many fishermen have taken many hard decisions in recent years with the downsizing of the fishery fleet and fishermen having to work against the severe background of a lack of stocks and quotas but they have managed to survive.  I speak to fishermen in Kilmore, Duncannon and along the Wexford coastline on a regular basis and I am sure other Deputies do likewise.  We all recognise the importance of having a viable fishing industry.  The programme for Government, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined, committed to introducing a sustainable fisheries impact assessment annually before the EU fishery meetings.  I attended many of those meetings when I was in the Department in previous years and, to a certain extent, many of the decisions are made at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. following heavy negotiations over two or three days.  I am sure the Minister will be at the coalface with his counterparts in other member states making sure that Ireland's fishery quotas are protected for 2012.How many other countries carry out a sustainable fisheries impact assessment prior to the December negotiations?  Are we showing our hand early in this case compared to other countries?  From my experience, many of the decisions on the reductions of quotas or on what would suit Irish fishermen were taken at the eleventh hour of the discussions.  I welcome the fact that we are having this debate today.I am sure the proposals from the European Commission in September set alarm bells ringing in the fishing industry.  I welcome the fact the Minister had productive debates with the stakeholders, although from talking to members of fishery organisations throughout the country I know they are concerned about the proposals and what decisions will be taken for Ireland at the final negotiations.The European Commission proposals refer to an arbitrary 25% cut in stocks which do not have complete data and full scientific advice available.  As the Minister said, much of this is based on precautionary operations within the Commission and by the Commissioner.  That may not be a good enough way to operate because those kinds of precautionary approaches will eventually affect how fishermen will survive in 2012.  I accept that the Marine Institute is providing strong scientific data and doing its best in this area.  I understand in the region of €26 million was spent in 2010 on data collection for quota stocks, some of which will have come from the EU.  Will the Minister make increased funding available for 2012?  I know this is a difficult time in his Department but will he make increased funding available for the Marine Institute to provide increased scientific data for 2012 to enable him to make more definite decisions in the future and, more importantly, to prove to the EU that we have a strong scientific basis for many of the arguments we put forward at EU level?  Other reasons that scientists cannot perform robust stock assessments are related to complex problems such as historical data, length of time series and lack of coherence in assessment data.Of the 24 stocks of interest to Ireland, all bar four are seeing significant cuts in the amount available to Irish fishermen.  The cuts range from 15% and 25% for most stocks to a recommended zero quota for cod in the Irish Sea off the Donegal coast.  It is important to recognise that such cuts will have severe implications for fishermen around our coastline.  I expect the Minister will not accept such cuts when the serious negotiations commence in December.  I am sure he and his officials will argue strongly for a serious reduction in what the Commissioner proposes.We must also recognise the good news, namely, that increases are proposed for cod and herring in the Celtic Sea with a 25% increase in haddock in the north west.  This is a result of conservation programmes for cod and herring in the Celtic Sea put in place primarily by the industry.  It is important to note that the industry in recent years has recognised the need for conservation and to protect stocks and quotas.  It has played its part but from talking to members of the fishery organisations I know they feel that they did not get any thanks for doing this especially when the Commission has put forward an arbitrary 25% cut in stocks and seems not to recognise that the fishermen have put conservation at the top of their agenda.  We have a strong fishery organisation and strong groups that link into it.  They told me they have gone into serious detail on the proposed cuts with the Minister and the Department and they believe there is no justification for the cuts that have been put forward by the Commission.  The Minister, when responding, might give more detail on his discussions with them.Fishermen face many reductions and difficulties in trying to earn a living.  Haddock fishing in the south west and whiting fishing in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast are closed and quotas for many species are heavily restricted.  It is nearly impossible to keep the Irish fleet in business but I recognise it has played its part in trying to ensure we have a viable fishing industry.  I am sure the Minister will continue to support the fishery industry to sustain a viable industry for fishery families around our coastline.The Minister has to strike a balance between the sustainability of stocks and the substantiality of Irish fishermen.  That is what it is all about.  Previous ministers in their discussions in Brussels in December have tried to strike that balance.  It is not always possible to get 100% of what one seeks because the European Commission will always try to balance it out but it is important that the livelihoods of fishery families in Ireland are protected.  They have suffered greatly in recent years and it is only right that the Minister will be at the coalface in Brussels arguing their case and I am sure he will do that.I wish to ask the Minister about the inshore fisheries framework.  He spoke about what was contained in the programme for Government and I heard him on numerous occasions speak about the development of the inshore fisheries framework.  There is tremendous opportunity for development and expansion in this area but there is a serious lack of management in it.  It is hard for us to make our own decisions outside the 12 mile limit but certainly what happens inside the 12 mile and six mile limit is totally a matter for the Minister and his Department.Providing for proper management of the inshore fisheries framework is a matter for the Department and the Minister and I hope he will do so as quickly as possible.I raise the issue of Bord Iascaigh Mhara being moved to within the Department.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced this would happen.

It does tremendous work and it is important that this be recognised.  It has a major role to play in the development of the fishing industry.Because I was a Minister of State in the Department, a number of fishermen have raised with me the closure of the ice plant in Dingle last August.  When will it reopen?  It is very important that it be reopened as quickly as possible.  I do not know why it closed.  I do not know whether it was closed by the Minister or the Department.  Fishermen tell me that under Fianna Fáil they, at least, had ice, but under Fine Gael they have none.

It is important that the Minister put the gloves on when he travels to Brussels in December.  Many decisions are made on the margins.  I will not state they are made through wheeling and dealing but through dialogue and discussion with countries also concerned about huge cuts in quotas and the effect they will have on fishermen.  I am sure the Minister will argue the case for Ireland.  He has stated many of the proposals made are not acceptable, which is a good start.I compliment the Minister on raising the discards issue which has been highlighted in recent months in a number of radio and television programmes which featured discussions on how they could be eliminated.  It is welcome that the Minister launched the discards atlas.  While I know he will encounter some opposition in the European Union, it is good that the Department and the Government are leading the charge in this area.  I hope the Minister will be successful.I wish the Minister all the best in the discussions in Brussels in December and hope he will be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome for fishermen who have suffered greatly in recent years.  They are very important in coastal communities.  We are aware of the numbers of jobs in companies which operate in Castletownbere, Kilmore Quay, Donegal, Dingle and other locations and know of the commitment of fishermen to the economy.  There are still tremendous opportunities to further develop the fishing industry by adding value to products, many of which are being exported without value being added.  This is of concern and needs to be examined.  In the programme for Government the Minister committed to the development of certain areas in the sector.With regard to aquaculture, there is a serious lack of product throughout the European Union.  There is, therefore, a tremendous opportunity to develop the aquaculture industry.  How will the Minister deal with the licensing of existing aquaculture companies and possible new ones in 2012?  What progress is he making on this issue?
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	213	It is good to have an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Minister.There are two aspects to sustainability — the sustainability of fish stocks and the sustainability of the fishing industry.  Three fundamental facts need to be taken into account in this regard: fish do not provide an infinite source of food for Ireland, Europe or the world; fishing practices, protocols and quotas have an impact, good or bad, on stock levels; and, from the perspective of the Government and the people, particularly those involved in the industry here, the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, has been and is deeply damaging to our interests.  This final point is the one on which there seems to be resistance on the part of the Government.The CFP represents a very bad deal for the country.  Some claim we cannot renegotiate it, but I disagree.  In any case, it needs to be stated it has been a bad deal.  We should use this fact as a fulcrum to increase Ireland's share of the overall EU CFP quota.  Unless the Government begins to take this approach in negotiations, we will tinker at the edges of what is a very flawed policy which is damaging to the country's interests and the interests of those engaged in fishing.  We could increase the share of the quota for the fishing industry to promote its future development and growth, while at the same time reducing the overall fish take in our waters.  We may have missed opportunities in this regard in the past.  It is ironic to hear Fianna Fáil speak about a bad deal being done because it had many opportunities to renegotiate and put on the boxing gloves, to quote the previous speaker, to fight for Ireland, but it did not do so.  However, it is not too late to do so.Approximately 5,000 people are directly or indirectly employed or employed on a seasonal basis in processing.  That is not an insignificant figure, but it could be far greater if Irish fishermen had a fairer share of the catch in Irish waters and if there was more processing of the fish caught in our waters in this country.  The potential of processing to add value to the fish landed here and aquacultural products is illustrated by the fact that the value of fish landed is doubled when processed.  However, the vast majority of the fish caught off our shores are landed and processed abroad.  We have, in effect, handed over a massively valuable natural resource which potentially will be under threat if the same system of management — or mismanagement — is allowed to continue in place and unless we regain sovereign control.  That is impossible, however, at the current time due to the straitjacket of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Indeed, the processing industry based on the Irish catch faces the same threat of being run down or even closed down.  Fishermen agree that levels are dangerously low for some stocks but they disagree about the cause.  To a certain extent, what is happening under the CFP is a bit like our economic situation — those who caused the damage are not being penalised.  The small guy and his family on the shoreline who is trying to earn a living from the fishing industry is being hurt over this.There has been some recognition of this injustice by some EU states but Ministers have also admitted that this State has received no support with regard to addressing the fundamental issue of the quota.  The overall impression is of this State constantly having to fight a rear guard action to preserve whatever crumbs have been thrown our way.  That in itself is reason enough, as one of the significant stakeholders in the sector, to demand that the policy is reformed in such a way as to ensure the interests of Irish fishermen are protected and enhanced.It is significant that at the same time as this State was negotiating entry to the EU, so also was Norway.  The CFP was drawn up during the talks as a means of allowing "equal access" to British and Irish waters for the fishing fleets of the then six member states — Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.  The Norwegians sensibly decided that such a sacrifice of their national asset was not worth it.  They still have a thriving fishing sector.The harm done by the CFP is generally recognised.  In 2002, the review group which reported to the Forum on Europe referred to the "inequalities and injustices" inherent in the CFP.  Perhaps it best summed up the situation when it declared that "Ireland has only a small piece of its own cake".The 2004 estimate of the catch by the Irish fleet in waters around our coast was that it amounted to 15% of the total catch.  Within the area under EU jurisdiction it was only 28%.  In the same year it was estimated by the Marine Institute that the value of the catch in surrounding waters was €800 million of which €460 million was taken in the EU zone.EUROSTAT statistics place the accumulated processed value of fish taken in Irish waters between 1974 and 2004 at around €200 billion.  That is five times the value of the total transfer funds we received from the EU, mainly in CAP and structural funding, over the same period.Had our fisheries been properly managed and developed under domestic control, they might have become a valuable resource that could have played a vital role in the economic development of the country.  Instead the Irish fishery was squandered and is currently in mortal danger.  Many believe, with some justification, that EU policy is deliberately designed to reduce the Irish fishing sector to insignificance, thus making it easier for the larger players to take over this business.What is worse is that the intent of Brussels is being reinforced by the actions of the Irish State and its enforcement authorities.  This is illustrated by the manner in which the sector is policed under legislative changes to both the Criminal Justice Act and the Sea Fisheries Act which, in effect, criminalised fishermen in a manner not applied to any other economic sector.  The Minister's party and the Labour Party opposed this when in opposition.  They promised to replace the criminal sanctions with administrative measures, so I trust this will be followed through.  I expect it will be.Another area relevant to the sustainability of fish stocks around our coast is the level of illegal fishing.  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that this is as much as one third of the value of the entire legal catch in Irish waters, but that could be a gross under-estimation.  The reason why it is hard to come up with an accurate estimate concerns the inadequate policing of Irish waters and foreign vessels there, in particular.Irish fishermen believe they unjustly bear the brunt of fisheries protection surveillance and that, in any event, this State does not have the necessary resources to monitor the non-Irish fleet adequately.  Nor does it seem that the states from which those vessels originate are particularly concerned about what their boats do while in Irish waters.There is undoubtedly an issue regarding the sustainability of Irish fish stocks.  Consequently, we need to take measures to ensure that those stocks do not reach a critically low level.  Unfortunately, some people, including some of those who have made submissions, appear to take EU statistics at face value.  They do not factor in the economic, social and national interest issues at stake in the fisheries sector, not just for Ireland but also for other member states.It would be possible to balance both measures — fish stocks and economic sustainability — to protect stocks and reallocate quotas to ensure that Irish fisheries can survive and prosper.  A number of key issues must take centre stage in the forthcoming negotiations.  The Government must argue for a fundamental reform of the CFP to address inequitable distribution of quota and lack of national control.  We must increase quota for Irish fishermen.  EU member states have to understand that the original assignation was wrong, unfair and should not have been agreed by any Irish negotiating team.The Minister needs to put the case for less centralised control, not more of it.  Irish fisheries ought, to the greatest extent possible, be administered from this country and not from Brussels.  I know the Minister will take this approach in the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, and I agree fully with him.  The Irish Government knows better what is best for Irish waters than any central European system.There needs to be more consultation with the real stakeholders who are the fishermen, processors and others involved economically in the harbour-side of the industry.  Their economic future is tied up in this sector.I understand there are proposals to restrict Irish fishermen further, including the use of satellites to monitor small fishing boats, but the Minister should reject such proposals.  It might seem like a sensible thing to do but it would simply add to the suspicion that Europe is intent on creating a hostile environment designed to drive fishermen out of the sector.Those are the issues I wished to raise in this debate.  Will the Minister negotiate upwards the quota for Irish fishermen at December's Fisheries Council meeting?  How much input did fishermen and others involved in the industry have to the agreed management plan, to which the Minister referred?I wish to echo the commendation of the Minister's stance on discards, which is both sensible and reasonable.

I thank the Minister for giving us a chance to address this important issue.  The Common Fisheries Policy is widely accepted as having failed.  The policy deliberately set out to hamper and destroy the Irish fishing industry.  It has been said by other speakers that prior to our entry into the European Economic Community, EEC, the rules were changed to ensure equal access to all fisheries waters within the European Union after we joined.  That left us at a very severe disadvantage, and even at that stage we were unable to negotiate around fisheries because our team was told that if it wanted to discuss fisheries, all the talks would be called off.  We are living with that legacy from over 40 years ago, as the EEC, as it was, set out deliberately to steal the resources of a so-called member or partner state in the Community that was established.Every year we discuss the issue and the total allowable catch, TAC, in December in Brussels, and that legacy continues to place a stranglehold on the Irish fishing industry.  I often wonder what the west coast of Ireland would have looked like if over the past 40 years we had equal access and a fair share, or if the European Community looked to develop smaller nations and allowed them to reach their full potential.  We would not have had the unbalanced development we had, where Dublin now holds almost half the population of the country.  Instead, we would have had a vibrant west coast rather than an area which is in decline and suffering depopulation.Fishing in Donegal is not only an economic activity but it is also a way of life.  It is central to the identity and prosperity of Killybegs, where I come from, which is 85% dependent on fishing for employment.  Every other coastal community has an equal dependence.  The seafood industry here employs almost 12,000 people and contributed more than €700 million to the economy last year.  Fishing communities are located in all our most disadvantaged areas, and anything we can do to develop and grow the industry will lead to increased employment in those areas.The European Commission has presented its proposals for the 2012 fishing opportunities for certain stocks in the Atlantic and the North Sea.  The total allowable catch for some stocks, such as monkfish and Celtic Sea cod, herring, haddock, sole and megrim could possibly be increased.  It is a different story in area 6A, west of Scotland, and in the Irish Sea, where the Commission proposes that no fishing will take place in 2012.  There has been a ban in place for area 6A since 2009 in an attempt to protect cod, haddock and whiting.  It has effectively banned the use of most fishing gears in area 6A, with the exception of very specific tall gears only.  That has forced small inshore fleets to concentrate solely on crab and lobster, which will in time put those stocks under pressure.  This decision did not take into account that the inshore fleet catches little or no cod but it has severely inhibited a fisherman's ability to survive.  It places their way of life at risk in coastal communities and particularly in the island communities in Donegal.Will the Minister seriously examine management arrangements within the six mile limit and use his powers to exert our national control over these areas?  That would ensure that small inshore fleets can be sustainable and provide a way of life, as they have done for many years in local communities.In the proposal it is stated by the Commission that poor data hampers the management of stocks and despite successive cuts in total allowable catches over the years, the stock still appears to be falling in area 6A.  For stocks where data is too poor to estimate a size properly, the Commission has applied a so-called precautionary principle, reducing TACs by 25% initially, although this has since been moderated to between 15% and 25% until more reliable data is made available.  What steps are being taken to deduce the stock position?  Irish fishermen are extremely annoyed that quotas on a range of species, including hake and prawns, are being cut by up to 25% despite the Commission not having sufficient information on their state.  The proposals from the European Commission are not based on science but on a policy paper issued by the EU earlier this year indicating that quota proposals would be based on a categorisation which Europe had made.  This means that where there is insufficient information, the quotas will be cut severely.The Commission's stated goal is to set TACs at science-based levels, which help recover stocks and make fisheries sustainable in the long term.  Fishermen have always had doubts about the science used and the Minister has recently stated the current fiscal position is placing limitations on the amount of research that can be carried out.  How can we have faith in the science as a result?  We need a commitment to ensure that adequate research will take place along the west coast.  The recent report on the mapping of discards is good and comprehensive but the Marine Institute admits that even with that, only 1% of catches were analysed.  It is very difficult to get accurate figures for discards.The mapping document for discards concluded that approximately 38% of fish caught off the north coast of Ireland is discarded because the fish are too small to sell or banned by the EU from being landed.  The Commission wants to ban discards completely by 2015 but this should only be done by introducing technical measures such as selective gear and gear that allows juvenile fish to escape.  Areas should be closed effectively at spawning times.  Only when such measures are in place can every fish caught be landed.  A system that penalises fishermen for landing fish that they do not have a quota for will not work and only a system that allows those fish to be sold and consumed will be effective.  Otherwise, discarding will be forced underground and there will be illegal dumping of fish at sea.

The discussion is somewhat lopsided by the fact that we are straitjacketed within the Common Fisheries Policy.  I agree with the Deputies who said this has been an absolute disaster for Ireland and that we must examine our fisheries completely rather than tinkering with quotas within the confines of that policy.  Comparisons with Norway are appropriate as it is an example of how a country maintained control to the benefit of society as a whole.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The discussion must be seen in the context of the depletion of the fishing resources and the destruction of fishing communities.  There are serious issues which are clearly problems for society but not confined to Ireland.  On the global scale there is a rapid depletion of marine fish, with 75% of major fisheries either fully exploited, over-exploited or depleted.  On the other hand there has been a massive assault on the livelihoods of ordinary fishermen, and there are now over 1 million vessels fishing on the world's oceans.  Many family trawlers and smaller fishing enterprises have been driven out.  We know the dangerous nature of a fishing lifestyle and two men in my constituency lost their lives earlier this year.  For smaller and medium fishing enterprises and those with family trawlers, it is becoming harder every day.There has been erosion of the smaller harbours and a consequent impact on local communities.  That is particularly true in my area with the harbours in Balbriggan, Rush, Loughshinny and Skerries, all of which are in tatters or a bad state of disrepair.  They are under the administration of the local authority, which has given no money for improvements or remedial works.  Generations have fished in these areas and now Balbriggan operates with 16 boats.  At one time Skerries was one of the leading harbours in Ireland but now it only has four boats.  These issues are putting our fishing communities under threat, and that is made worse by prices paid by supermarkets etc.Quota size is important but the issue of transference of fishing concessions is still live; that must be introduced to the debate.  That is nothing more than extending neoliberalism into every aspect of life.  The Minister previously indicated that this is the privatisation of fishing quotas in Ireland even further, which will reduce the fleet as there is no doubt that the big boys will move in to buy the quota, putting smaller fishing enterprises out of business.  It would mark the death knell of many of the small harbours dotted around our coast.  There will not be a single harbour operating in north County Dublin if that transference goes ahead.Other Deputies have pointed out that there have been few economic benefits from the way fisheries are managed relative to what we should have.  Nearly all those benefits would be lost to large European conglomerates which would buy up the quotas at a cost of thousands of jobs and a major impact on the economy.  That is a serious threat but it is not idle; it happened in Africa when countries were forced to sell their fishing rights.  The result has been a decrease of approximately 50% in Africa's fish population.  Many fishermen have lost their jobs.  That is the backdrop to this discussion which must be factored in, namely, the acceleration of the process where the small fisherman is thrown to the side and the big factory trawlers are still ruling the roost.  In that context the overall Common Fisheries Policy needs to be examined rather than just the area of quotas.

Both of their arguments seem plausible and the Minister must try to reconcile them.I was briefed on the issue by one Minister who was in the Department.  He suggested a few points which are important in terms of the global outlook of the fishing industry.  The first point is to ask why there is not a fisheries Ministry.  The Minister who spoke to me said there was enough work in the area to keep him fully occupied as a Minister of State in the Department and that fisheries tended to be neglected as an important part of the Irish industrial landscape because it is lumped in with agriculture, which in itself is a job for the senior Minister.  It appears that fisheries have been neglected by successive Ministers because it has been lumped in with agriculture and the marine.The Minister will be aware that a marine co-ordination group was examining fisheries under the previous Government.  A group of Secretaries General of various Departments were involved.  The group was set up to break through the bureaucracy that has cursed the industry.  I wonder if it is still active.

I am delighted the Minister has replied to the question.The Minister may have addressed the second point in his opening speech but I did not hear him; it relates to the licensing of bays and whether it is still producing a formidable delay to the development of the fishing industry, in particular shellfish.The big question is one which I cannot resolve but which the Minister is probably at pains to resolve, namely, the problem of over-fishing.  I was impressed by what Deputy Pringle said about that.  In an amateur way I was also impressed by a briefing I received from the Pew Environment Group.  The argument is that scientific limits, which appear to be totally arbitrary, are pretty well ignored.  It seems that the figures for the EU limits, with which I presume the Minister is familiar, are breached by approximately 48%.  They go above the scientific limit.  The scientific limits do not seem to matter at all.  Approximately 70% of the assessed stock is over-fished by the industry.The other matter on which I would like the Minister to respond is the World Bank report.  It was called something quite obscure such as, The Sunken Billions.  It is a dramatic report which indicates that over-fishing globally costs approximately $50 billion per annum.Subsidies appear to be a thorny subject, particularly from the European Union.  Figures kindly provided to me by Deputy Pringle indicate that the European Union is paying tens of millions of euro in fishing subsidies to countries that have neither fishing fleets nor even a coastline, and that landlocked countries such as Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic shared a sum of more than €20 million in a single year despite none of them landing any fish according to a report from the environmental group, Oceana, into the scandal of EU fisheries.There are other instances of subsidies being almost inexplicable.  A total of approximately €13 million was distributed by the European Union to modernise fishing fleets between 1994 and 2006 with a further €130 million paid out to owners to scrap the same vessels.  In one case a Spanish owner was given a €1,000 subsidy for improvements to his trawler and then just 17 days later he was handed €26,000 to dispose of the same boat.Spain is the biggest beneficiary of EU fishing subsidies, pocketing more than €5 billion in grants since 2000.  This sum is about a third of the fishing aid spent across the EU and accounts for almost a third of the value of the fishing industry.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	230	We are now moving to questions and answers.  Deputy Joe McHugh will ask the first question.  We will take questions in groups of two.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the fact that the Commission appears to be receptive to looking at the scientific advices on a case-by-case basis.  It is a difficult task especially in mixed fisheries.I am aware that the Minister is working closely with stakeholders.  Anecdotally, there is a view among fishermen that certain stocks are replenishing.  I refer to hake, haddock and, in some cases, cod.  What measures or interventions are possible from BIM and the Marine Institute in terms of them becoming involved in collecting more data in consultation with stakeholders and fishermen to see how much stocks are replenishing?Specific talks are taking place at the moment.  I met fishermen in my constituency and I am sure Deputy Pringle has met some in his constituency also who did not take the money in the buy-out salmon scheme.  They understood that if they were to take the money  they would not be allowed to fish again.  I accept the buy-out scheme for those with salmon fishing licences was offered under a different Department.  Would the Minister consider examining the potential for fishermen who did not take up the buy-out scheme, who now find themselves in that situation, to consider facilitating them in the shellfish industry?  I accept we are crossing from one Department to another.  I accept also that there are not many fishermen in that situation but they were of the belief that they would not be allowed to fish again.  Perhaps we should offer some facility to help them enter the shellfish industry.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I wish to raise the issue of prawn fishery, which is a sustainable fishery.  I understand we have a 9,000 tonne quota but we will only catch 3,000 tonnes this year because of the cod recovery plan.  Could the Minister comment on how we might get around that problem?My other question relates to prawn fishing in the Porcupine Bank.  Does the Minister intend to remove the separate quota that was introduced this year and allow the seasonal closure put in place previously by the industry, which was working very well, to do its job?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	233	A series of questions was asked during the contributions.  Does the Acting Chairman wish me to address them now as well?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Minister should use the time as expeditiously as possible because there are three more questions to follow.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	235	In reply to Deputy McHugh's questions, as he indicated, the salmon buy-out scheme is under a different Department and even if I wanted to change the rules to allow people to catch salmon again commercially I would not be able to do that without getting agreement from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  We are always open to looking at new ways of creating viable businesses for coastal communities but salmon fishing will be difficult.  There is nothing to prevent someone from entering the shellfish sector.  If he or she wants to apply for a licence, there is a mechanism for doing this.  We have put in place a template for shellfish aquaculture licences.Other Deputies asked questions about aquaculture licences.  We are working through the frustrating process of having to undertake an environmental impact assessment of all Natura scheme bays, the bays around the coast designated as special areas of conservation by the European Union.  This must be done before we can consider licence applications in these bays.  That process is well under way and we will have completed the assessment of four or five bays by the end of the year and will be accepting aquaculture licence applications as soon as possible after that date.A number of Deputies asked about the collection of data.  When the European Commissioner came to Ireland recently, she made a point of outlining how impressed she was by the level of data collection here, the people in the Marine Institute and the accuracy and credibility of its technology.  Anyone who reads the Stock Book which assesses fish stocks in various areas will see that our capacity to collect data and make a credible argument based on science, to which the industry and the scientists in the Marine Institute have contributed, is better than that of any other country in the European Union.  That is our starting point.  If we need to build and improve on this, we should try to do so, but we are starting from a good place.  When I entered politics, there was considerable friction between the fishing industry and scientists in the Marine Institute with regard to the facts.  We have come a long way since and it has been a positive development.Deputy Ross spoke about the Sunken Billions report.  The title refers to income that will be lost to the fishery sector if we do not implement a maximum sustainable yield approach to stock management.  The report outlines the precautionary approach we need to take to ensure we will have viable fish stocks.  Otherwise we will lose billions of euro of potential revenue.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I suggest a couple of questions from Deputies might open the thinking processes.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I will bunch the questions together in answering them.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Noel Harrington, to be followed by Deputies Mick Wallace and Brendan Griffin.  There will then be two more questioners.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I wish the Minister and his officials the best in the Council negotiations in the middle of December.  I am sure he will do his best for the country and the fishing industry.Will the Minister consider helping small inshore island fisheries, given that the pelagic catch is small, sporadic and seasonal?  These fishermen are always looking over their shoulders with regard to enforcement.  It is a traditional fishery and probably the most sustainable, in terms of catch, effort and power.  It should be maintained.In the light of this year's successful figures for the tuna fishery, will the Minister consider fighting for an increased total allowable catch, TAC, for albacore tuna in the coming season?  We have not had such a good tuna catch for some years and our TAC of tuna has gone down because of this.  We were considerably more successful this year.A sustainability policy requires enforcement in respect of our own and visiting fleets.  Will the Minister make a statement on the introduction of electronic log books to underpin enforcement measures and the sustainability of our fisheries?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I probably know less about fish than Deputy Ross, although I love to eat all kinds of fish.  As long as it is dead, I will eat it.I am amazed by the discarding of fish and that there is no better way of dealing with this issue, especially for smaller boats fishing off our coast.  Could some accommodation not be found?  It is being said the landing of cod will not be allowed and that boats will either have to throw it back into the sea or pay a penalty for bringing it ashore.  No one will land cod if a penalty awaits them onshore.  Surely a scheme could be organised, whereby a fisherman would not receive the full value for cod and it would go to a depot where local people could buy it at a reduced rate.  This would be better than throwing it back into the sea.  Seemingly, cod do not survive very long out of water.  There is a way around every problem.  Forcing fishermen to discard fish is a simple way to regulate catches.  However, it would make much more sense to devise a scheme in order that fish, of which we are short, would not be wasted.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I thank the Minister for addressing the House on this very important matter for the fishing industry.  I commend him for his efforts to date on its behalf and for his proactive approach, particularly on the issue of discards which has been mentioned but in numerous other areas also.  I echo the comments of Deputy Harrington in wishing him the very best in his work in the European Union on behalf of the industry.  His performance will be crucial in ensuring the future of the industry and for many households around the coast.In view of the effective management plan for the Celtic Sea herring fishery, will the Minister make a decision soon on the management of the fishery in 2012?  Will sustainability be a key element of that decision?  Has there been further progress on the matter discussed in Clonakilty last July of adding value onshore to catches by foreign fleets?  A number of representatives of the French fishing industry visited Clonakilty on that occasion and we had an informative gathering.  Has further progress been made or has contact been made with other countries on the matter?  It represents a great opportunity for coastal communities and has major job creation potential.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I listened with interest to the Minister's comments.  I am sure he will agree with me that any reduction in the opportunities available to the fishing fleet in the north west would be devastating.  We have seen the devastation in ports across County Donegal.  Killybegs Harbour is still operational, but many other ports, including Burtonport, Bunbeg and other smaller ports, are no longer operational to the same extent.  We cannot see a reduction.  What would such a reduction do to the Government's current plans, particularly those announced six months ago next week in Killybegs?  Deputy Pringle and I were in attendance when the Minister announced the creation of 250 jobs by 2014 and 58 jobs in the seafood processing sector.  Six months later, however, not one of these jobs has materialised, as the Minister indicated to me yesterday in response to my parliamentary question.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Deputy does not understand the process.  I will outline it for him.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I understand the process in terms of the 58 jobs that require the completion of capital works if they are to be created.  Is the Minister disappointed that none of the 308 jobs announced six months ago has materialised?  What would be the impact of the Commission's proposals on such jobs, particularly the 250 identified for Killybegs in the jobs initiative?
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I will ask two brief questions.  In terms of inshore fisheries, what scope does the Minister have to allow fishermen to work within the six-mile limit, particularly in the context of cod recovery plan area 6A?  The ban on net fishing therein is having a severe impact on the inshore fleet.I welcome the Minister's comments on the completion of the appropriate agricultural assessment of four bays.  Unfortunately, a further 86 bays remain to be assessed.  It will take an inordinate amount of time.  Will the Minister examine the process used by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of Sruwaddacon Bay in north-west County Mayo, where an appropriate assessment seems to have been carried out rapidly to allow a major construction project — the building of a tunnel to take gas ashore — to go ahead?  Perhaps this model could be used regardless of a Department's gold plate.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The Minister has been asked to do the impossible, namely, to answer all of these questions in five minutes.  If he would just scratch the surface of them, it would be great.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I will try to answer.  If I do not reach people's questions, I will try to answer them by e-mail or so on.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	248	We understand.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Deputy Harrington asked about next year's tuna quota.  It has been decided and we have managed to secure a roll-over of this year's quota into next year.  This will be deemed a success, given the amount of pressure applied by some countries to take greater shares of the quota to satisfy other interests.  They have not been given those shares.Deputy Clare Daly referred to the matter of electronic log books.  The Commission has insisted that fleets across the EU should implement a system of electronic log books, which would give the enforcement structures of countries like Ireland instant data on what is being caught, where it is being caught and who is catching it.  This means we would not need to rely on a paper trail, which has proven to be an ineffective way of matching catch with boats' quotas.  The electronic log book concept has been welcomed by the Irish industry and will help us to create a more level playing pitch in respect of catches in waters for which Ireland has responsibility.Deputy Wallace's point about discards was correct.  I feel strongly about the issue, as does the industry.  Voluntary initiatives in the industry are being taken to try to ensure fewer juveniles are caught, for example, through the use of better targeted fishing gear on the Celtic Sea.  When one tries to catch cod, one also catches whiting and haddock, which are in the same fishery.  We are considering ways to allow fishermen to be more targeted through the use of, for example, escape hatches and alternative mesh sizes, and to try to release juvenile fish when and where appropriate.The main objective in combating discards must be to avoid the catching of out of quota or unwanted fish as opposed to landing everything caught.  This is particularly so in the case of juvenile fish.  Killing them makes no sense as they are not marketable, people do not want them and it damages future stocks.  The following year, they will be mature and we can catch them.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Mature fish should be caught.  We can deal with the question of catching baby fish by changing equipment.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	251	By changing equipment one can also be more targeted in terms of species, but there will always be an element of by-catch and we need to try to deal with it in a pragmatic way.  We should not incentivise wrong catches.  Once landed, however, we must put a mechanism in place to deal with the issue.To respond to Deputy Doherty, I was in Killybegs at the start of the summer to launch an initiative.  Local stakeholders wanted to put together a jobs document that could create up to 250 jobs during the coming years.  I will launch the document in the next few days, but no one promised 250 jobs or even a portion of that number within six months.  The Deputy should not try to twist something that is positive for his area.  In co-operation with my Department, the local authority, fishing interests and other interests in Killybegs, stakeholders in his area have done a considerable amount of voluntary work in drafting a report so that a sustainable development plan for the region, driven by fisheries, can be put in place to create jobs in the next two to three years.  We are about to launch the finalised report that I announced at the start of the summer.  It is a positive news story and it would be helpful if people did not misrepresent what we are trying to do.

I asked the Minister whether he was disappointed that no jobs had been created within six months.  He is obviously stating that he is not.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The report has not even been published.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Unlike many ports, Killybegs relies mainly on the pelagic sector, but we are not discussing that sector today.  Rather, we are discussing whitefish quotas.  Any reduction in quota will impact on the north west, as it will on any other part of the country.  The primary focus of the study under discussion is on the allocation of whitefish quota, but the pelagic sector is an important one.Deputy Pringle asked about inshore fishing.  We are seeking changes to allow certain fishing to take place, for example, jigging for pollock and gill netting for spotted dog which is used for bait in the crab fishery.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Marine Institute have done trials to add to our arguments and I can send the Deputy further details on the matter.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	261	Briefly.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	262	There are a number of vulnerable areas.  When I saw the initial Commission proposal, I was concerned about its impact on the overall fishery.  Where appropriate, we have worked hard to change the Commission's proposal by putting together data that are based on science and collected in a credible way.Regarding area 6A off County Donegal, we accept that there remains a significant problem in terms of cod.  Where Celtic Sea stocks of herring are concerned, we are encouraging the Commission to be more cautious.  The question of Irish Sea cod is receiving a great deal of political attention from myself and my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MLA, to try for a united approach, North and South.  In terms of making appropriate assessments for new quotas next year, the Commission has got the boarfish issue all wrong.  Thanks to the Marine Institute, we have sufficient credible data to put a new, strong argument in December to improve what is a difficult situation for the industry.  I am determined in this regard.  If people want to contribute to the process, we will happily try to take their points on board.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Minister and Deputies for their statements, questions and answers.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Bill is being brought to the House as a matter of urgency to deal with a number of issues arising from the coming into force of EU regulations on road transport operators on 4 December.  I thank the House for facilitating me in this regard.  To a large degree, the issues arise from the mechanics of the regulations replacing a previous EU directive.In changing the basis for national implementation, some matters previously provided for under national regulations now have to be provided for in primary legislation.  I have also taken the opportunity in the Bill to put forward a small number of new provisions and to make minor amendments to provisions such as false declarations and conditions on licences.I will give the House an outline of the road transport sector and the context for the EU and national legislation.  We are talking about the commercial road transport sector, the sector that provides road haulage and road passenger transport for hire and reward.  This encompasses a considerable amount of the freight traffic within the State and the greater part of public road transport, including Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus services.  All operators for hire and reward require a licence from my Department and the licensing of operators is an EU requirement, currently under Directive 96/26 and shortly under EU Regulations 1071,  1072 and 1073 of 2009.  This reflects the trans-European nature of the business of many operators and the interests of all member states in the sector's reliability and safety.There are approximately 7,000 licensed operators in Ireland using about 25,000 large vehicles.  The sector is important to our economy in the movement of goods and people and as a significant employer.  High standards in the sector — and the good reputation that goes with them — are important for its competitiveness at home and across Europe.  It is important that the public has the assurance that the operators are licensed, safe, reliable and amenable to the law.  It is equally important that legitimate operators are not undermined by those operating either without licences or without complying with the licence standards, including safety on the roads.A strong and competitive road transport sector is important for our economy and road transport legislation must support that by setting standards, influencing positive and responsible behaviour and eliminating financial gain from non-compliance by setting effective deterrents.  Road transport is regulated by various Road Transport Acts since 1933, augmented by EU legislation and national regulations.  That diversity and the 70 year timespan creates an imperative to consolidate legislation and developments in the sector, in the nature of business, and in the EU dimension also drives the need for regular review from time to time.  I am currently looking at all legislation with a view to bringing forward an updated and comprehensive road transport Bill next year, to replace the existing Acts and to set the direction for road transport policy for the coming years.This Bill is a small step in that direction.  While Deputies and Senators may have a number of more general proposals to make about the sector, I may not be able to take them into account in this Bill but I will consider them for the next Bill.The Road Transport Bill 2011 will introduce three improvements immediately.  First, it will strengthen the existing provisions regarding the fitness and suitability of operators to engage in the profession.  Second, it will provide greater accessibility of information so that the general public can find out who is, or is not, licensed.  Third, it will provide for much greater penalties for unlicensed operators and provide for new offences aimed at improving compliance by existing operators.  The imperative for this Bill at this time is to ensure that certain existing provisions remain in force after 4 December.There are four such key provisions.  First, road passenger transport operations must be licensed, and operation without a licence will be an offence; second, fees can be charged for passenger transport licences; third, the appeal provisions where an application for a road passenger transport licence is refused or where such a licence is withdrawn will continue to apply; and exemptions from the requirement to have a road transport operator licence will continue to apply.  These include the carriage of mail and funeral transport.The reason these provisions will otherwise cease to have effect is somewhat convoluted but I can summarise it for the House in general terms.  While the licensing of road haulage provisions is set out in primary legislation, certain passenger transport licensing provisions are provided in national regulations made under the European Communities Act, following EU Directive 96/26.  As the new EU regulations will replace that directive with effect from 4 December, any national regulations relating to the directive cease to have effect on that date.  The specific terminology of the new EU regulations and the fact that those regulations have direct application, mean that some existing national provisions cannot be restated under new national regulations but require primary legislation.  I will go into more detail on the provisions when outlining the individual sections of the Bill.I have mentioned three additional provisions which the Bill will introduce.  The fitness and suitability of operators is one of the key criteria for obtaining and holding a licence, given the nature of the road transport business in transporting goods or passengers, travelling between states and across national boundaries, and high use of the road network.  This comes under the heading of good repute and it is evident that not every applicant will satisfy this requirement.  For example, certain convictions or penalties relating to road safety, vehicle defects, excessive driver hours or smuggling must raise questions about good repute in a road transport business and potentially give grounds for refusing an application or withdrawing a licence.  This is already part of national policy and legislation.Any convictions relating to a range of serious and violent offences such as murder, human trafficking and drug trafficking also have a very direct bearing on good repute.  The Bill provides for this in primary rather than secondary legislation, it extends the range of positions within an operation to which it applies and it allows me to take any of the offences into account whenever they occurred.  In doing this, my objective is to strengthen the good repute provisions and my powers to refuse applications or withdraw licences where this is necessary.Existing national regulations relating to serious convictions are affected by the EU regulations.  They will cease to have effect on 4 December and, even in a restatement, could not now provide for automatic disqualification for five years from the date of conviction as previously.  The EU regulations permit applications to be made and require member states to engage in an administrative process whenever they are considering refusing or withdrawing a licence.  In other words, a person cannot be prohibited from applying for a licence.  The good repute consideration can be a rigorous process and an application can be refused.  An appeal process to the District Court is already provided for in the Road Transport Acts regarding refusal or withdrawal of haulage licences and this has been restated in this Bill to update its provisions and to apply it to passenger licences.The existing regulations related only to serious convictions of the operator but the Bill extends this to include other positions in the business such as directors, business partners and transport managers and crucially to drivers with passenger firms.  This is particularly important since drivers can have access to children, the elderly and other vulnerable people in the course of their job and any convictions for serious or violent offences, such as murder or serious sexual offences, should quite rightly be taken into consideration in the licensing process.The availability of information on who is or is not licensed is important for the public, as the users of the haulage and passenger transport services.  A register of operator licences is already kept by my Department and is available for public inspection but its accessibility can be improved.  In this day and age, such information should be available online, and the proposed amendment in the Bill does that.  Online information will help identify to the public if particular operators, large or small, are currently licensed and if the vehicles they are using are authorised on the licence.  Licensed operators have to meet certain financial and competence requirements, their vehicles must be compliant with all safety requirements and licensed operators are subject to checks and inspections.  Unlicensed illegal operators are potentially less safe and less reliable, with consequent risks for any goods or passengers carried.The Bill will also make it an offence for anyone to claim that they are a licensed operator when they are not.  This should deter any operator from putting the words such as licensed haulier on a truck, when they have no haulage licence.  Having the register in place will make it easier for enforcement authorities to confirm this and to enforce the licensing rules in general at checkpoints on the roadside.Realistic penalties have to be in place to deter illegal activities and operators and the Bill significantly increases the penalties for operating without a licence and introduces some new offences.  Currently, for example, the maximum penalty for operating without a haulage licence is €6,350, and there is no provision for a prison term.  That penalty was set 25 years ago and is hardly a deterrent anymore.  This Bill will provide that the maximum fine for operating without a licence is €500,000 or a prison term of three years, or both.  We must show the illegal operators out there that we are serious in tackling illegal and unsafe operators.The Bill will also provide the same maximum penalty for consignors who engage illegal operators.  For every unlicensed operator flouting the law, there is an unscrupulous consignor willing to save a few euro by employing an unlicensed operator, thus putting unfair pressure on compliant and legally licensed operators and putting questionable vehicles on the road.  The message I want to give out is that unlicensed operators are far more likely to be unsafe, less reliable and to be poor employers.  Anyone giving them business is complicit in encouraging them and will be liable to the same stiff penalties.This Bill will also introduce some new offences.  Operating a vehicle which is not authorised on a licence, even if the operator is licensed, will be an offence with a maximum penalty of €500,000.  It is important that the vehicles used are known and authorised, not just in regard to vehicle safety but also in regard to motor tax and insurance.  This provision should discourage applications for licences with token vehicles.Another new offence relates to making false declarations in order to obtain a licence, or forging or altering licences.  This latter type of activity is on the increase and needs to be made an offence with appropriate penalties.These and other provisions in this Bill will help my Department, the gardaí and the RSA to improve compliance in the sector.  This should help the great majority of hauliers and passenger operators who are responsible and law abiding and willing to compete fairly on a level playing field.  As I said earlier, I do not pretend to address all road transport issues or concerns in this Bill, given its particular time imperative.  It is, however, my intention to take a wider and more long-term perspective on the sector in a road transport Bill next year.Section 1 of the Bill contains definitions; these are standard provisions.Section 2 outlines the obligation on operators to inform the Minister of certain convictions.  This is the main section relating to certain serious convictions.  It requires an applicant or a licensed operator to inform the Minister of certain serious convictions which apply to the operator, certain positions within the operation, such as director, business partner, transport manager, and drivers with passenger transport operations.The serious convictions are, whether in Ireland or in another jurisdiction, murder; manslaughter; drug trafficking; certain non-fatal offences against the person; human trafficking; certain sexual offences; certain money laundering, theft and fraud offences; firearms offences; and aiding and abetting the said offences.  The Minister is to be notified of certain details of the convictions, including the nature of the offence, the penalty or sentence, and whether the offence was committed in the course of or connected with a road transport business.  Failure to inform the Minister or providing false information will be an offence and also grounds for refusing an application or suspending or withdrawing a licence.Section 3 relates to the obligation to inform operators of certain convictions.  This section requires those holding certain positions within the operation to inform the operator of any of the specified convictions which apply to them and makes it an offence to fail to do so.Under section 4 the Minister is to consider certain convictions.  This section provides that the convictions set out in section 2 are to be considered by the Minister in relation to the good repute of an applicant or operator.  This is one of the four criteria for a road transport operator licence, the others being financial standing, professional competence of the transport manager and establishment in the State.  The section restates the Minister's powers to decide, if good repute is not satisfied, that the application can be refused or the licence suspended or withdrawn.Section 5 enables the current provisions relating to appeals to the District Court against refusal of an application or withdrawal or suspension of a passenger transport operator's licence to be maintained, once the current national regulations cease to have effect.  It takes the opportunity to combine the appeal provisions for road haulage and passenger transport operator licences.Section 6 sets out the nature of evidence of foreign convictions required in proceedings for an offence in section 2, which relates to failure to inform the Minister of the specified convictions.Section 7 relates to continued compliance.  For the avoidance of doubt, this section restates and clarifies existing provisions so the Minister may request and must be provided with any necessary information from an applicant or a licence holder, to be satisfied that the person meets or continues to meet the requirements for obtaining a licence.  It also provides that the licence is the property of the Minister and must be returned on request where it is suspended or withdrawn.Section 8 is a new provision which requires an applicant or licensed operator to notify the Minister of any changes in details or circumstances which would cause him or her no longer to meet the requirements for a licence.  This would be relevant, for example, if an operator's circumstances changed and he or she no longer met the financial standing criteria, or if the operator no longer had a suitable transport manager.Section 9 replaces existing provisions for passenger transport which now require primary legislation and it combines them with similar road haulage provisions which are already in primary legislation.  It provides that a person may not carry on the business of a road transport operator without a licence; a licensed operator may not operate a vehicle that is not specified in the licence; a person may not engage the services of a road transport operator for hire and reward unless the services are exempted or the operator is licensed; and the types of carriage listed in the Schedule, such as carriage of mail, carriage of refuse, funeral transport, are exempted from the requirement to have a licence.Section 10 is the prohibition on purporting to operate other than in accordance with an operator's licence.  This section prohibits a person purporting to operate other than in accordance with a licence.  It is a new provision for passenger transport operators but reflects existing provisions in relation to road haulage operators.Section 11 outlines the obligation to carry copy of an operator's licence etc. and display a transport disc on a vehicle.  This section requires operators to ensure that all appropriate documentation is kept in their vehicles, and that a transport disc is properly displayed on vehicles.  It also empowers gardaí and transport officers to inspect such documents when required.  Again, this is a restatement in primary legislation of a passenger transport provision and its combination with existing road haulage provisions.Section 12 restates and adds to the existing provisions in relation to a register under section 10 of the Road Transport Act 1986, which it repeals.  It repeats existing provisions establishing a register of operator licences and certificates of competence for transport managers, requiring the register to be open for inspection, and providing for copies of entries.  It adds a provision that the register may be published on the Internet, i.e. the Department's website, and clarifies that the information provided may include vehicle details.  The facility to publish on-line is currently not possible without primary legislation and will facilitate better public access to information on licensed businesses.Section 13 replaces existing provisions for charging fees for passenger transport licences, as they now require primary legislation.  It combines them with similar provisions for road haulage licences, and takes the opportunity to provide for the payment of fees for a wider range of documents, including duplicate or replacement documents, and fees for training, examinations and certificates of professional competence for transport managers which the Minister has authorised to be carried out on his or her behalf.Section 14 extends the existing provisions relating to false declarations, statements or information in the context of obtaining a licence, certificate etc. to include alterations to documents and forgeries.Section 15 restates the existing standard provision on offences by bodies corporate to cover offences under this Bill.  The section also provides that a summary offence under the Bill may be prosecuted by the Minister or by the Road Safety Authority.Section 16 restates the existing provisions in relation to the powers of transport officers of the Road Safety Authority to include references to this Bill, the EU regulations, and any road transport regulations made under the European Communities Acts.Section 17 restates existing provisions on road transport enforcement powers of RSA transport officers to search premises under warrant.Section 18 relates to transport managers and combines existing provisions for requirements for transport managers of passenger and road haulage operations and combines them in primary legislation.Section 19 amends the 2006 Act to include "established in the State" as a criterion for obtaining a road transport operator's licence, as required under the new EU regulations.  The other criteria are good repute, financial standing and professional competence.  It also takes the opportunity to provide that an application form may be determined by the Minister, rather than prescribed in regulations as is currently the case for passenger transport operations, and to state, for clarity, that any conditions attached to a licence must be complied with, and that the Minister may refuse to grant a licence until the applicant has complied with regulations under section 6 of the 2006 Act.  This relates to details of the application process.Section 20 amends a definition in the Road Transport Act 1999 to include reference to EU regulations.Section 21 is a standard provision for the service of notices and notifications, such as in section 5 on appeals.Sections 22 and 23 relate to expenses, the Short Title and construction.  These are standard provisions.  My intention is that the Bill will come into operation on signature.The Schedule lists types of carriage which are exempted from the requirement to hold a road transport operator licence.That summarises the Road Transport Bill.  Road transport legislation is somewhat convoluted and I hope I have explained the provisions clearly.  As I outlined at the beginning of my speech, the Bill is being brought to the House as a matter of urgency to deal with a number of particular issues that arise from new EU regulations on road transport operators which come into force on 4 December.  A small number of additional provisions have been included to improve some elements of licensing.  I fully recognise that the circumstances of the Bill do not allow a full consideration of the many and varied aspects of road transport, which could potentially provide material for lively debate, new ideas and amending legislation.  However, in taking the approach in this Bill of dealing with the most urgent issues, I see it as the first step in a comprehensive review process, and I have a more detailed road transport Bill in mind for next year.I look forward to the cooperation of the House in facilitating the passage of the Bill and commend it to the House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  It is technical in nature and it is a requirement for it to be enacted by 4 December.  I do not intend to delay the Bill's passage but I am concerned about its late publication.  The Bill is being presented to give effect to EU regulations adopted more than two years ago.  While provision was previously made for the regulations by way of statutory instrument, I find it hard to understand why the Oireachtas is expected to pass this primary legislation on the nod because the deadline is 4 December.  It really is no way to do business.  Rushed legislation, as the Minister is well aware, is never good legislation.  There are times when it is necessary but this is not such a time.  There was adequate time to prepare this legislation considering that it is more than two years since it became known that the regulations would ultimately require primary legislation. That said, Fianna Fáil will certainly facilitate the smooth passage of the Bill but I caution the Minister that Fianna Fáil is not to be taken for granted in this regard.I look forward to the more comprehensive legislation the Minister has promised.   Some of the points raised in my contribution will clearly show the necessity for that legislation to be introduced as a matter of urgency.  It will ensure that there is a fair and competitive environment for all transport operators across the European Union who wish to operate in this jurisdiction.The transport industry, as the Minister is well aware, is a vital component of our domestic economy.  The licensed haulage sector comprises in excess of 18,000 vehicles, providing approximately €1 billion to the State over the course of a year, taking into account duty, road tax and various other taxes raised through the people who work in the sector, including those who pay PAYE tax and PRSI.  There are approximately 50,000 people employed in the sector, including drivers, mechanics, warehouse staff and administrative staff.  There are approximately 4,000 operators in the licensed haulage sector.  This is just a fraction of the overall number in the transport sector.  Obviously, own-account operators are in a different category and, to a large extent, they operate in an unlicensed environment.The licensed haulage sector represents a substantial sector of our country.  It is important that it be regulated appropriately and that standards be maintained to the highest level.  Unscrupulous operators should be dealt with appropriately to the benefit of those who operate in a licensed environment and customers and suppliers generally within the sector.  Customers need to be assured of the bona fides of operators.  Those hauliers who wish to comply and operate reputably ought to be given the protection of the State to ensure there is not an anti-competitive environment.The provisions the Minister announced that amend existing provisions on the good repute of applicants for licences are welcome.  They set the appropriate standard for the applicants and existing licence holders.  Access over the Internet to the national register of licensed operators is useful in that it protects customers and licensed operators.  Increased penalties for unlicensed operators should act as a serious deterrent.  A fine of €500,000 is appropriate.  The old story applies; we often set targets and find that the Judiciary brings its own views to bear on them.  It is obviously a matter for it but I hope that, where somebody has been operating in an unlicensed environment and seeks to breach the provisions and legislation, he will be dealt with appropriately.  I hope the fines imposed by the courts will act as a deterrent.  This would be exceptionally helpful.As the Minister knows, the Bill is to give effect to three EU regulations, Nos. 1,071, 1,072 and 1,073 of 2009.  Regulation No. 1,072 relates to the rules of access for the international road haulage market.  It is becoming more clear to me that there are no provisions in this Bill relating to market access issues in general.  Perhaps the Minister will address this in the legislation he proposes to bring forward next year.  If so, I look forward to his views on it.There is no provision in the Bill to regulate the procedure of cabotage.  Perhaps there is some manner in which the Minister proposes to deal with it.  I understand a very serious issue arises owing to a distortion of fair trade guidelines in so far as they bear on Irish road hauliers.  This is because of the interpretation by the UK Government of Regulation No. 1,072 to the extent that it relates to roll-on, roll-off, or ro-ro, traffic.  What efforts has the Minister made to address this problem?  Has he negotiated a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom in light of our island status and the importance of ro-ro traffic to our export sector?  Has he sought any derogation for Irish hauliers from the Commission in regard to the application of the regulation in so far as it relates to the definition of the first movement allowable under the cabotage clause?  In other words, has he sought to exclude the port of entry as the point of first movement under cabotage rules for ro-ro traffic, thereby treating ro-ro traffic in the same manner as accompanied traffic?While this matter is technical and while it has taken me some time to get my head around the concept of point of first movement, I recognise the competitive disadvantage affecting Irish road hauliers who seek to develop a ro-ro business providing a cheaper offering to our exporters with a view to ensuring that our exporters remain more competitive in this difficult environment.  Therefore, there is a very strong business case for finding a solution.There are no provisions in the Bill to implement the cabotage provisions of Regulation No. 1,072.  I understand that, by not doing so, we are allowing inequitable circumstances to continue to obtain for Irish road hauliers.  UK hauliers, including those from Northern Ireland, who offer their services here are seen to have a free-for-all.  As far as I am aware, there is no capacity for us to enforce the three-movement rule as set out in the cabotage clause in Regulation No. 1,072  in terms of external road hauliers in a way that would ensure a free and equitable competitive environment for all.  We must not allow this to continue.  If cabotage is a concept that the Minister intends to deal with in legislation next year, I urge him to bring it forward as quickly as possible.I understand from talking to various actors within the industry that the problem is having an impact on their capacity to compete.  It has been suggested to me that, for Irish road hauliers to level the playing pitch, they will have to register trucks in the United Kingdom.  Obviously, this would result in considerable losses to the Irish State.  The idea behind the cabotage rules was to negate this requirement.  We need to move on this, bearing in mind that Irish road hauliers are subject to very stringent rules in the United Kingdom because of the UK interpretation.  Much of this relates to the ro-ro aspect.  The difficulty is that hauliers from Northern Ireland in particular seem to have unhindered access to the market on this side of the Border, yet they are treated as domestic hauliers on the other side of the Irish Sea.  We are in a unique position because of the land and sea borders.  Our exportation of goods in such large volumes to the United Kingdom puts our hauliers at a disadvantage.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.Owing to the Minister's role in tourism and transport, he is well aware that Ireland, as an island nation, is a major exporter.  Exportation is really the only positive aspect of our economic activity in the current climate.  Our export sector depends primarily on the road haulage sector to access the EU markets.  It is vital, therefore, that we create a competitive environment for our road hauliers and give them the appropriate protection that other jurisdictions seem to provide for theirs.  It is necessary not only because we need reduced rates to ensure we can get our product to market as cheaply as possible and compete with other primary producers on the Continent but because it will allow our indigenous transport sector to grow.  As I pointed out, this sector is a significant component of our economy.  If the cabotage issue is not dealt with, it will make it easier for foreign hauliers, particularly those from Britain and Northern Ireland, to compete more aggressively in Ireland, to the detriment of our haulage sector.The Minister is aware of the price elasticity hazard that exists and which will, in terms of the transport of our goods, have a very negative impact on exports and, consequently, our economic output.  We must not allow any practice that undermines our economic output at this time.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	267	To set the question of statutory sick pay in context, the total expenditure by my Department in 2010 on payments in respect of illness and disability to almost 250,000 beneficiaries amounted to more than €2.8 billion.  In 2001 the number of beneficiaries was less than 174,000 and expenditure was some €1.1 billion.  A table setting out these figures in detail follows.The total amount in illness benefit paid in each of the years specified by the Deputy is: 2006, €627.6 million; 2007, €755.1 million; 2008, €852.3 million; 2009, €919.8 million; and 2010, €942.8 million.  Expenditure on illness benefit in that five year period amounted to more than €4 billion, while annual expenditure on the scheme has almost trebled in the past ten years.  Expenditure in the current year will be at broadly the same level as 2010, when some 330,000 illness benefit claims were awarded.Introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay is one of a range of options being examined with a view to reforming the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries, addressing the deficit in the social insurance fund and meeting the commitments which the previous Government entered into with the European Union, the IMF and the ECB to achieve substantial reductions in current spending.Depending on how it is structured, a statutory sick pay scheme has the potential to achieve considerable savings.  I am conscious of the pressures many employers face, particularly in the SME sector, and any statutory sick pay scheme will seek to take account of these concerns to the greatest extent possible.  Some of the employers' concerns were outlined to me during a meeting I held with IBEC last week.  However, such a scheme is the norm among most EU member states.  The extent to which employers are liable varies significantly, with a figure of two years in the Netherlands, 28 weeks in Britain and north of the Border and nine days in Finland.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe specific manner in which such schemes operate varies considerably in terms of coverage, payment rates and compensation for certain employers.  It is also the case that statutory sick pay will tend to stimulate and incentivise employers, both in the private and public sectors, to take a more active role in managing absenteeism.  In the Netherlands, for example, rates of absenteeism fell from 10% to 4% following the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.The House will be aware also that the rate of social insurance paid by employers is low in Ireland when compared to most other EU member states, with the result that the social insurance fund is now in deficit.  In order to address that deficit, the choices we face are to increase social insurance rates, including for employers, reduce benefit rates and coverage or adjust the payment model in a manner which would require employers to share the costs associated with short-term sickness but which would also give them a greatly enhanced role in the management of that cost.YearIllness BenefitDisability AllowanceInvalidity PensionOccupational Injury BenefitBlind PensionTotalRecipientsCost (€m)RecipientsCost (€m)RecipientsCost (€m)RecipientsCost (€m)RecipientsCost (€m)RecipientsCost (€m)200150,715329,89757,655332,30850,615354,45912,54070,4962,12513,156173,6501,100,316200254,590385,29762,783407,58552,147403,61712,84477,0182,09514,221184,4591,287,738200357,464433,45567,720463,60853,414440,26313,01478,7572,06114,816193,6731,430,899200458,726479,61172,976544,48955,864487,37513,39382,6572,02715,868202,9861,610,000200561,845540,24579,253630,72858,352548,28513,73888,0571,98516,661215,1731,823,976200665,774627,64283,697738,43151,954602,41413,90895,9881,47616,964216,8092,081,439200770,404755,07789,048901,13153,956618,13314,214104,3491,47415,031229,0962,393,721200873,609852,30595,7541,052,66053,725685,71714,563112,0141,47216,319239,1232,719,015200977,665919,78399,5761,142,76952,922681,64214,564112,3361,467162,77246,1942,872,807201081,253942,836101,1111,109,54950,766640,00714,930104,8841,48516,033249,5452,813,309
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I do not know if the Minister has met representatives of ISME in addition to those of IBEC.  ISME has stated the proposed change could be the death blow for the retail sector.  Businesses will be facing an increase of 2% in VAT on top of commercial rates at a time when their turnover and retail spending have reduced.  This will be a further imposition on employers and appears to be anti-jobs.  Will the Minister elaborate on any discussions she might have had with IBEC and ISME and their response to the proposal?  It will, in effect, amount to a sick leave tax on businesses in direct contrast with the Government's rhetoric on job creation.  How do IBEC and ISME understand the effects of the proposal?  Has a cost-impact analysis been undertaken to assess the effect on employers?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	All our competitors, including those countries which have good social protection systems, have followed the advice of the OECD to develop schemes of statutory sick pay, under which the cost for the first few days is taken care of by the employee before the employer and, after a period of time, the state steps in.  North of the Border and in Britain the period is 28 weeks.  We are proposing that in this country employers take responsibility for a period of four weeks.In regard to how businesses operate in other jurisdictions, our competitors are acting in line with the recommendations of the OECD which recommended these reforms because illness days claimed constitute a significant cost to businesses and social insurance systems.  This year we have spent €940 million on illness benefit and a further €1.8 billion on disability and invalidity allowances.  We have one of the lowest contribution rates of employee and employer social insurance in the OECD.We have had a broad outline discussion with IBEC.  Introducing a scheme of this nature would require detailed legislation and further consultation with trade unions and employers.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Has the Minister met representatives of ISME and other representative associations of small businesses and retailers?  Many employers in that sector have been pushed into unemployment in recent years and do not have the cushion others have in terms of access to the social protection system.  I acknowledge that in the budget cost neutral measures may be introduced in this regard.  It is only right and proper that a safety net be provided, given that the sector has been forgotten in the past 12 to 18 months.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I regret that the opportunity was not taken during the Celtic tiger years to build a structure of contributions by employees and employers to offer the social protections to which most of us aspire.  It is unfortunate these reforms were not made when the money was available.  Fianna Fáil in government signed the EU-IMF deal this time last year.  The troika has been investigating the areas in which our structures differ from those in other countries.  Several countries have social protection systems that we would envy to share the burden because the important aspect is managing absences in a way that makes provision for those who are ill, while reducing the taking of illness leave unnecessarily.  This can apply in the public as well as the private sector.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	272	JobBridge, the national internship scheme came into operation on 1 July 2011.  As of Friday, 18 November a total of 2,712 individuals had commenced an internship and there were a further 2,591 internships available to be filled.  JobBridge is a Government scheme, which is being administered by the Department of Social Protection in line with normal accounting procedures.  I have appointed a steering group chaired by Mr. Martin Murphy, managing director of Hewlett Packard Ireland.  The steering group, which has my full confidence, contains representatives from Glen Dimplex, the National Youth Council of Ireland, my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and FÁS.The steering group has played a leading role in the promotion of JobBridge to the business community and has been a key factor in securing its very welcome support and participation in the scheme.  Companies participating in the scheme, including HP, are providing interns with opportunities to secure invaluable work experience that will enhance their employability.  Hewlett Packard's participation in JobBridge is a sign of its commitment to and belief in the value of the scheme and the vital support it will offer thousands of jobseekers.All organisations participating in the JobBridge scheme are required to abide by the criteria of the scheme, including the specific measures which have been designed to prevent the abuse of the scheme by employers, protect the intern from exploitation and ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme.  The scheme provides valuable talent to employers based on the enthusiasm, energy and application of the intern.  The conditions include the following: that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised; that the internship is not displacing an employee; and that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.In addition, all host organisations must comply with the monitoring requirements of the scheme, including completion of the monthly compliance reports and the standard internship agreement with their interns.  This agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of his or her internship.

I urged her to acknowledge that the scheme disincentivises job creation and facilitates the equivalent of slave labour.  She dismissed it at the time but I am again asking questions about the scheme.  Is the Minister satisfied that the steering committee is chaired by the managing director of Hewlett Packard, whom she mentioned earlier?  She mentioned that Hewlett Packard is participating in the scheme and has at least eight free workers courtesy of the scheme.  Does the Minister not accept this represents a clear conflict of interest between the person chairing the steering committee and the objective of the scheme?  Does she not accept that the company of the man charged by her with impartially monitoring JobBridge is actively benefiting from such a scheme?The Minister's party is often regarded as the political sister of the trade union movement.  The law in this State specifically obliges trade union recognition.  Is she aware that Hewlett Packard is one of the most anti-union companies operating in the country?  Is she aware that Hewlett Packard routinely refuses to recognise trade unions to the extent that in an outsource and transfer situation members of the Irish Bank Officials Association, IBOA, were forced to take industrial action to get recognition from Hewlett Packard?  Does she still stand over that appointment?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The Deputy continually seems to take a negative view of opportunities that have now been made available to 2,700 mostly young people to get a foot on the ladder of employment.  Some weeks ago I launched a scheme whereby through Job Skills engineers who had lost their jobs in the construction industry were getting a new chance at employment and switching over to working in medical devices and related areas of activity.Countries such as Germany, which have managed to keep their unemployment rates much lower than here, have a variety of initiatives that allow people to gain vital work experience.  Only last week the Deputy's colleague in the Seanad, Senator Ó Clochartaigh, lamented that lone parents in his area could not access the scheme and he asked me to open the scheme to a wider group of people.  I understand why the Senator would have wanted it: the feedback from JobBridge is quite positive.  We have been evaluating it on a continual basis and want all the leading Irish companies involved, including the company the Deputy mentioned, because it gives a chance to a person who could not otherwise get a foot into the door of employment.

However, various internship advertisements on the website unashamedly pronounce that two to four years' experience is required to get a position.  How can she square that circle?  They cannot, on the one hand, claim that this is to gain experience and on the other hand prevent people from getting the internship because they do not have two to four years' experience.Does the Minister accept that there is a real problem with the scheme?  Is she aware that in 2010 the US Department of Labor produced six criteria covering internships?  One of those criteria provides that the employer can only get an intern for free if it derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern.  This is designed to ensure that the internship must be a benevolent act by the employer and not exploitation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The scheme that operates north of the Border, where the Deputy's party is a participant in government, and in the UK is far less advantageous to the intern.  The Deputy must realise that to open up the possibility of getting work again people, who are now coming out of training having changed direction because the construction sector in which they had been working hard has collapsed, need to get experience.  The return to employers is that they get the initiative, enthusiasm and energy of the person seeking to gain work experience in the area.  There is a win-win for both parties.The Deputy has employed people and knows employers put in significant effort when taking somebody on, in terms of the training, working with them and identifying what they will do.  Employers make a commitment with the State continuing to pay the person's social welfare plus an additional €50.  It is not for everybody, but for some people it represents potentially extremely valuable experience.  I hope the Deputy will gradually come to appreciate that.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	280	The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.The reference from the guidelines quoted by the Deputy does not mean the habitual residence condition does not apply to returning Irish emigrants.  Rather its purpose is to clarify that, once satisfied, HRC can apply from the date of return.  Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the HRC.  I have no statistical evidence of a significant increase in the numbers disallowed on the grounds of not being habitually resident for claims made by returning Irish emigrants.  My Department will review cases brought to its attention.Under social welfare legislation, decisions on all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers.  Each case received for a determination on the HRC is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the individual circumstances of each case.  Since the introduction of the condition, 144 staff at local offices have been trained on habitual residence decisions and training has been provided to approximately 1,000 former community welfare staff who are now on the staff of my Department.In June this year, new national and international HRC guidelines were produced, taking into account recent developments in case law.  The Department also published a supplement which gives example scenarios of how the condition is applied.  These guidelines have been published on the Department's website and circulated to all relevant staff within the Department.  The updated documents make the guidelines clearer and more user friendly for staff and customers alike.  An applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and-or appeal to the social welfare appeals office.

In my experience of dealing with this issue, the only way claimants end up getting their payments is if they quote the EU guidelines.  It is only when that happens that the deciding officer will say, "You are actually right", but if the claimants do not know that before meeting the officer, they will not get what they are entitled to.  Can these guidelines be made more solid, for example, in legislation?I dealt with the case of an elderly man who no longer felt safe in Manchester, where he was living.  It is debatable whether he was right or wrong but he had not lived in Ireland for 30 years.  He had lived here for 35 years before he emigrated.  He returned and he was told he was not entitled to anything and he was not Irish anymore.  People seem to have to fight like dogs to secure their benefits rather than it being pointed out to them that they are entitled to them.  They have to prove something before anything is done for them.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Deputy's question relates to returning Irish emigrants.  I refer to a number of developments that have taken place.  The HRC distinguishes between people who return to the State for a temporary period and those who return with the intention of settling permanently or at least on a long-term basis.  The Department's guidelines indicate the evidence that enables a deciding officer to distinguish that, for instance, the sale of a residence or termination of employment abroad, the shipping of property and personal effects back to Ireland, no immediate family remaining abroad and the expiry of a foreign residence permit, if one was required in the country in which the claimant resided.The Department met representatives of Safe-Home and Crosscare in May 2010.  The attention of officers in the Department was drawn to the arrangements made by Safe-Home for the repatriation of Irish emigrants.  When I visited London for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations shortly after my appointment, I met the representatives of several organisations assisting Irish emigrants, some of whom were returning to Ireland.  The issue is an information gap between the two sides but a claimant must show clearly that he or she is returning to Ireland.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the individual had lived for a long period in the UK and was returning to Ireland.  Applicants have to show they do not intend to return to the UK.  Deciding officers look for evidence that they no longer maintain a home or rent a property there and they have transferred their interest back to Ireland.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I did not table the question to address the elderly man's case.  The person about whom I tabled it made clear that she was returning to Ireland to go to college having been away for three years.  It was only when she pointed out the fact that EU guidelines were in place that she was told she was entitled to the payment.  There is an anomaly in this regard and perhaps the Minister can discuss this with the Minister for Education and Skills.  There seem to be different rules.  If one is claiming welfare when one returns to Ireland, the HRC applies but if one wants to go to college on return to avail of the fees regime as opposed to being treated as someone from outside the EU, one must prove that one is ordinarily resident in the State.  Why the difference?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Deputy should refer that question to the Department of Education and Skills.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The Minister might do that for me.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I know people affected by that issue as well, particularly the children of Irish people who have worked abroad for years, for example, in Africa and whose children are Irish.  When they return home, their children want to go to college here but the Department of Education and Skills has specific rules because it cannot discriminate in favour of people who are Irish.Crosscare indicated the revised guidelines, which followed from the ongoing discussions between the Department and Safe-Home and Crosscare, were much improved and it welcomed their publication.The other issue is that one of the reasons that appeals succeed is that by the time they are heard, it is clear that the applicants have settled in Ireland.  When they first return, they may not have made their case as clearly as they should, whereas a few months later, it may be clear that they are staying.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Between 2005 and 2010, rent supplement expenditure increased from €369 million to €516 million.  The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 in 2005 to more than 96,100 as at 18 November 2011, a 60% increase. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot discuss measures under consideration for inclusion in budget 2012.  However, in framing the budget proposals, my priority will be to continue to make progress on delivering on the commitments in the programme for Government and to deliver good value for money for the taxpayer.My focus in regard to the rent supplement scheme will be to return the scheme to its original intentions of a short-term income support payment for people who suddenly lose their jobs or who are renting a house or flat with the local authorities taking over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of those in receipt of rent supplement on a long-term basis.Two main initiatives are being pursued by the Department to transfer long-term rent supplement recipients into housing solutions supported by local authorities.  One is the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which was introduced in 2004, and gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.The second is the new housing policy framework statement announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning on 16 June 2011, which sets out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term.  A multi-agency steering group has been established by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to give effect to this initiative and this group is developing proposals and operational protocols for the transfer of responsibility from my Department to housing authorities of persons who have long-term housing requirements.  The transfer of tenants from rent supplement to local authorities will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and returning rent supplement to its original intention of a short-term income support payment.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I appreciate that the Minister will not tell me her intentions in this regard for the budget.  Unfortunately, the response to the first question I asked let it slip that employers' sick pay is a kite that will not be taken down by backbenchers, or has not been taken down yet anyhow.We spoke on this issue previously and I asked six weeks ago whether some consideration or initiation of co-operation might be instigated by the Minister with her counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in order that the stock of housing in NAMA may have a social dividend for the State.  There are 100,000 people on this scheme, which, as the Minister rightly says, was never intended to be a long-term solution but has ended up being one.  It is an issue that has to be addressed in the short term.I appreciate and agree with the Minister's intention to move the whole area of rent supplement back to the local authorities, where it belongs, those authorities being the best guardians of housing.  Will the Minister confirm some progress has been made in regard to NAMA stock with her counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government since we last put that proposal to her?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Discussions have been taking place, particularly involving the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, with NAMA in regard to utilising NAMA properties, where appropriate, for housing solutions and the social dividend to which the Deputy refers.  Obviously, these are very difficult issues.I have spoken with and met the local authority managers in this regard.  There is a series of difficulties with rent supplement.  It is probably one of the biggest barriers to taking up employment.  People who get an offer of a job fear they will lose their rent supplement if they go to work, whereas if somebody is on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or is a direct local authority tenant, they are on differential rent and can predict, broadly, their rent charge if they take a job and, most importantly, they are not disbarred from taking a job.The other issue is that in some cases local authorities cannot find tenants to accept some properties because people may prefer an option of renting in the private sector a newer property that may be available in the locality.  In addition, local authority managers have told me they have a problem with some local authority tenants, whether those on RAS or traditional tenants, who build up arrears of rent.  As the Deputy knows, the Department traditionally pays the rent supplement to the individual, who pays it to the landlord.  The local authorities in some instances suggest a very difficult arrears problem has been established.  As part of the changes in rent supplement, we need better IT developments to perhaps facilitate the household budgeting scheme operated by An Post being used to assist local authorities.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Is the Minister looking at the prospect of payments being made directly to landlords under that scheme?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	291	In an ideal world, the payments ought to be made directly to the landlords, which is the idea of RAS.  In that way, we can ensure the landlord is tax compliant and the local authority, where it is operating the allocation, will be in a position to vet the property and establish its standard.  Most importantly, the tenant is free to take up work, subject to the differential rent scheme.  However, the local authorities have 88 separate differential rent schemes and 88 separate computer systems for deducting rent, so there is an IT difficulty.  There is an interdepartmental working group, set up by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, on which my officials are closely involved to try to develop a system that will enable the requirements of the local authorities to be met.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	292	There are almost 52,000 people in receipt of carer‘s allowance from my Department and approximately 22,000 of those are getting half-rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment, an increase of almost 40% since 2008.  This year, we will spend more than €650 million on carers across several schemes.I am very conscious of the needs of people on social welfare and appreciate that many depend solely on welfare payments.  I will do my utmost to protect the most vulnerable people on welfare, including carer's, in the forthcoming budget.  Carers play a particularly important role in society which the Government acknowledges through a range of supports, including carer's allowance, half-rate carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  The means test for carer's allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  A couple with two children can earn up to €35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.The Government's policy is to support the preference of people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities.  Where people are being cared for at home, the care they receive is usually a balance of support from family and professional help.  My Department provides income supports for family carers while the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive provide professional support and services.Obviously, sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for maintaining an adequate system of social protection, as well as for achieving future economic stability and growth.  For these reasons, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure and prioritise resources in my Department in 2012 and in later years.  Final decisions have not been made in regard to welfare expenditure for next year, including carer's allowance.  These decisions will be made after full consideration by the Government and will be announced on budget day.

Does she agree the payment of €102 per week for full-time care is not a bonus, far from it?  Is she aware the payment is generally subsumed into the household weekly budget to cover the many additional costs to which disability gives rise, for example, when caring for a person with cancer or with limited mobility, there is an extra cost to heating a home to ward off the cold, or if someone is caring for an incontinent person, there are extra costs for linen and so on, as is the case for a person with special dietary requirements?The Minister told us there are some 21,000 families on the half-rate carer's allowance.  Is she aware that if she was to cut that allowance, this would result in weekly income cuts ranging from 15% to 50% for those families, and that among those, the largest grouping affected would be pensioners?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	294	As the Deputy is probably aware, the comprehensive review of expenditure being undertaken by the Government follows the format used in a number of other countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Holland.  These were developed at times when those countries had financial difficulties.  In that context, it is necessary to look at every item of expenditure in regard to the budget.  I very much appreciate the contribution carers make.  Carers who care on a full-time basis for people carry out a service of enormous benefit to the people they love and of enormous benefit to our society.  In Ireland we have had an approach that is slightly different in this respect from that in other countries in that in many areas of social welfare, particularly during the Celtic tiger years, there was an emphasis on increasing direct payments whereas many other countries tended to put equal emphasis on payments of income supports and the provision of services.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the spend this year is more than €650 million while ten years ago it was €100 million.

Does she also agree it would be terrible if that were to happen and that it would also involve a huge cost for the State?  Does she agree that since the beginning of 2009 the carer's allowance and disability allowance have been cut by more than 9% and in September the Minister cut a range of fuel allowances at rates of between 16% and 25% while the cost of fuel increased by up to 25% in that period?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Unfortunately, I cannot divulge to the Deputy any details of the budget announcements which may be made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, on budget day.  All I can say is that, as Minister, I very much value and appreciate the role and work carers do in Irish society.  The model of caring we would all wish to see is one where people are enabled, encouraged, facilitated and supported to stay in their own home for as long as possible.  That is the modern model of caring for people who have an illness.  It is important that we should support the development and continuance of that model.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	299	In recognition of the devastation suffered by many families as a result of the recent floods, the Government decided on 8 November 2011 that it was to provide up to €10 million in income-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes.Officials from the Department of Social Protection have made house to house calls to individuals they have identified as being vulnerable at this difficult time and have been in contact with some 700 individuals who have been affected to some degree by the flooding.  Special clinics were also established to offer help to affected households.  Up to 18 November 2011, 443 individual payments to a value of some €122,000 have been awarded to 310 individuals in the affected areas.The main details of the humanitarian assistance scheme are as follows.  It is to be administered on the ground by staff from the Department of Social Protection.  For the most part, these are staff who were formerly community welfare officers working in the HSE who transferred to the Department of Social Protection on 1 October.  The scheme will provide hardship alleviation assistance, as opposed to full compensation, to householders affected by the flooding.  Damage to a person's home and its basic essential contents, such as carpets, flooring, furniture, household appliances and bedding, will be the main criteria but structural damage may also be considered.  Eligibility will be subject to an income test.  Assistance will not be given for losses which are covered by insurance.  Commercial and business losses will not qualify for humanitarian assistance.  Detailed information on the scheme is available on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie.
The Government has also established a cross-departmental and agency working group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to oversee the State's collective response to those affected by the flooding.  This working group will identify any gaps that may exist within existing services to address the consequences of the flooding for individuals, families and communities.  If additional services are required, the group will report to Government with proposals to address these issues.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAs the Deputy will be aware a similar allocation of €10 million was made available as a result of the 2009 floods.  I expect that my Department will spend in excess of €4 million with a further €16.4 million spent by the local authorities and over €0.5 million by the Department of Agriculture and Food on fodder relief for farmers, making a total spend of over €21 million.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	300	We need to understand the severity of this problem.  In a series of locations in my area, namely, Blackrock, Sallynoggin and Stradbrook, and I suspect this is also the case elsewhere in the city and across the country, people have been repeat victims of flooding.  It keeps happening in the same places and the consequences of it have been devastating.  Flood waters mixed with sewage have washed through people's homes.  The insides of their homes have been utterly ruined and walls have been knocked down in some cases.  Back garden walls have been washed away and have smashed into houses behind them.  People were forced out of their homes and are still out of them because of the damage done and they have to pay for alternative accommodation.The key point is that this was not a natural disaster.  The fact that it has happened repeatedly in the same places points to the fact that it was a man-made disaster arising from the chronic failure to invest in water and drainage infrastructure in those places where it has been known for many years, in some cases decades, that there was a serious problem.There has also been a failure on the part of planners to insist on proper water and drainage infrastructure when development was taking place, which means more water has been displaced and flooding got worse.  All the places that have been flooded indicate that the flooding has got worse.  Therefore, there should be no restrictions on the compensation provided for flood victims because it was not their fault.

I am very grateful to the families who let me into their homes which were badly affected by the flooding and, as the Deputy said, in quite a few cases by repeat flooding in parts of Cabra, Tallaght and Donnycarney.  Certainly families and individuals have suffered grievously from the floods.The Deputy should understand that the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection is to provide the humanitarian assistance, which is immediate assistance, and then also to help with buying and replacing appliances such as fridges, freezers and so on.The Deputy referred to cases where perhaps homes may need to be rebuilt or a family whose house was built on a flood plain may need to be relocated.  Following the floods of 2009, with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be very familiar, Galway was very affected as were areas all along the River Shannon basin.  Numbers of families have been relocated.  It is possible for families to get assistance with accommodation costs if they have to move out of their homes but this must be done on a means-tested basis because of the restricted resources of the Department in regard to accommodation, house replacement or significant rebuilding of structures.  I have asked the Government——

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	307	It should be pointed out to the other Departments that are linked into addressing this issue that there needs to be a co-ordinated strategy to deal with all aspects of it in terms of insurance and dealing with the drainage and water infrastructure.  With regard to the Minister's brief, I have received many reports of there being great inconsistency in what community welfare officers are willing to give people who call to them.  In one place a person will get nothing while in other places the response in terms of humanitarian assistance is quite generous.  Therefore, we need these guidelines.  A number of community welfare officers contacted by my office stated they had no guidelines.  Either they did not know what the guidelines were or there was uncertainty about them.  There is a need for clarity and generosity when it comes to dealing with people who are innocent victims of the failure of various authorities to deal with this problem.

Is it possible for community welfare officers to have a degree of flexibility and discretion when engaging in means tests?  I am aware of a family which was €50 above the threshold, but it had bills and debts which were not taken into account.  If flexibility was allowed, they could have some furniture in the house.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Community welfare officers were employed by the HSE but are now in the Department of Social Protection.  They used to go out and knock on doors in various parts of the city where they were aware of people enduring hardship, particularly older people or those on social welfare.  I am sure Deputy Ó Snodaigh knows this and has seen the devastation caused.  The devastation I saw was absolutely appalling.  The job of community welfare officers is to assist.  I, therefore, advise the Deputy to meet the appropriate social welfare officers in the areas about which he is speaking because the guidelines are available on the Department's website and can be interpreted sympathetically by them.  However, the matter is subject to a means test for reasons the Deputy understands.I asked the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has agreed to establish a special interdepartmental committee to deal with this issue.  Following the floods in Galway and the disastrous floods in Cork, money was spent in providing humanitarian relief.  Significant amounts were spent on relocating people, while flood relief works were undertaken by the OPW.  If it is a recurring problem, there is only one solution.  In Dublin, one month's rainfall fell in a couple of hours.  These 100 year events seem to be happening more frequently now.  It is hoped the interdepartmental committee will produce greater clarity in the actions various agencies take, including in planning.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 23, 34 and 37 together.The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to approximately 1.4 million people every week at a cost of approximately €21 billion per annum.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people receive the entitlements due to them.For 2011, my Department has a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and achieving €540 million in control savings.  At the end of October, approximately €536 million in estimated control savings were reported and more than 746,000 reviews have been carried out.  For 2012, the target for control savings is provisionally set at €625 million, an increase of €85 million on the 2011 target.Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  Control savings are not actual moneys recovered by the Department, but they are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these control activities taking place.  They are, therefore, an estimate of future expenditure avoided.  These savings arise as a result of control activity on claims in payment and from inspections of employers.  These activities also have deterrent or knock-on effects which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  They are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  As control savings are already factored into the budget estimates, the reductions in expenditure that the Department is expected to achieve in the forthcoming budget will come on top of the existing fraud control measures of €625 million.I recently launched a new fraud initiative which aims to put in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and ensure public confidence in the integrity of the system is improved.  A key priority is to ensure fraudulent activity in the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combated.  Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system.  Deputies may be aware of the large increase in the volume of social welfare inspections of employers and inspectors' visits to people in receipt of a social welfare income and inspectors examining information supplied to the Department by members of the public.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I am glad to hear the Minister will achieve the target of €540 million which the Department inherited this year.  I would like her to kill a myth which has evolved in recent weeks.  Last week I heard the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, state that of the €700 million reportedly targeted for savings in the Department, €600 million would be achieved by virtue of anti-fraud measures.  Will the Minister clarify for him and others in the Government who may be portraying this view that, first and foremost, the Department has achieved the target of €540 million it inherited this year and that next year a target has been set for the Department of €625 million, which indicates the savings that can be made by the Department in this area against the target figure of €700 million amount to only €85 million?  When I say "only," I do not mean to be flippant, as it is a great deal of money when we are speaking about people in great need who depend on all payment rates, let alone primary rates.  I do not understand what is meant by "primary" or "secondary" when those dependent on income from the Department of Social Protection value every euro and cent they receive, irrespective of what somebody calls it.  Will the Minister clarify that the net saving in respect of the target of €625 million set for next year will be €85 million and that this is the only figure that can be measured against the Department's target figure of €700 million?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Yes, I do wish that some of the statements made about fraud savings could magic away the requirements of the IMF and the troika with regard to social welfare expenditure.  All of my predecessors in this portfolio would be delighted if this were to happen.An example of what happens in most fraud control activity is finding people in a place of employment not registered for PRSI and who are, therefore, working in the black economy.  Normally the explanation given is that they have just started work and it is almost impossible to prove otherwise.  What happens is that fraud and error detection work prevents future expenditure on a claim which would be deemed inappropriate.  These savings are built into the Department's Estimate.  However, in recent times I have advocated targeting areas in which there is a good reason or information to suspect there might be fraud or abuse in order to have a targeted and coherent examination, involving visits to employers and multi-agency checkpoints with the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners, the customs service and the taxi regulator, to check that persons involved in various activities and employments are properly registered for PRSI, tax and social welfare contributions.  These visits have yielded an interesting number of cases and outcomes involving people who have been claiming benefits to which they have not been entitled, or who have been working in the black economy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	315	May I reiterate some of the points made by Deputy Cowen?  It is misleading because people were under the impression that there was welfare fraud amounting to €600 million.  It was disingenuous for some people to suggest that this was the case.  There is no doubt that there is welfare fraud but by all accounts it is nothing remotely close to the figure we are talking about.  The Minister has probably seen the TASC report by Mr. Michael Taft in which he stated:It suits a certain agenda which wants to soften up public opinion for social welfare cuts to claim that hundreds of millions have been lost to fraud and cheats.  We have had television investigations, newspaper headlines, and attention-seeking politicians all claiming massive fraud.  But out of a budget of nearly €20 billion, the Department of Social [welfare] has found only €25 million in fraudulent payments — or about 0.1% of the entire budget.The figure of €600 million is therefore a bit misleading.  Last year, some serious research was undertaken by an independent group in Britain.  With a population of 60 million there, welfare fraud was estimated at £1.5 billion.  The same research estimated that tax evasion and tax unpaid by tax exiles amounted to £80 billion.  Our Government should examine the same scenario.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	316	What the Deputy is saying is well accepted by people, and certainly by myself.  Whether the fraud concerns social welfare or tax evasion, both mean that honest businesses and taxpayers must pay for entitlements to which others should be contributing.  According to an estimate I have used before, there is approximately a 1% fraud rate in the social welfare system.  We do not know, however, because the information on this is quite sketchy.  Nonetheless, 1% of €20 billion is €200 million.There is also an issue of the integrity of the system.  Since the recession hit, members of the public have been contacting the Department of Social Protection in large numbers on issues that they are unhappy about.  I will cite one example, if time allows.  A non-residency project was carried out as one of the ongoing national projects.  The special investigation unit focused on individuals who were suspected of not being resident in the State.  Nearly 3,000 people had home visits and were interviewed about their claim status.  A total of 308 claims were terminated as a result of the special investigations unit, with savings of €3.24 million to the Department.  Those savings are important but what is also important is the confidence in the integrity of the system, so that contributors know that the money is going to those who are entitled to the relevant entitlements, such as pensioners and those on disability or invalidity benefit.There is also a great deal of confusion about our system because people are allowed to work, and it is perfectly legitimate.  They may be working part-time and sometimes their neighbours may think that is not permitted when, in fact, the system does permit it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I am coming at things from a slightly different angle on the same point.  If the intention in focusing on fraud is really about reducing the social welfare bill, would it not also be quite important to focus on ridiculous anomalies such as, for example, the case of a young man named Fergus O'Farrell, who is mentioned in a question further down the list?  He wants to go on the back to education allowance but is deemed ineligible because he is too young and so is being forced to drop out of college and go back on the dole.  Consequently, he will spend nine months longer on the dole, whereas he wants to go to college but cannot get the allowance to do so.  Should we not examine such anomalies involving people who want to get back into education so they can be trained and upskilled rather than being dependent on social welfare?  The current system is forcing them back onto dependency on social welfare.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Social welfare entitlements are set out in law, upon which the inspectors must make their decisions.  The individual to whom the Deputy referred obviously has a particular difficulty.  Confidence in the social welfare system is a separate issue to that of fraud.  I have had numerous representations concerning difficulties in the taxi industry.  That industry used to provide reliable employment for one person or a family.  We now have large volumes of people working in the taxi sector where a review is currently going on.  The key thing is to ensure that taxi drivers' PRSI numbers are recorded.  In addition, when they are working in the taxi industry they must be recorded for tax and PRSI purposes.  At the moment, special investigation units are carrying out inquiries throughout the country to ensure that people who are offering taxi services are properly registered for tax and PRSI.  It is vital that every other citizen who is paying tax and PRSI has confidence that others are not abusing the system.

He was referring to the sum of €25 million in fraud but that equates to only 0.1% of the total budget.  Overpayments from bureaucratic administration or applicants' errors account for €83 million.  Does the Minister agree that that combined figure is a lot less than the €600 million she has been quoting?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The biggest problem society faces in this area is the rampant growth of the black economy, which is a big threat to legitimate businesses that are paying tax and have their employees properly recorded.  It is important to inform the public about the work that is being done in this regard by my Department's special investigations unit, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.  It would be a disaster for the economy if we were paying social welfare to those who are also working in the black economy.  They are undermining legitimate businesses and are costing the State money.  I accept that there are a lot of errors and misclaims arising from honest mistakes but, nonetheless, it is important to combat social welfare fraud.  The last social welfare Bill included extra powers to provide for integrated checkpoints, which have been producing a great deal of additional information, as well as ensuring employers and employees are properly registered.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty.  Expenditure on child benefit for 2011 is estimated at €2.08 billion in respect of some 1.133 million children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment.In November of last year, the Department published a policy and a value for money review of child income support policies and associated programmes.  The review examined the effectiveness and efficiency of child income support payments in meeting policy objectives over the period 1997-2010, including the provision of targeted assistance to families at risk of poverty.  The review indicated that child poverty fell, particularly at times when the level of universal support was increased, and that child income support payments, including child benefit, contributed to this reduction.  However, the report indicated that better outcomes could be attained through rationalising the current system of child income support payments and selective programmes in particular, in order to provide more consistent assistance to low income families and to encourage parental employment.The ESRI has also separately assessed the progress on the reduction of child poverty over the period 2004-07 and found that young children under the age of five, children in large households and children in lone parent households experienced substantial declines in their risk of poverty.  It is suggested that this pattern of the decline in poverty can be attributed in part to developments in child income support policy, including the increase in child benefit rates over the period.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe value for money review noted that the provision of effective and efficient supports to families with children is only one part of an adequate and comprehensive strategy for addressing child poverty.  Tackling child poverty is a priority for the Government and a key goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, NAPinclusion.  Factors contributing to childhood poverty include living in lone parent households, labour market inactivity of parents, low parental educational attainment and living in households dependent on income supports.The broader issue of family and child income supports is currently being examined by the advisory group on tax and social welfare, which I established in June of this year.  The group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.

Does the Minister still agree that child benefit is the sole universal benefit, should be protected as such and should not be reduced?  Does she agree that the fairest and simplest method is to give child benefit for every child at the same rate and use the tax system to recoup from wealthy parents?  For example, we propose to introduce a third rate of income tax on individuals or a wealth tax.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I have previously advised Deputies that I established an advisory group or commission on tax and social welfare in June this year.  The first issue the group has been tasked with is to recommend cost-effective solutions to employment disincentives and achieve better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  As I indicated to the Deputy there has been a number of reports, with one from the Department and one from the ESRI, examining how to retain the core value of universal child benefit.  If I may make a gender-based remark, those who want to abolish universal child benefit are generally men, and women are not usually consulted.  The payment is generally made to women, who appreciate it.  The group will report by the end of next March and I hope we will find a way to retain universality of payment while finding methods of consolidating the other payments relating to children, such as the child dependant allowances and family income support.  They must become more coherent.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	324	There have been recent reports on the issue and comments by various members of the Minister's party.  There is also a reference in the programme for Government and comments were made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, on the occasion of 100 days in office and when Deputy Nulty entered the House after a successful by-election in the Minister's constituency.  In light of these, will the Minister confirm that the Labour Party insisted on Fine Gael dropping its demands to reduce the benefit before entering into negotiations for the programme for Government?

The figure for children in poverty will increase from approximately 90,000 to 130,000.  Research from the European Anti-Poverty Network in Ireland indicates that far from being overly generous, the spend on social welfare here is the third lowest in a group of 15 European countries.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Did the Labour Party give commitments prior to the election about not touching child benefit because it knew it would be wrong to attack the benefit?  Does the Minister agree that the only consequence of cutting child benefit would be to increase child poverty and hit the most vulnerable sectors of society?  Is it a red herring to speak about a few wealthy people benefitting from the payment when the majority of recipients are working, poor and vulnerable people who need it?  If the Minister is to deal with wealth inequalities in our society, she could do so by imposing higher income taxes on the wealthy rather than cutting child benefit.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I stated already that I recognise the value of the universal payment, which is one of the few universal payments in the Irish welfare system.  It is particularly valued by those parents providing the care, which is usually the mother, although there are increasing numbers of fathers parenting on a full-time basis.  In reforming child benefit we must achieve a targeted system that will utilise a universal payment while regarding other payments, such as child dependant allowances and family income supplement.  We must achieve the best of both systems but, importantly, provide a very clear path for parents to be able to be in employment while continuing to receive a level of support.I acknowledge that some people have indicated they do not require child benefit.  They can certainly volunteer to surrender it to the State.  People who have held office have done this and I did so during the course of the last Dáil.  It is possible to surrender unwanted State payments and salaries to the Minister for Finance.  It should be possible for people to surrender the payments if they so wish.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I am thankful for the opportunity to raise this matter, which concerns the quality of rental accommodation within the city of Dublin and beyond, and the abuse of property by landlords who allow large numbers of people to be resident within some of these properties.  At the turn of the century much of the literature from this city referred to tenements, the conditions within which some people were living and the poverty and exploitation that took place.  As we look at the city today I am convinced that we are seeing the return of tenements to many parts of the city as tenants are living in conditions that are beyond sub-standard.  These people are being exploited and are asked to live in conditions not fit for human habitation.  Alongside this are neighbouring residents who must deal with the impact of such properties on areas, and in extreme cases the criminal behaviour emanating from some properties.Although many landlords take their responsibility seriously, a small number do not and behave in a rogue fashion.  These people have an extremely negative effect on the environment, tenants and other residents.  This issue is particularly obvious in my constituency in Dublin Central and the city's council is currently addressing it, with my colleague, Councillor Ray McAdam, leading the work in the area.  I spent an hour yesterday walking with residents along the North Circular Road and saw fabulous houses with walls falling down, windows falling out and a large number of tenants living inside.  Many of the tenants living in those properties, and their landlords, are also in receipt of either rent allowance or rental schemes overseen by Dublin City Council.The reason I raise the matter as a topical issue is that it is absolutely crucial that strong action be taken now to ensure that tenants living in such properties are better protected and that action would be taken against the landlords who are providing the accommodation to ensure the property is brought up to standard.  Tenants and residents are suffering from the large amount of rental property that is moving towards a derelict state within the city and beyond.  Given that the State is currently spending nearly €500 million in rent allowance it offers a tool to the Government and State agencies to ensure rental standards are implemented and that landlords do not take advantage of anyone.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005 rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to €516 million in 2010.  The number of people on rent supplement has increased from almost 60,200 people in 2005 to more than 96,100 as at 18 November 2011, a 60% increase.Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.  However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  In consultation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of non-compliance with standards.Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant the Department would normally discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  This condition is aimed at improving the standards of accommodation which rent supplement tenants occupy and supports the local authority in meeting its responsibilities on housing standards.The Department must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  Where the Department's representatives become aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to them to be sub-standard, they notify the respective local authority and it may advise prospective tenants that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.  In addition, my Department shares information with a range of other Departments and bodies with a view to improving the regulation of the private rented market.My Department provides details of long-term rent supplement tenancies to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on a quarterly basis and this information assists in enforcing housing standards.  In addition, details of new rent supplemented tenancies are given to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to ensure that those tenancies are registered by landlords.  The Deputy will be aware that it is the revenue generated from PRTB registration which supports the inspection of accommodation.The basic problem is that people who are living on rent supplement in the long term ought to be doing so directly via the local authority in the area where they are living.  Rent supplement was only ever designed to be short term for people in rented accommodation who had suddenly lost their jobs and were looking forward to getting another job quickly.  The rent supplement was to tide them over for a short period of unemployment.

Within my area the waiting list for public housing at the moment can be anywhere between six and nine years.  Because of that many people are seeking refuge in the private rented sector.  The website to which the Minister referred, which provides information on the quality of rented accommodation, tells its own story.  Last year, less than 20 cases were taken by local authorities against landlords for providing sub-standard accommodation.It is evident to anyone who looks around the inner city of Dublin at the moment that this model is not working.  There is a large amount of rental property that is not meeting the criteria set out by local authorities.  On the North Circular Road alone, 84% of properties have multiple occupancy and a large number of them do not meet the criteria set out by law.  Many of those properties have tenants who are in receipt of rent supplement.  We need to either give more power to local authorities or they need to be incentivised to use existing powers to tackle the problem.  We are seeing pervasive urban decay that is affecting tenants and other residents.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I know the North Circular Road area very well.  I am aware from the external appearance that issues potentially arise with much of the accommodation ones sees on the road.  The solution is to transfer over a period responsibility for rent supplement so that in future it would be overseen by the local authority.  As Deputy Donohoe is probably aware, in some cases people refuse offers of decent accommodation in good local authority houses in favour of private rented accommodation.  That does not happen as much in Dublin but more so in some areas outside of Dublin.We need to integrate housing provision schemes.  The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, has great potential.  After I became Minister I met local authority managers and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and Deputy Penrose when he was Minister of State with responsibility for housing to see whether we could work in a co-ordinated way over a period to improve the situation described by Deputy Donohoe.We must also ensure that all landlords are properly registered, that we have their PRSI numbers and that they pay tax.  The Department of Social Protection is currently paying for half the private rented accommodation in the country, for more than 95,000 people, and the cost is well over €500 million.  The cost to the taxpayer is very high.  We will be able to find a better solution when we transfer more of the tenancies.  At the moment the desire is that anyone who is on rent supplement for more than 18 months should go into a local authority, RAS-type situation.  However, that is taking a great deal of time to achieve.  One of the problems compounding the situation is that local authorities have approximately 88 separate schemes of differential rent, so when people move from one scheme to another the IT systems do not talk to each other.  It is extremely difficult to deal with the issue but it is an area I hope to see progressed.A working group from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection meets regularly to try to see whether we can transfer more tenancies at a faster rate to local authorities, which will then have a much more direct interest in the quality of the accommodation.  By and large, community welfare officers, who are now employees of my Department, and social welfare officers are not skilled in the area of inspecting property.  It is not something they have done.  This is a function that should be carried out by the housing departments of local authorities.  They are the people with the skills.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I very much welcome the opportunity to raise this concern which I share with many others, namely, the proposal by NAMA to sell 750 houses at terms which give buyers, in effect, a 20% discount.I appreciate that the scheme is dressed up as one which offers insurance to buyers against a fall in the value of the property in the five-year period subsequent to the sale, but the reality is that by deferring 20% of the market price it acts as a subsidy because the down side risk of any house purchase nowadays is factored into the market price.  That is the whole problem with the housing market at the moment, and one of the reasons it has not bottomed out.I have a number of concerns on this issue.  The first is that it exposes the taxpayer to further risk.  The taxpayer who paid to buy the original loan on the asset is now being asked to subsidise the sale of the asset as well.The argument that the sale would generate VAT revenue and that the most taxpayers could lose would be €65 million is utterly spurious.  There would be VAT revenue and no risk if the houses were sold at whatever the market would bear, however low that might be.My second concern is the market manipulation of house prices, which is precisely what caused our current economic woes and is totally contrary to current Government policy.  It artificially inflates the notional value of a house.  This is a complete distortion of the housing market and prevents, or at least postpones, the return to any kind of a real market for houses, whatever that level may be.My third concern is related.  It is the damaging impact on other house sales and on the hapless owners, many of whom are in negative equity, who wish to sell their houses.  These houses are, in many cases, similar to the NAMA properties and sometimes even next door to them.  These vendors now find their homes unsaleable at the market price because the house next door is being sold 20% cheaper.  Similar houses, which are privately owned and being privately sold are devalued by 20%.  In fact, the entire housing market will now be benchmarked by this extraordinary device.  It is totally artificial and is not what the housing market needs at present.NAMA believes it does not need Government approval for this scheme and I know its powers are considerable.  However, it does have a responsibility, as we do, to protect the interests of taxpayers.  I do not believe this scheme does that.  In fact, it is against the interests of taxpayers and I ask the Minister to consider the implications of this further exposure of taxpayers.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for her reflective remarks concerning the proposal the chief executive officer of NAMA has made to the Minister for Finance.  My understanding from the Minister is that the chief executive of NAMA has sought his agreement to the introduction of a deferred consideration mortgage initiative by the agency in respect of its domestic residential property portfolio.The proposal is one of a range of initiatives that NAMA is examining with a view tomaximising the return on its asset portfolio.  Prior to its submission to the Minister, I am informed that the initiative had been approved by the NAMA board.  The details of the initiative are currently being reviewed within the Department and the Minister will respond to NAMA when that review has been completed.The broad concept is that NAMA will offer a limited price protection — 20% of the purchase price for five years — to buyers of its housing stock.  The limited protection will be 20% of the purchase price for five years.  It proposes that it will be apply to 750 units with an estimated value of about €150 million.  This means that a buyer would pay 80% of the purchase price up-front, funded by a 10% deposit and a first mortgage tranche of 70%.  A second tranche of 20% would be payable in five years to the extent that the property value had not fallen at that stage.NAMA will not be providing the finance directly.  Rather it will work with existing mortgage providers.  In this context the CEO of NAMA recently said the agency has had detailed discussions with AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  He also stated the agency had asked the other banks, through the Irish Banking Federation, if they wished to participate.  Any mortgage provider participating in the initiative would issue the mortgage with its own underwriting criteria.  The mortgage provider must commit to the second tranche at the outset, subject only to the final property value.While some commentators and analysts have suggested that the initiative could artificially support house prices, NAMA has engaged consultants to complete an economic study of the potential impact of the initiative.  It concludes that the most probable impact will be to accelerate movement towards a natural price floor.  The agency also suggests that an alternative strategy of non-intervention could lead to a prolonged period of stagnation, with potential buyers continuing to defer purchases.  In support of this, the NAMA CEO recently pointed out that in the first half of 2011, only €1.2 billion in mortgages were drawn down, which suggests that draw-downs for the year as a whole could be around half of the €4.5 billion figure which was Goodbody Stockbrokers' prediction at the start of the year.It is in all our interests that every effort be made to get the market moving again, with prices set at realistic levels.  For example, NAMA's experience with one developer whom it instructed, on foot of an agreement reached with him, to reduce the price of houses in a development built three years ago, was that over the course of two weekends some 20 of the houses in question were sold.  This confirms that the market is quite price sensitive.Overall, NAMA is focused on managing its assets to achieve the best possible return for taxpayers without engaging in the dumping or speculative hoarding of property assets.  In this regard, NAMA believes the deferred consideration initiative will protect portfolio value and optimise taxpayer benefit better than a non-intervention strategy.There are risks associated with the initiative, as the Deputy rightly pointed out in her contribution.  In discussions with the Department of Finance, NAMA has sought to address these risks.  NAMA also has assured the Minister that it will limit the initiative so that its scale will not create significant market distortion or artificial price support.  However, the initiative is still being considered and the Minister will reply to NAMA when those considerations are complete.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I accept that the motivation behind this proposal is to find an ingenious way of getting the market going again, disposing of properties and recouping the taxpayers' outlay.  I remind the Minister of State and the House that NAMA is the largest property owner in the world.  While the initial sale is of a mere 750 houses it is to be extended to 5,000, and the potential damage of that number of sales is enormous and will be enduring.  Apart from the impact of the subsidy on price, there will be a huge impact on the volume of other sales.  Incredibly, it seems that NAMA is now going to facilitate the provision of finance, as the Minister of State has said, through the three named banks.  At best, this will absorb almost all the available bank mortgages, leaving no finance for private sellers and buyers.  At worst, I suspect that NAMA will, effectively, provide some kind of mortgage insurance for the banks, which disadvantages other sellers and buyers and distorts the market.This is another unquantifiable risk being piled on the backs of taxpayers and is not in accordance with the mandate of NAMA, which is to protect taxpayers.  The scheme should not be allowed to proceed, at least without pause for thought about its implications.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank the Deputy for the points she has made in this short debate.  She has done a great service to the House in raising these issues.On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I remind the House that the matter is under consideration.  When NAMA wrote to the Minister it sought his agreement and that of the Government to the proposed initiative.  In all of these matters, a balance must be struck between trying to maximise the potential return for taxpayers, through NAMA, on the sale of these assets and trying to get the property market going again.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, there is no market currently.  We all have a vested interest, in terms of our pensions, the future of the country and the construction industry, in making sure we get to the bottom of the bottom of the housing market.  Whether that can be done through this scheme is a matter on which the Minister has yet to come to a final view.It is my understanding from NAMA that a total of 10,000 properties currently exist on its portfolio.  Of these, 8,000 are apartments and 2,000 are more traditional semi-detached and detached houses.  I do not think the 8,000 apartment units would be part of this tranche, because the current demand is for more conventional houses.We will work with NAMA to see the best option.  The Deputy has, rightly, stated the concerns attached to this proposal and these are matters on which the Minister will reflect before coming to a final decision.  I appreciate the Deputy's remarks.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	339	Many are calling the events in Egypt a second revolution.  I offer my full support to ordinary young people and workers in Egypt who are attempting to conclude the process started earlier this year with the overthrow of President Mubarak, an ally of successive US Administrations.  The repression he imposed and the global economic crisis kicked off the revolutionary process earlier this year and raised the hopes of many ordinary people for fundamental change.  The road to genuine freedom and democracy was not being blocked by just one man and his cronies but by an entire military cast and capitalist interests.  The military's failure to hand over power and its unleashing of repressive measures in excess of President Mubarak's have caused outrage across the globe.  In recent days thousands of activists have fought running battles with state forces over the control of Tahrir Square. Some 33 people have been killed and almost 2,000 seriously injured.  The military has extended the 30-year state of emergency, with arbitrary detention being the norm and some 12,000 civilian critics facing military tribunals.While we have seen the beginnings of a crack in the regime, clearly the situation is serious.  The efforts of ordinary people to secure a decent future must progress.  I, therefore, support the call for the holding of urgent genuine elections, which would constitute the first step of a process to improve democratic rights and ensure a better future for the ordinary people of the region.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I call on the Government, in particular the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to condemn immediately, clearly, unequivocally and publicly the Egyptian military regime for the massacre of 33 protestors in Tahrir Square during the weekend and as many as 50 protestors in the past week or two.  I also ask the Government to call publicly and unequivocally for the military clique surrounding Field Marshal Tantawi, a thug of President Mubarak, to step down, relinquish power to the civil authorities and give an immediate undertaking that democratic elections will be allowed to take place and that those elected will have full power without military intrusion.  Will the Tánaiste call in the Egyptian ambassador who is located on Clyde Road in Ballsbridge to tell him that, unless there is a clear undertaking from the Egyptian authorities that they will end the repression of the democratic revolution in Egypt immediately, he will be expelled from Ireland and that we will sever diplomatic and other ties with the regime?Will the Government speak out about the involvement of the United States through its continuing arming and support of the military clique responsible for the massacre during the weekend?  Will the Government make public statements and call in the Saudi ambassador to question him on his country's financing of Salafi gangs which are whipping up sectarian conflict between Christians and Muslims and focusing vicious attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt in an attempt to disorganise and divide the country's democratic forces?These are important steps that the Government could take to support the democratic revolution in Egypt, which is of historical importance.  If the revolution is defeated, it will set back the cause of democracy in the Middle East for many years to come.  The Government must side publicly with the protestors who are laying down their lives in the fight for democracy, justice and equality in Egypt.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14231	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Like many in the international community, the Government has been closely following events in Egypt in recent days in the run-up to historic parliamentary elections which are due to get under way on 28 November.  We all recall the events last February in Tahrir Square which proved so inspiring, when the discredited government of former President Hosni Mubarak was swept away in an impressive demonstration of people power.  In the intervening nine months, Ireland and its EU partners have been monitoring closely the transition to democratic rule in Egypt.  We have been offering all possible political support and responded positively to requests for practical assistance.  It is recognised that, as in other countries undergoing democratic transformation in the region, the uprising in Egypt that ended President Mubarak's rule was a genuinely popular one, drawing support from all sectors of society, and that it is for Egypt itself to determine the pace of its own transition and how the international community can best assist.It needs to be recognised that profound and historic changes have taken place in Egypt during the past nine months.  The country is on the verge of holding its first genuinely free elections in many years.  Political parties have been openly campaigning, many of which, including those linked with the Muslim Brotherhood, would only have encountered repression previously.  The former President and his close associates have been publicly put on trial for their crimes, an event to behold for ordinary Egyptians when they consider how impregnable the rule of President Mubarak appeared just one short year ago.Despite this, concern has been growing in recent months at the overall slow pace of the transition in Egypt and the degree of real change and reform taking place.  Despite repeated requests from the European Union and others, the ruling Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has refused to lift the long-standing state of emergency.  As a hard hitting Amnesty International report has highlighted in recent days, we have continued to see large-scale trials of civilians in military courts, as well as many credible reports of arbitrary detention and torture.Also of considerable concern has been the growth in sectarian tension.  This had its most recent manifestation last month, when more than 20 people, mostly Coptic Christians, were killed after coming under attack from elements linked with Egyptian security forces.  The military authorities have undertaken to investigate these deaths fully and also promised legislation to address well founded Coptic grievances.  As with other aspects of the change agenda in Egypt, the pace of reform has been slow and hesitant.Most recently, the prospect of military rule continuing until well into 2013 has caused renewed apprehension among many ordinary Egyptians, as well as Egypt's international partners.  That this and other failures to realise the full promise of change have given way to renewed violence and deaths is regrettable.  The Government joins others in the international community such as High Representative Ashton and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in expressing our deep concern about and condemnation of the violence in Tahrir Square and other parts of Egypt that is now estimated to have claimed at least 33 lives.The need for restraint, an avoidance of all violence and renewed dialogue on all sides is obvious.  There is no doubt that excessive force has been used by the Egyptian police and security forces in responding to what are peaceful demonstrations in Tahrir Square and other Egyptian cities.  The clear impetus behind all the renewed violence and tensions of recent days is the failure to respect fully the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people.  High Representative Ashton has warned that the demands of ordinary Egyptians and their political parties for a progressively unfolding transition that will safeguard the principles of democracy must be listened to.The head of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces in Egypt, Field Marshal Tantawi, has undertaken to advance the date for the presidential election to next July.  He has also held out the prospect of a referendum on the military continuing to play a political role in Egypt.  A new government is also likely to be formed.  This is a step forward, but considerably more remains to be done if the democratic promise of last February's Tahrir Square revolution is to be fulfilled and if a genuine process of democratic change akin to what is being observed in Tunisia and Libya is to get under way.  The Government will continue to work with our EU and international partners to assist Egypt along the path towards democratic transformation.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It is too early for the Minister of State to use Libya as an example.  It is interesting that he says Egypt can determine the pace of its transition when different criteria were set down in the case of Libya.  Western imperial powers stood back and propped up President Mubarak during the years to allow him to use brute force on his population and the West did not care as long as its interests were being protected.  The West would be quite happy with any regime in the area if it was capable of keeping a lid on matters.  Soundings of concern at this stage are the result of the people putting the spotlight on their oppression, on which the eyes of the world have focused the eyes.  Ordinary people are instinctively opposed to a constitution drawn up by the military and they are correct.  Rapid elections are needed.  However, a democratic parliament that involves people from below is also needed, as is a programme to tackle economic questions giving rise to such strife and sectarianism at grassroots level.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Giving dates for elections does not impress me or the Egyptian people because elections were held under President Mubarak.  The problem was that the Mubarak clique continued to rule with an iron fist.  All political opposition was suppressed violently.  Giving dates for elections means nothing, therefore; it is a charade while the military clique retains power which it uses to crush political opposition.  It is necessary for the Government to publicly condemn the military's repression of the democracy movement, call in the ambassador to demand that the military regime state it will relinquish power to the civil authorities and identify a date this year.  This includes releasing political prisoners and bringing the suppression of the protests to an end.The Government should also call in the Saudi ambassador.  The Minister of State referred to groups of thugs attacking Coptic Christians; they are being financed by elements of the Saudi regime.  There is a conspiracy involving certain forces in the region, backed up by the United States, which do not wish to see a genuine democracy in Egypt.  I appeal to the Government to show publicly that it is on the side of the people by making concrete demands to bring about the realisation of the aims of the democratic revolution in Egypt.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14231	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The question for Ireland, the European Union and the wider international community is how best we can support the Egyptian people along the path towards full and a genuine democracy.  The first step in that process is the holding of parliamentary elections which are scheduled to take place next Monday.  The Government has committed €250,000 to the United Nations' development programme to support the electoral process in Egypt in the coming months and help to create a genuine and deep democracy that is respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms.High Representative Ashton was the first major international figure to visit Egypt.  She went to listen to the Egyptian people about how the European Union could support Egypt's transition to democracy.  The Union has promised greater political association, economic integration, mobility and financial support for Egypt and other countries experiencing democratic transition in return for real reforms.  It has made available €350 million until the end of next year to support the process of democratisation and the achievement of economic growth throughout the region.It is for Egyptians to determine their future.  In partnership with the European Union, Ireland can continue to accompany the Egyptian people in their praiseworthy efforts to build what we all want to see, a democratic Egypt, in order that its people can fulfil the basic aspiration of a better life and have the opportunity to fulfil their potential.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has absolutely no excuse for refusing to meet the residents of Priory Hall.  He offered the excuse that related issues were before the courts.  He also claimed that it was solely a matter for Dublin City Council.  Neither of these excuses is valid.  There is nothing in law and no court order to stop the Minister from sitting down with residents to address the issues involved.  If it was occurring in his constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, he would be talking to or meeting them outside the gates of Leinster House, irrespective of whether a Supreme Court appeal was pending.  Mr. Justice Kearns, President of the High Court, has stated the various branches of government, including the Department and the city council, should be putting their heads together to find a solution.This issue is bigger than Dublin City Council.  It is a national issue, with implications for planning and development, fire safety regulations, on-site building inspections and the functions of local and central government.  In court counsel for Dublin City Council stated responsibility lay with the Department.  However, the Minister has said it lies with the city council.  The Priory Hall evacuees are being kicked like a football between the two agencies.  Hundreds of people have had to be evacuated from Priory Hall and are living in emergency accommodation.  They do not know what the immediate or long-term future holds for them.  They have received widespread support from people across the city and the country, including from individuals disgusted at the conduct of the corrupt developer, Tom McFeely of Coalport, and the failure of the system of regulation and enforcement that allowed this disaster to happen.It is shameful that the residents of Priory Hall have been refused a meeting with the Minister.  They had to protest outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday and some colleagues and I joined them in solidarity.  They should not have had to picket to demand a meeting with the Minister.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I would also like the Minister and the Taoiseach to step up to the plate, as I said on the Order of Business.  We need a senior Government figure, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to become directly involved.  I also met a delegation from Priory Hall yesterday.  I sensed their grave anxiety as they wondered whether they would be homeless for Christmas and what would happen about their mortgages and the payment of rent.  We are in a legal no man's land between the High Court and the Supreme Court.  People are concerned that the buildings were damaged when Thomas McFeely went in to undertake some remediation works, as one block has been left exposed to the elements.What can the Minister tell us about the discussions that have taken place with Dublin City Council?  The city council keeps telling us that it is in daily contact with the Department.  It is incumbent, therefore, on the Minister and the Taoiseach to take a hands-on approach.Most of the residents do not want to go back to Priory Hall.  They want a solution.  Owner-occupiers bought apartments in good faith; they were robbed of their life savings and submitted to taking out huge loans.  They were left in a dreadful position.  Those who privately rent are in a similar position.  Effectively, they have been left homeless.During the hearing in the High Court Mr. Justice Kearns repeatedly drew attention to the severe plight of the 240 residents and stated the behaviour of Dublin City Council "beggars belief" because the council had launched a torpedo but did not have the wherewithal to make alternative plans to remediate the complex, carry out repairs and rehouse residents.  Ms Sineád Power, one of the leading members of the Priory Hall committee, continually says that because of the liaison between Dublin City Council and the Department, this is a political issue.  Repeatedly in court barristers representing the council and others this situation requires a political solution.  I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns of the High Court for his diligence, legal clarity and empathy with the people.  He is a recommendation for the Judiciary.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I will respond to this issue on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.Dublin City Council is the designated authority with powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under the Fire Safety Act, the Building Control Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which are at issue in relation to Priory Hall.  The council is also the designated housing authority under the Housing Acts.  The Minister and the Department must respect the independence of the designated statutory authority in these matters and cannot interfere in individual cases.  The Minister's responsibility is to ensure that appropriate statutory requirements, technical standards and administrative provisions are put in place under the various Acts.  This responsibility has been fulfilled and is not in dispute.  The Minister has no role in enforcement activity or the direct provision of housing services.Residents at Priory Hall and their representatives have previously been advised of this clear division of responsibilities.  The consistent advice given has been that the appropriate statutory powers in this case rest with Dublin City Council and that neither the Minister nor the Department has a statutory function in enforcement activity or in determining the provision of services in individual cases.  This is and will remain the position.  While this may be a source of disappointment to the residents, it is important that the Minister act appropriately and within his powers, particularly in cases such as this which are already the subject of legal proceedings.Notwithstanding this clear division of responsibilities, the Department is being been kept informed by Dublin City Council of developments with regard to the resolution of issues at Priory Hall.  At the Minister's request, the Department has assisted the council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative housing for many of the residents.  The overriding priority is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as early as possible a return to their own homes.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  The Minister has asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and has asked the Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.The Minister believes that Dublin City Council deserves much credit for the efforts it has made on behalf of the affected residents and he urges the Council to continue to meet and communicate with the residents and to take all reasonable steps to support them while they are vulnerable.  The legal proceedings relating to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be entirely inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.On the North Fringe, specific responsibility for the planning and delivery of this development rests with the local authorities involved, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.

They were not asking him to interfere in the courts procedure but to listen to their problems.  They are still paying mortgages.  In some cases there is a three month moratorium but what will happen after three months?  Mr. McFeely has damaged the properties in one block, which is now completely exposed since Dublin City Council had him removed from the site.What will Dublin City Council do about the building control investigation that was completed on 16 November?  What other non-fire issues is the council aware of because there is no doubt there are other examples, such as Balgaddy.  Dublin City Council, in appealing the High Court's order to provide accommodation to residents, is causing people to fear that they will be left homeless.  These people must get a guarantee that they will not be left homeless no matter what happens.  Christmas is coming and people are terrified of where they will end up.

Does the Minister of State know if there will be legal action on foot of the building control report?  Has Dublin City Council given a breakdown of the costs of accommodation, legal costs and the total bill to the council and, therefore, to the State and the people we represent for this mess at Priory Hall?The developer, Mr. Tom McFeely, owns 68 of the properties in the complex.  Does the Minister know if any negotiations on those properties are under way whereby they could be made part of any contribution the developer must make to rebuild the complex?  Given that people were defrauded here, has the Government requested the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation or the Criminal Assets Bureau to look into this to see how the public interest may be progressed?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	353	On Deputy Ellis's suggestion that the Minister meet the residents to be made aware of the issues that have arisen in Priory Hall, I assure him he is more than aware of all of the problems arising at Priory Hall.  The Department will liaise with the city council on an ongoing basis to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as quickly as possible a return to their homes or, as was suggested in the earlier debate, an alternative to returning, whichever is the most reasonable and optimum outcome for the households concerned.Substantial works must be undertaken before that can happen and the city council is making every effort to achieve this objective.  I urge all concerned in Dublin City Council to deal with the situation in line with the standard arrangements in place for the discharge of their statutory functions.  Given that the matter is now in the hands of the High Court and moving on to the Supreme Court, it is important for all concerned to await the outcome of the court's deliberation.Since taking office, the Minister has clearly signalled consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings is a priority for him.  In this regard, he announced in July a number of measures to be advanced by his Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with and oversight of the requirements of the building regulations.Deputy Ellis mentioned that there may be other issues in other developments across Dublin and elsewhere.  On that basis, the Minister will introduce mandatory certification and improved inspection arrangements as key reforms that will be in place early next year and will improve the quality of buildings while ensuring problems like that those that arose at Priory Hall will never arise again.The Minister has publicly articulated his views on the role played by construction professionals and industry interests in certifying the building works at priory hall and he finds it dismaying to witness the lack of attention being paid to this aspect of the problem by commentators in general.Deputy Broughan asked about the mortgage moratorium being considered by the credit committee.  I will ask about that and come back to the Deputy on the issue.  All avenues are being pursued to ensure any costs arising from the cases and for repairs to the building so homeowners can return, will be reclaimed from those responsible for getting us into this sad and sorry mess in the first place.  If there is any other information that can be provided to the Deputies, I undertake to get it to them as quickly as possible.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	357	It is like many of the votes I needed on the last occasion; they were not transferred as one would have wished.I spoke about the potential impact of the budget and further cost increases on the road haulage business.  In recent weeks, I spoke to tour bus operators and their representatives throughout the country.  They, in addition to hauliers, have expressed very serious concern over the Government's expected decision to increase the rate of VAT on diesel.  They referred also to other potential increases, for example, increases in the duty on diesel and the rate of carbon tax.The operators have made it very clear to me that rising costs will have an impact on the dispersal of tourists around the country.  As the Minister is well aware, Dublin Airport is the entry point for many tourists.  They use the capital as a base and then take bus and coach tours to various destinations.  Some of these tours are one day in duration and others are longer.  There is real concern in the industry that if the cost of travel increases, there will be an impact on tourism activity, including regional tourism.  The Minister, who is responsible for tourism in addition to transport, has a role in making the case to ensure the appropriate dispersal of tourists around the country.  He will be familiar with the Cliffs of Moher in the constituency with which I am most familiar.  It is often a disappointment for tourism operators in the region that people travel there on a day basis.  This has been the case for some time.  It is, however, better than their not travelling to the region at all.  Any increase in cost will have an impact.The tourism sector is concerned that any additional cost, including a regulatory cost, that may arise from this Bill will have an impact on the coach tour market, which constitutes a separate category within the sector.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to review this Bill and any other to come before the House to ensure there will not be a greater burden of cost imposed on a sector that is already under pressure.  If the policy of this Government is to corral the bulk of tourists into the capital city, it is going the right way about it by making national tours cost prohibitive.I return to the provisions of the Bill.  The Schedule sets out the exemptions from the requirement to have a licence.  The list appears to be quite exhaustive but when one compares it to the list in the current A Guide to Road Haulage Operator Licensing, one notes some that are not in the legislation.  The guide states that a road haulage operator's licence is not required if one proposes to carry, in the State only, the following goods: cattle, sheep, pigs, turf; livestock by farmers for neighbours locally; milk to a creamery or a cream separating station; separated milk from a creamery or cream separating station; milk containers to or from a creamery or a cream separating station; newly harvested wheat, oats or barley during the period 1 August to 30 November.  These are provided for in the existing guidelines but there is no reference to them in the Bill.  Does the Minister intend to table an amendment to include them?  Am I to take from their omission that they are no longer covered?  Will the Minister clarify this?Sections 2 and 3 set out the obligation on the operator to inform the Minister of convictions of certain named individuals in the sector.  This only applies to passenger transport operations.  Why is this the case?  The Minister sets out the offences very clearly.  They include murder, manslaughter, certain non-fatal offences against the person, drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, certain sexual offences, certain firearms offences and aiding and abetting perpetrators of all these offences.  This is a reasonably exhaustive list of the serious crimes the Minister has rightly identified as not being helpful in establishing the repute of certain important players in the passenger transport industry, be it the transport manager, director or other individual.  A driver comprises an integral part of the industry.  While the Minister clearly states the necessity to notify the authorities of certain convictions in respect of transport operations, he does not do so in respect of road haulage operations.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility for a convicted owner-operator or director of a road haulage company to resign as a director and then become a driver.  I presume there is a good reason this is possible.  Will the Minister outline it?Section 3 sets out the obligation to inform the operator of certain convictions.  The requirement is imposed on the individual concerned, be it the transport manager or otherwise.  I would have believed a driver would also be obliged to inform the operator of any convictions he might have.  While I accept the requirement applies in respect of passenger transport operations, it does not apply in respect of haulage operations.  Why can the provision not extend to hauliers of goods?  Ultimately the Minister has discretion in section 4 to refuse or withdraw a license based on the good repute, or otherwise, of the operator.  In the event of a failure to establish the operator's good repute, and when there is no obligation on both the driver and operator, the Minister will not be in a position to establish the full bona fides of the operator and driver.  Will the Minister clarify why a driver who transports goods is not seen as an integral part or major component of the operation?  I cannot understand why that is not the case and am, therefore, clearly missing something.Concern has been raised over own-account operators.  Approximately 60% to 70% of haulage vehicles are owned by such operators.  They engage in the transport of their own goods with their own vehicles and are, therefore, not subject to the provisions requiring that one have a licence.  There is a view that some of the bad publicity associated with the haulage sector is associated with the own-account sector based on the supposition that inspections of own-account operators and vehicles are not as rigorous as they might be.  Has the Minister any plan to introduce a licensing regime for the own-account sector?  I understand that, in other jurisdictions, legislative provision is made for the licensing of own-account operators.  It is not a huge issue but it is a question of ensuring uniformity of approach to safety regulation and management.  I would be grateful if the Minister addressed the concerns I have raised.  While I have certain concerns about the Bill, I do not intend to delay its passage and will assist in whatever way I can.  If the Minister can assure us that the gaps we have identified will form part of the Bill he has proposed to introduce at a later date, we will accept his commitment.  I also ask him to indicate when he proposes to bring that legislation before the House.  Time is of the essence, particularly in regard to the issue of cabotage and the distortion of competition among Irish road hauliers.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I will share my time with Deputy Martin Ferris.I welcome the Road Transport Bill 2011 in so far as it deals with the character of licence holders and the people they employ in a similar manner to the legislation on private security firms.  I ask the Minister to consider updating the taxi regulation legislation to put in place a similar regime to ensure the reputation of that industry and protect the safety of customers, pedestrians and other road users.  The Bill provides for a number of housekeeping reforms in the area of road transport.  I have little difficulty with the intentions behind the Bill.However, I will table an amendment on Committee Stage on behalf of Sinn Féin.  Under the Good Friday Agreement signed by the Government of this State in 1998, this House recognises: "the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training and/or reskilling, and further education."  The Agreement recognises the political context of the conflict which happened in Ireland between 1960 and its signing and that actions carried out by IRA volunteers were politically motivated.  As such, IRA prisoners were political prisoners and following the ceasefire they were released from prison as part of a process of peace building.  This has been a massive success for society, North and South.  We now have a more inclusive society in which sectarianism is on the back foot and the days of the orange state's oppression of the Nationalist people of the North is over.  There will be no more Bloody Sundays.Unfortunately, many former political prisoners are finding it difficult to secure a place in their communities, whether North or South.  Despite the conditions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Hillsborough Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, along with the guidelines that have been published subsequently, political prisoners continue to suffer discrimination.  Obstacles continue to be erected in the way of their search for employment or business opportunities.  This Bill neglects the plight of these ex-prisoners.  It puts in place rules which would make it difficult for them to obtain a road transport operator licence or work in a licence holder's business.I am a former political prisoner.  All my life I have worked for my community and I continue to work with local people for better services and to defend their rights.  In February 2011 I was elected to the Parliament of this State and, as a Deputy, I can speak on this Bill and table amendments to it.  I was elected with thousands of votes from the people of Finglas, Ballymun, Glasnevin, Whitehall, Beaumont and Santry.  However, if I seek a road transport operator's licence or a job with a licence holder, this would count for nothing.  Members from other parties have been imprisoned for political actions, including some of the Minister's colleagues in the Labour Party.There are thousands of former political prisoners in the State, the vast majority of whom are pillars of society.  They have obtained further educational qualifications and include in their number doctors of every subject one can imagine.  They are respected in their current fields of activity and they helped to build and keep peace.  The State has failed to comply with its end of the bargain in terms of respecting the political context of their imprisonment.  It alleges they are not of good repute.  Anyone who knows former political prisoners, works with them or has had any dealings with them will be aware this is not a fair claim.The St. Andrews Agreement, which progressed the peace process and brought about the renewal of power sharing, states: "[t]he Government will work with business, trade unions and ex-prisoner groups to produce guidance for employers which will reduce barriers to employment and enhance re-integration of former prisoners."  A working group established under the agreement to focus on the issues arising for prisoners stated: "that conflict-related convictions of ‘politically motivated' ex-prisoners, or their membership of any organisation, should not generally be taken into account [in accessing employment, facilities, goods or services] provided that the act to which the conviction relates, or the membership, predates the Agreement."The Government must uphold its side of the bargain with the prisoners who took risks for peace.  It must treat them fairly and allow them to live normal lives in this new dispensation, which they have played a major role in creating.  It is 13 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  It is time this commitment was part of all legislation dealing with this type of issue.  Sinn Féin cannot accept the Bill as long as it discriminates against former political prisoners in contravention of the principles set out in the Good Friday Agreement and its successors.  I ask the House to support this amendment so that the Bill can pass without delay.I take this opportunity to raise other issues with the Minister.  The Bill aims at improving safety on our roads by controlling who can hold a road transport operator licence, with the aim of filtering out undesirable elements.  I ask the Minister to consider an NCT system for motorbikes and scooters, such as Lambrettas and Vespas.  It is time we rolled out the NCT to all registered vehicles, whether trucks, cars or motorbikes.  Penalty points should also be introduced to deal with the illegal use of these vehicles for dumping or other offences.

At matters stand, Deputy Ellis, who was elected by the people of Finglas, and I, who was elected by the people of Kerry North-West Limerick, would not be able to get a taxi licence because we are former political prisoners.  It is amazing that more than 9,000 people could vote for me yet I would not get a licence.  If the same criterion applied to Deputy Durkan he would be unable to get a licence because he is also a former political prisoner, albeit in 1966.

The British and Irish Governments both gave commitments that once conditions had stabilised, legislation would be introduced to give an amnesty to anyone who had convictions during the struggle.  We took that in good faith and yet people who had convictions that occurred as a result of the Troubles in the Six Counties and were involved in the campaign still find themselves in this position of discrimination.  These are people who were sentenced in the Diplock courts in the North and the other non-jury courts in the Twenty-six Counties.  Under the special powers Act, those who were convicted received very long sentences and were released under the Good Friday Agreement on the recognition by both Governments that these were special category prisoners.In July I had the opportunity to go and speak in five cities in Australia.  In order to go there, I needed to get a certificate of compliance from the Garda containing all my previous convictions.  It effectively meant that I had to get a special visa in order to enter that country as I have had to do up until now in order to enter the United States of America, even though I was going there to promote the peace process and to convince people who had reservations about the whole peace process.  There are many others in similar positions.  It also means that, for instance, a person who was sentenced as a result of the Troubles and released 20 years ago cannot get a visa to go to the United States, Australia or Canada.  They cannot even go for a holiday to those countries because they have had these sentences as a result of the conflict.The Minister should accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Ellis.  If that amendment is accepted, some decent and honourable people would be able to get jobs in road transportation, as taxi drivers or any similar job.  Based on their previous conscience, I hope Deputy Durkan and other Members in government parties might be able to support the amendment.  I trust the Minister will take this on board.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I welcome the Bill as far as it goes, although I recognise its limitation because I gather it needs to be enacted by 4 December and the Minister is promising a much more comprehensive road transport Bill in the coming year, which will be welcome.  It is not fair to criticise the details of the Bill because we accept it is minimalist.  I take in good faith the Minister's promise to produce a more comprehensive and important Bill next year.I am somewhat staggered by the obvious need for the Bill.  Reading between the lines of what the Minister said, whereas he said there are approximately 7,000 licensed operators of approximately 25,000 large vehicles, we do not get a picture of the number of unlicensed operators or the number of vehicles on the roads that are operating either below par or without licences.  It would be very helpful to have that information.  Across Europe the problem is extensive and based on what we have heard from the Minister, it would seem self-evident that a large number of cowboys are operating in this market and need to be dealt with.I welcome the detailed provisions in the Bill.  It is important that those in this industry should be of good repute, which is the first principle of the Bill.  I welcome Internet access to the register which will provide greater accessibility.  There is an obvious need to update the penalties.  The staggeringly small penalties in this area were hardly a deterrent to people breaking the rules or becoming unlicensed operators.I was particularly interested to note that the Bill covers Bus Éireann.  I was not aware that Bus Éireann even needed to apply for a licence.  I would be interested to know how often it is required to apply for a licence and the terms under which it is granted.  I am concerned that the State sector may be the biggest cowboy in the transport industry.

If we are strict about our criteria towards the private sector, which I welcome, we should be equally strict about the criteria for giving licences to those involved in public sector transport.The two main principles of the Bill are that those operating in this area should be of good repute and should have a good safety record.  If Iarnród Éireann were to make an application, it should be refused on grounds included in the Bill because it is not an organisation of good repute.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	369	That is outrageous.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I do not say that without great consideration and without experience.  Deputy Dooley was on the committee of which I was a member and which certainly cast considerable doubt over the good repute of Iarnród Éireann.  I am not talking specifically about safety, although that should be mentioned.  The Minister will be aware of the disgraceful incident involving Iarnród Éireann — the Malahide viaduct case.  In 2009 the viaduct collapsed and it was quite obvious that safety rules had been neglected.  Lives could have been lost and it was a miracle that they were not.  If that sort of offence and negligence had occurred in rail or road transport in the private sector, anybody applying for a licence would undoubtedly have been refused at the next application.  We need to apply the same principles to the State sector, as the Minister mentions in terms of Dublin Bus, as we have in the private sector.Of course it is unthinkable that a State monopoly of that sort in practical terms should be refused a licence.  On the other hand, it is unthinkable that it should behave in the cavalier way it did and not be accountable for it.  Iarnród Éireann is a case in point.  It is not accountable and does not deserve to receive a licence under these criteria for several other reasons.  What was unveiled about Iarnród Éireann at that particular committee was devastating and proved conclusively that it was an organisation of ill repute.  It was an organisation not being run properly either for the benefit of the taxpayer or for the benefit of its customers.  I refer specifically to the Baker Tilly report with which the Minister will be familiar.  This report looked into the functioning of Iarnród Éireann and found evidence of backhanders, procurement breaches and theft inside this semi-State body.  Any damage that could have been done to the reputation of the company was done but the report was buried.  Iarnród Éireann is a sister company of Bus Éireann and CIE overlooks and supervises them but if can happen in Iarnród Éireann, it is questionable that the company should be given a licence.  That is a difficult reality to face but the chief rail operator in the State operates in a culture of secrecy and issues accounts, which are not transparent and are almost impossible to understand.  They did not reveal the fact that the company paid €500,000 for a report in which it is damned in every paragraph and, therefore, we have to ask whether it should have a licence.  I am interested in the Minister's response to that because there are equal requirements on the private and public sectors and just because a semi-State company is a State monopoly does not mean it should not meet the same high standards of safety and probity as a small operator giving little employment.I applaud the fact that the Bill has been introduced and that it applies to Bus Éireann but let the Minister in future be fair in his judgment of Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann, even if it is unthinkable to refuse a licence in both sectors.I am a little uneasy about the ministerial power provided for in the legislation.  My understanding is that all powers rest with the Minister of the day.  I acknowledge the power of appeal but the Minister has the power to refuse licences, to question offences committed and to even consider offences such as murder, drug trafficking and other political offences, to which my friends in Sinn Féin have referred.  The difficulty is that the Minister can make a subjective judgment on the so-called offences.  Such a power is open to political abuse, particularly in the case of people in Sinn Féin, but also in the case of giving commercial preference to people operating within the Minister's influence and sphere.  I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister would ever get involved in anything like that but law of this sort should be secure against future bad and corrupt Ministers who will abuse it.  The way the provision is phrased gives enormous potential for abuse politically and commercially.The Minister will not recall the time the Minister for Local Government had the power of appeal over planning permission.  That was abused by unscrupulous Ministers and I am worried, having listened to the contributions of Deputies Ferris and Ellis, that there is potential for political and commercial abuse in future in the powers given to the Minister in the legislation.  I ask him to give these powers to a more independent political person or institution.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  Mr. Gay Byrne, Mr. Noel Brett and the previous Minister were more interested in putting every rural driver off the road and they succeeded.  I met the former Minister last night and he is doing well in his retirement.  These men succeeded in closing rural Ireland and locking the gates.  Rural towns and villages are desolate, which is a travesty.I welcome what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill and his promise to introduce a more comprehensive Bill in the future.  Road safety is of paramount importance for every user, whether he or she is a pedestrian, tourist or a motorist.  I always acknowledged that when I opposed the Minister on issues relating to the Road Traffic Bill 2011.  I did not advocate breaking the law but there must be balance.  As Senator Ross stated, the powers in this legislation are draconian.  I do not cast aspersions on the Minister but we do not know what might happen with future Ministers.I refer to a road haulier in my county who employs 100 people and who featured in a "Prime Time Investigates" programme.  It is interesting that this has come to mind on the day the programme has rightly been stood down.  I wonder whether we will find out, as has happened with the newspapers in England, whether phones were tapped and other outrageous practices were carried out in the name of another bastion of our society, RTE.  "Prime Time Investigates" did a programme on road hauliers and their drivers.  While the programmers were entitled to do that, they have to abide within the law.  We have witnessed what they did elsewhere recently.I would like to revisit this programme and the outrageous attack on a businessman employing 100 people in Tipperary.  I will not point to the current Minister or the Minister at the time but to a senior official in the Department, whom I will not name but with whom I fought.  The haulier had a good reputation for 30 years, since licensing began, and he wanted to renew his licence, which must be done every five years.  His trucks were impounded in Europe because an official would not sign off on his licence.  The official had nothing to do only watch "Prime Time Investigates" and this was nothing short of blackguarding by a public official.  Unfortunately, it goes on all the time.  There are many good officials but this fellow sat in his armchair one night having come home from playing golf or whatever and watched the programme.  He then decided he would not give a licence to this company owned by a decent hard working man employing 100 people.  He was almost closed down.When the deadline arrived, I was told the official could not be found because he had been transferred to Nenagh and then to somewhere else.  I welcome the Government decision to scrap decentralisation because it was a hiding place for these faceless bureaucrats.  This senior official decided he was all powerful and would not renew the licence, despite the fact that the gardaí in Thurles, Tipperary town and Templemore had given the haulier the highest recommendation.  The trucks travelling to the continent for ten days needed licences.  They were pulled in by police and the drivers had to pay on-the-spot fines.  This almost brought the company to its knees.  It was pure, sheer blackguarding.  Deputy Ross's comments made me go down this track on this Bill because of the potential for wrongdoing and blackguarding by the Minister of the day or an official who is not accountable.  There is no accountability, even in RTE.  No one will be sacked or suffer wage cuts.  No one will be dealt with; we are the only people who have to face the public about this quango.  These people are above and beyond reproach.Deputy Ross also mentioned Iarnród Éireann and the Malahide viaduct.  There is a viaduct in my home town, Cahir, and it has collapsed twice in my lifetime.  I was only a kid when it collapsed first and there were fatalities but this time it collapsed with a train crossing it.  Thankfully, the train was almost over.  The back carriages fell down and the driver was able to hold the train on the track but there could have been awful consequences.  There is a lovely, scenic walk under that viaduct from where anybody can see that it is not in good condition.  One does need to be an engineer or an official.  It is an ornate limestone structure but stones are missing from the pillars.  They were put there by hand 200 or 300 years ago.  The viaduct has been neglected like many other structures overseen by Iarnród Éireann.  Many structures look decrepit and while I do not say they are unsafe, I question the practice of assessing them, who assesses them and what qualifications they have.  How can a structure that must bear such a load be assessed through a visual inspection?  Like Coillte and other bodies, Iarnród Éireann does not maintain properties because it does not have the staff; they are neglected.  I am worried about this.I support the Sinn Féin amendment and compliment my colleagues on putting it down.  Why should they now be penalised if they for the best of motives helped to fight and tried to seek the freedom of our country?  I am interested to hear from other colleagues.  If the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement are in place, this should be dealt with in the Bill and they should be allowed to take up whatever occupation is necessary and should not be victimised.I worry about the Garda vetting process.  Apart from the delays, the system is now decentralised in every county and Garda vetting no longer operates as it used to.  I was glad to see people from Cork today protesting about rural Garda stations.  The local garda knew everybody, which is the only way to vet people.  He knew a person's character and he knew the family.  Now, a person fills in a form but the garda does not know him, so Garda vetting is not worth the paper it is written on.  There is nobody a person can telephone to ask: "Who is Mattie McGrath?  Is he of good standing and has he done whatever?"  If some people had their way, I would not get a licence either.  I would have been away for a holiday as well, if some got their way, but thankfully the jury in my own constituency decided otherwise.  We must make haste slowly, as I often say.  This is a very tricky area and should be examined very carefully.I know something about the issue of school buses as my family were involved in this area.  Given the cuts and charges that have been imposed on students by this Government and the previous Government, the buses are now passing students' homes but they cannot afford to use them.  In addition, the whole area has been greatly opened up.  While there was a good relationship with Bus Éireann and the route licence holders, that is all gone and it is a case of undercutting, and Bus Éireann introduced its own cut last year.  People are now going in at prices at which they just could not provide a service.  There will be accidents, God help me, as I hate to say that, but short cuts are being taken.I spoke recently to a person who used to drive a big bus but was never checked.  If a bus driver refuses to drive a bus because it is unsafe, that person will simply be let go or moved out of the company.  There are no checks on Bus Éireann buses or many big passenger buses, just as it is with the taxis.  We entrust our lives and our families to large 55 seater buses but there are no proper checks on them, whether for Bus Éireann or private operators, which is very dangerous.  This is too important an area and must be examined very seriously.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Before I go into the detail of the legislation, I must say the recent Cabinet decision to exploit the principle of our quality bus corridors for ministerial car use is totally off the wall.  It is out of touch with the real world and it is an arrogance which shows how out of touch some of these Ministers are.  While I take the point that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, opposed it, we should all put down a marker on this issue.There is an urgent need for common sense in the context of the debate on this Bill and other debates on the transport issue.  It is an important debate as the whole issue of transport is an important part of our recovery, particularly getting the right infrastructure and, specifically in regard to the Bill, the right operators.  Let us remember in this debate that good practice has to be top of the political agenda.  When we examine the details of the Bill, we can see the issues emerging, as some of my colleagues have noted.The purpose of the Bill is to amend provisions in the Road Transport Acts, first, to give effect in primary legislation to a number of issues which are currently provided for in regulations but which will be affected by the coming into force of EU regulations and, second, to make provision for amendments to the so-called good repute aspects of road transport.  I want to focus on section 2, which deals specifically with the obligation on the operator to inform the Minister of certain convictions.  This requires an applicant or licensed operator to inform the Minister of certain serious convictions which apply to the operator, certain specified positions within the operation and to drivers with passenger transport operations.  Serious convictions, whether in Ireland or in another jurisdiction, are the following: murder; manslaughter; certain non-fatal offences against the person; drug trafficking; human trafficking, which has not been raised so far in the debate; certain money laundering offences; certain sexual offences; firearms offences; and aiding and abetting the above.This is an important section.  I have major concerns and strongly support it because of my experience of the drugs issue in particular and the transport of drugs into this country.  We have a major crisis whereby drugs are smuggled into the country in containers, vans and even potted plants, which is appalling.  This must be highlighted and I am glad it is being dealt with in the Bill.  There is also the issue of people being intimidated to carry drugs in their small business operations, which leads to crises within families and within communities.  A family member is told that if their van or truck is abroad, the person had better bring a load of drugs into Ireland, or else.  That kind of situation must be dealt with.I welcome and strongly support the Sinn Féin amendment as it deals with a seriously different situation.  We have made the Good Friday Agreement and we must stick to the reality of it.  In terms of peace building in this country, I see the amendment as part of the conflict resolution process.  I know there are people, particularly in the Twenty-six Counties, who have still not got over the fact we have the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, and that we have people on this island working hard every day to ensure they deliver on that process.  The recent presidential election highlighted for me that there is a mindset in the Twenty-six Counties that has a long way to go before we start developing conflict resolution and peace making on the island.  The Sinn Féin amendment deals specifically with this.I know many ex-prisoners, in particular some who are involved in the education sector, and I know the work they do in community and voluntary groups in the area of education and special needs.  I welcome the massive contribution to their country and society of ex-prisoners from the conflict in the North whom I have met in the past ten years.  Some of them have gone on to attain very high standards in third level education, with some becoming doctors and so on.  They have made and still have a major contribution to make to this country.  I strongly support this important Sinn Féin amendment.I referred to human trafficking, the discussion on which has gone quiet in the past year or two but which was a major problem some years ago when large sums of money were taken from poor families from abroad who wanted to get into Ireland during the Celtic tiger era.  Some of the incidents and cases, where people were squashed into containers and trucks, with some family members dying owing to lack of oxygen, were shocking.  We must be able to deal with such cases and ensure that those responsible do not get licences under the legislation.Crime is a huge issue in the area of transport, particularly in regard to drugs and human trafficking.  We must all be vigilant in this regard, in particular the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Garda and Customs and Excise.  There are still major problems, with huge gaps that have to be plugged.  I see this debate and the Bill as part of that, but the rest is down to hard work, effective implementation and good practice.  We must have the right people in the right positions to implement the legislation.  We all know there are very serious people still at large, and it is a very complex and dangerous issue.As I mentioned, the drug gangs exploit the transport industry and intimidate transport workers, and many innocent people have suffered.  I know of a case in which an innocent man with a family was detained in France because drugs had been found in one of his lorries.  He took the hit and was locked up for months before it was eventually proved that somebody else was involved and that he had been set up.  The tragedy and harm caused to his family and business was very upsetting for them.On the points made about Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann, when people make mistakes, it is important that they accept responsibility for them and that there is accountability.  I accept this, but I do not go along with the argument that everything in the private sector is rosy and that everything in the public sector is bad.  What we need in this modern society is good practice in the public and private sectors.  I strongly believe these are the issues we also have to examine.Deputy Shane Ross made a valid point about the Minister's powers being open to political abuse in the future.  He was not hinting at the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in this respect.  However, there were people who had a dodgy record and there are people who could be open to exploitation.  I also take the point that people could be damaged because of their political views.Section 10 deals with the issue of purporting to operate other than in accordance with the operator's licence.  It prohibits a person from advertising himself or herself as a licensed haulier when, in fact, he or she has no such licence.  We must have certain standards in this regard.Section 15 deals with prosecutions and body corporate offences.  It restates the existing standard provision relating to offences by bodies corporate.  It also provides that under the Bill an offence may be prosecuted by the Minister or the Road Safety Authority.  It is important that the Road Safety Authority is mentioned in regard to this issue because of its major influence and impact on transport issues.The overall objective of the Bill is to maintain in place current provisions relating to the licensing of transport operations for hire and reward.  I look forward to future legislation to be brought forward by the Minister.  I urge him to deal with the competitiveness issues, about which he spoke.  If we had better standards in this sector and there was easy availability of information on licensed operators, this would contribute to increased competitiveness in the State.  One of the tactics that will help us to get out of the economic crisis is improving our competitiveness, particularly as regards the operations of those directly involved in these small businesses.When the Sinn Féin amendment to the Bill is proposed, I  will strongly support it.  The party has a valid point.  We need to recognise that we have all moved on.  There has been a major change in this country in last few years and we need to bed down the peace process once and for all.I welcome the Bill and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me this opportunity to speak to it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The next speaker is Deputy Noel Harrington who I understand is sharing his time with Deputy Jerry Buttimer.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Yes, I am.I welcome the opportunity to address the Minister and thank him for his presence.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Many Members of this House travel the roads on a daily basis, clocking up many kilometres in the process.  I probably live the furthest away from Leinster House in that I have to travel 390 km each way door to door.  To be selfish about this, I declare an interest in that I hope I will make sure the roads other Members and I travel are safe; that drivers, particularly of heavy vehicles such as HGVs and buses, are competent, of good character and perform their work in the best possible and safest conditions on the roads.The Bill is being introduced on foot of EU regulations dealing with road transport operators who carry passengers and freight which will come into effect on Sunday, 4 December.  In that context, this is rushed legislation.  While it is never a good idea to rush legislation, I understand the Minister's point that, regrettably, we have no choice but to put this legislation through the Houses quickly to have it through by 4 December.The Bill presents an opportunity to reflect on the nature of the work hauliers, bus drivers and HGV operators do not only for themselves but also on behalf of the economy.  They are its lifeblood in terms of trade and the movement of passengers throughout the country.  We should not underestimate the important role they play in the economic life of the country and in terms of social well-being.One of the reasons the legalisation is being introduced is the awarding of a road transport operator's licence in June 2009 to a person who had been convicted of a serious criminal offence.  The regulations were later amended to prevent a person who had been so convicted from holding a licence for a period of two years following summary conviction, or five years following conviction on indictment of various stated acts.On a lighter note, I take the opportunity to raise a matter not clearly stated in the Bill, but sometimes it is nearly as important to examine what is not included in a Bill.  I ask the Minister to confirm something for me when replying.  For example, fishermen who have committed very minor offences have their first legal sitting at Circuit Criminal Court level and such an offence often leads to a criminal conviction.  If they were to move from the fishing industry, I ask the Minister to confirm that they would not be hit with such provisions under this legislation.  This is a bugbear of mine and I know other Deputies would raise the same issue.  Some of the secondary legislation in the form of statutory instruments has been repealed giving rise to the need for the Bill.  I understand it contains no time limit in respect of previous convictions and the Minister is now determining if this would be a disproportionate response considering the nature of the offences involved in deciding to grant or refuse a licence application.I take the opportunity to mention to the Minister that the previous Government had indicated its intention to introduce a spent convictions Bill to determine for how long a conviction should stand on a person's record.  With respect, I suggest the Minister might protect himself by drawing up guidelines or legislation for consideration on these matters that could be amended if such a Bill were to be passed by the House in the future.  There is a statistic to back up my suggestion.  Some 40% of those convicted of dangerous driving had previous convictions.  It is a startling statistic, one of which we should take note.Taking account of the work done and contribution made by such operators to the economy, I am concerned the Bill will add to the red tape small independent transport operators, in particular, will have to cut through before they will be able to operate.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the volume of red tape that has to be dealt with by operators and minimise it in any way he can to maintain a competitive advantage for our operators who work in tremendously difficult circumstances on local and regional roads which in many cases one could argue are not fit for purpose, particularly for the carriage of loads of 22 tonnes or 24 tonnes.  It would be remiss of me not to ask that the volume of red tape be examined.  I cite as an example restaurateurs who may well have to report to 20 agencies, which involves 20 examinations or inspections and the payment of 20 fees.  The amount of red table involved can be over the top for the people concerned, but I am cognisant of the need to maintain high standards of safety, competence and trust within the industry.  I hope the Bill will go a long way towards achieving this.Many local authorities are grappling with a decision taken by a previous Minister on the metrification of speed limits.  A default speed limit was set for roads throughout the country.  However, some of the patchwork efforts made within local authority areas have led to confusion and dangerous situations in some cases.  A HGV or bus operator, particularly when travelling in less familiar environments, may not be aware of the speed limit as it changes so often.  There is a good deal of road signage on local, regional and national roads but very few speed limit signs.  Perhaps there is a way to place fluorescent colour coding on much of that signage, which would indicate to experienced or professional drivers the speed limit zone they are in, rather than having to wait for the next indicated speed limit sign, particularly where speed limits no longer apply.I also wish to address some of the issues that have come to my office in recent months.  A major issue is with regard to competent commercial drivers returning to Ireland from the United States and Australia.  I know of a mature commercial driver who returned from the United States earlier this year and who holds licences to a very competent level.  He is licensed to drive motor cycles, cars, vehicles for up to 15 passengers and HGVs, and he has held these licenses accident-free for 20 years.  Because we do not have an exchange agreement with any of the United States he has been informed he must undertake driving lessons for each licence which will cost approximately €2,000.  Although the legislation does not provide for a change in this situation it must be examined if we are to deal with this in a rational and effective way.Another Irish national who worked for an international organisation linked with the United Nations held driving licences in 15 countries in the past 20 years.  His last post was in an eastern European country which does not have a driver licence exchange agreement with Ireland.  He must also undergo the same courses and lessons and pay the same fees.  This is very onerous, unfair and unreasonable.I also know of an Irish citizen who lives in Australia for six months of every year and who wishes to keep an Irish and Australian driving licence.  The person does not want to surrender the Australian driving licence for economic reasons.  There should be a way of recording convictions and penalty points in both jurisdictions.I do not suggest that Irish driving licences should be given out willy-nilly without tests, but we should have a basic competency test to ensure Irish people returning here are allowed to continue working as HGV operators.  The people in the examples I have given have no convictions or criminal records.  They have done nothing wrong.  All they have done is returned.  They are very competent in their work.  The only difference is they must drive on the left-hand side of the road.  I will continue to pursue these issues and I ask the Minister and the Road Safety Authority to deal reasonably with them as soon as possible.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I have not even started yet.There has been a two year delay in addressing this issue and we now have to deal with it at the last minute.  I am not blaming or criticising the Minister but it should not have taken this amount of time to deal with legislation.  The legal obligations of the State should not be dealt with at the eleventh hour; it is bad business and bad practice.I am glad the Bill is non-contentious because it is important that we bring about clarity.  It is also important that the Oireachtas is allowed time to consider and debate the matters addressed in the Bill.  We should consider whether the proposal is a fair way of implementing legislation.  This leads to questioning how we run the business of the House, and we are all obliged to do so.  We often seem to put EU legislation rulings to one side and hope they go away; they do not do so and we must recognise that they cannot do so.  I hope this Dáil will be more proactive in implementing EU legislation than the Oireachtas has been to date.The issue of hauliers has become very political in recent years.  I met a number of hauliers in Cork who are genuinely concerned about the plight of their industry and the way in which it is going.  The price of fuel has increased as has the cost of their insurance.  Fewer people are being employed in the industry due to the downturn in the economy and road conditions are not what they should be.  It is important to highlight that those who operate in the State are very important to our economy in the context of the movement of goods and people.  They are still significant employers.  We expect and demand the best from them and therefore it is incumbent on us to carry out our business transparently.Deputy Harrington raised the issue of red tape and this has been raised with me, particularly by small operators who are concerned about bureaucracy.  I hope the job of the Government will be to assist them and work with them in the implementation of legislation.I appeal to the Minister to leave the Jack Lynch tunnel without a toll.  It is a very important intersection and is a key part of the road and transport infrastructure in Cork.  It has served the city and county well.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	383	It is important that we work with the local authorities and people in Cork on this issue.Deputy Harrington raised the issue of fluorescent colour coding and people have raised this issue with me as they seek measures to prevent a decline in road safety.  Many of those to whom I have spoken have said it would be a way to assist drivers.  A tangential point on road safety is that our haulage drivers are very safe drivers with great road awareness and savvy.  They are also some of the most courteous drivers on the road.  Other people who use our roads should look at the hauliers as an example of how to conduct themselves.  I say this as somebody with no vested interest but who travels between Cork and Dublin every week and who recognises the importance of safety on our roads, in particular on the motorway between Cork and Dublin.  I commend our hauliers for this.The Bill targets the owners and operators of vehicles for transporting goods for hire or reward, and we expect high standards and proper behaviour.  It is important that we communicate and engage sufficiently with those involved in the business.  This will allay some of the fear and suspicion people have.  If we have a vibrant and strong road transport sector which engages with the Government and participates, we will find that legislation coming before the House will be enhanced by this participation.The transport of goods by rogue operators must be addressed and to this end it is important that we welcome the more vigilant approach and proactivity by the customs service and the Garda.  This may not be a popular thing to say.  In imposing larger fines, a stricter regime will force people to think before acting illegally.  Anecdotally we are told that the black economy is increasing in certain sectors; therefore, it is incumbent on the Government and this House to ensure it does not flourish and prosper.I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  It is essential that we do not allow European directives to be left until the last minute before dotting the i's and crossing the t's.  It has to be done better than this.  Whether it is because of a cynical relationship with the European Union or because we think it might go away, the reality is that we are now a part of the Union.  As EU directives have consequences and implications, it is critical for us to work in partnership with Europe rather than in isolation.  By working in collaboration with Europe we can bring about change, including a better cohesion in the implementation of policy for all concerned.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I welcome the Bill and share Deputy Buttimer's concerns about the rush involved.  However, I welcome the fact that the Minister is committed to introducing a much wider road transport Bill next year.  I will address a few matters concerning that later.Given the importance of trade and the transportation of goods across Europe towards making that trading area work, it is surprising that we are only now introducing these directives across the European Union.  It looks relatively simple but we have a fantastic record in this country of making simple things complicated when we implement them, particularly European directives.  I hope that in implementing this, we will not add serious business costs to a sector that is already struggling for its very survival, as is the case with many haulage companies.There is nothing to object to in the conditions which basically amount to relevant housekeeping.  As many Deputies have said, there is no doubt that in this area, HGV drivers in particular tend to give an example to those of us with smaller vehicles.  They also provide an example to public service organisations drivers who can learn from them how to handle large vehicles in an urban context.  On an island nation the haulage sector is absolutely essential for getting our goods to other markets.  It is the basis on which our export trade is beginning to flourish and is leading the country out of its current economic situation.Hauliers are under huge pressure, however, and feel increasingly that there is nowhere for them to turn.  We have a greater preponderance of international operators coming in and using their international might to drive local operators out of the market.  We have a cost regime that, because we are an island nation and also owing to regulation, is much higher than international operators are paying in other jurisdictions.  It now seems that we are proposing to add 2% to fuel costs, in addition to adding to the cost of employees by changing sick pay rules.  In addition, hauliers are utterly frustrated by the bureaucracy they face, and that feeling is shared across Europe.  If these regulations are not properly implemented, the situation may become worse.The introduction of this Bill gives us a chance to reflect on the transformation of road transport and road safety in recent years.  In 2010, there were 212 road deaths, which is 212 too many.  Last Sunday, ceremonies were widely held to remember those who lost their lives on the roads.  We remember all of them.  That figure, however, is a huge decrease in terms of where we were four or five years ago.  The Road Safety Authority team, led by Mr. Noel Brett, and the chairman, Mr. Gay Byrne, deserve tribute for doing a great job in this area.  It is not the easiest job because they are challenging decades of driver behaviour.  In addition, they are challenging a driving culture which did not necessarily put safety first.  It is not that it ignored it, but it did not regard it as an issue.  The RSA has tackled that successfully in the past few years.  In conjunction with local authority road safety officers, they have managed an education programme with robust legislation to change driver behaviour and attitudes in order that safety is now very much on people's agenda.There is no doubt that the improvement in our road stock is another positive addition, although much work remains to be done on that.  The greatest change, however, is in driver behaviour.  People now know that if they break the law by committing a motoring offence they will be caught.  There are no ifs, buts or maybes about this.I heard some criticism earlier of Iarnród Éireann's management of freight, which is an issue I have raised before.  It is not just Iarnród Éireann but the power of the State's transport monopoly and the manner in which it has choked private bus operators in particular.  However, I must also defend Irish Rail.  I am from Ballina which has one of the biggest freight depots in the country, in addition to being the location for the RSA's headquarters.  The Minister visited Ballina during the summer when he saw the freight depot from the RSA offices.  Irish Rail has been able to develop that depot in response to demand from local enterprise and multinationals.  They met that response and have changed routes to bring produce directly into Dublin Port instead of Waterford where it went previously.  They have also offered options to the various operators in Mayo who are now using rail to transport their goods from Ballina to various ports.The issue of cost is an ongoing challenge.  In this instance, however, it shows what can be done when heads are knocked together in the semi-State sector to put them in partnership with the multinational sector to offer a service.  We would all rather that the service was cheaper but there are services there now that were not even envisaged six or seven years ago.  I wish to put that on the record in the context of criticisms that were made.The Minister is committed to bringing in another road transport Bill next year, which is how we will move on and get that figure of 212 road deaths down further.  We must get it into our heads that road safety is a vital issue.  A split second can, literally, change our lives forever in a road accident if we take our eye off the road when driving any type of vehicle.The Minister should examine the situation where somebody breaks the law, thus causing a fatality, by either driving under the influence or speeding.  Such drivers may be arrested and put on remand until their case is heard but in the interim they can drive around without restriction.  It is very difficult for the families of road accident victims to see that happening.  We have strengthened the law and have tightened up regulations, but in the forthcoming legislation we should consider the victims and their families, and how we can give them some legal standing and recognition of the pain they are going through.I agree with Sinn Féin's proposals on the restrictions on prisoners.  There might be an argument to be made for those convicted of serious motoring offences, or even sexual offences, being so restricted.  However, for political prisoners or prisoners on relatively minor offences to be so restricted harks back to a different era.  It also raises the matter of spent convictions.  Legislation is waiting to proceed to Committee Stage and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has promised to bring his version of it to the House.  While there is a debate going on in the House concerning spent convictions for relatively minor offences, it is wrong to continue bringing legislation forward which restricts licences for those who have such convictions.  I certainly agree with the amendment that will be proposed by Sinn Féin tomorrow.I welcome the legislation but regret that it is being rushed.  That is not good and I hope that in this Oireachtas we will learn from past mistakes.  It is only a precursor to what the Minister has indicated will be major legislation for road transport next year.  I hope that in that debate we can challenge ourselves as a State on fatalities and behaviour on roads throughout the country.

I welcome the legislation but agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Calleary, that it is a pity this is being introduced in a rather rushed fashion on the eve of the implementation of the new European Union directive on road transport.  The legislation is rather uncontroversial, with three basic areas of reform proposed.  I am glad the Minister has indicated he will examine road transport in greater detail on a date in the near future.  The proposal to change the criteria by which people will be eligible for licences based on their record is pretty self-explanatory, as is the proposal to increase the accessibility of information with regard to those who hold licences.  The increase in penalties is also appropriate.It is a difficult time for those who are involved in road transport because of the cost of the business and regulation being imposed.  It is not an easy time to be in the business, no more than it is to work in other sectors now.  I agree with Deputy Calleary and join him in welcoming the reduced number of serious accidents and road fatalities in the past 12 months.  That is largely down to improved driver behaviour and it may also be a result of an improved road network across the country, which is at least one legacy from the Celtic tiger years.I emphasise for the Minister the importance of ongoing funding being provided for local roads projects in a budgetary context.  There have been recent announcements on the capital budget and most of the significant capital expenditure has been completed.  Most of the inter-urban routes are finished and as a result, there is not as much funding for major national capital expenditure.  Nevertheless, it is important to provide funding for local authorities to keep up regional and local county roads which carry a large volume of traffic, including haulage and public transport.  In so far as is possible, that funding should remain in place.There is also the issue of signage on the new motorways.  This is an ongoing saga in many parts of the country and my constituency colleague had a result in the provision of signage for Carlow town on the local bypass.  There is ongoing saga on the edge of Waterford city, where I live, regarding some of the signage provided when that bypass and the M9 was completed.  It seems to be very difficult to get co-operation from the National Roads Authority on the signage to be put in place.  Nobody wants a proliferation of advertising signage on motorways but directional signage would seem to be essential, as it is grossly inadequate in many parts of the country.  I ask that funding for that area be protected in the upcoming budget and that there might be some more co-operation by the National Roads Authority with local communities seeking access to villages to be signalled on the new motorway network.The testing of commercial vehicles, such as lorries and buses, is also an issue.  There is an existing network of privately operated testing centres throughout the country, with a review of the licensing system under which they operate having been completed.  Proposals have been drawn up and the owners of these facilities will have to apply to provide the service.  Up to now, the granting of the licence was, in effect, open-ended, but it will now be renewed every ten years.  Does the Minister have any information on how that will develop in the course of the next few months, as the new practice has not come into effect?It is important to continue funding for local authorities in order to provide signage on local and regional roads.  I welcome this legislation and I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak.  Will the Minister come back on some of the points raised?
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Transport Bill 2011.  This Bill not only supports the previous legislation but also enhances it with three new additional provisions.  It is these new stronger measures, allied to the maintenance of selected previous provisions, that I feel make this excellent legislation.A strong and competitive road transport sector is important for the economy, and the road transport legislation has to support that by setting standards, influencing positive and responsible behaviour and eliminating financial gain from non-compliance by setting effective deterrents.  In these times of economic challenge, there is a greater need than ever to reward compliance and set both strong deterrents and even stronger penalties for those who wish to disregard regulations.  The people concerned who decide on their own to act outside the confines of the law are undermining the recovery and efforts of this country to regain its rightful competitive position.Road transport is very important to the economy, both in terms of the movement of goods and people as well as being a significant employer.  High standards in the sector and the good reputation that goes with them are important for our economic competitiveness.  It is important that the public has the assurance that the operators it engages are licensed, safe, reliable, and amenable to the law.  It is also very important for legitimate operators that they are not undermined by those operating either without licences or without complying with the licence standards, including safety on the roads.The first of the three new provisions relates to strengthening the criteria of good repute for applicants and holders of licences, particularly taking into account serious and violent convictions.  The fitness and suitability of operators is one of the key criteria for obtaining and holding a licence.  For example, if an applicant were to have a record which contained certain convictions or penalties relating to road safety, breaking health and safety legislation or smuggling, this would raise questions about good repute in a road transport business and potentially give grounds for refusing an application or withdrawing a licence.  It is hard to see how this would not be of benefit to the process.  Any convictions relating to a range of serious and violent offences such as murder, human trafficking, firearms offences and drug trafficking also have a direct bearing on good repute.  It applies whether the offences were committed in Ireland or in another jurisdiction, and failure to provide this information in an application will be an offence.  As a result, this legislation has an inclusive element and will ensure greater transparency and co-operation among European states.The second addition relates to the greater accessibility of information in the national register of licensed operators by enabling details to be published on the Department's website.  Currently this information is available for public inspection but is not published online.  By publishing it online, accessing the information will be easier and the public will more easily identify if a particular operator, large or small, is currently licensed and if the vehicles being used are authorised on the licence.  This could also mobilise the public to assist An Garda Síochána, which enforces road transport legislation.The last aspect deals with significantly increased deterrents.  It increases the penalties for unlicensed operators and provides for new offences relating to the use of a vehicle not authorised on a licence, forging or altering licence documents, and claiming to be a licensed operator when that is not the case.  For example, the current maximum penalty for operating without a haulage licence is €6,350, with no prison sentence.  This penalty dates back 25 years and it is proposed in the Bill to increase the maximum fine to €500,000 and-or a prison term of three years.  Another provision will make operating a vehicle not authorised on an operator's licence subject to a fine of up to €500,000.  These and other provisions will send a clear message of support to those operators who are compliant with the law and legally licensed, and will represent a significant deterrent to unlicensed operators and those who flout the law.As with all good legislation, those who are compliant with the law and have nothing to hide should not be fearful.  However, those who chose to disregard the institutions and laws of the State should and will have a lot to fear from the Bill.  I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the legislation.  The Bill is technical and while the changes are few in number, it is nonetheless important.  As previous speakers indicated, it gives us an opportunity to bring the road haulage business and private bus operators into focus.  The two previous speakers referred to some of the difficulties experienced by hauliers.  There is no doubt that we are living in completely different times.  Most haulage businesses are family owned and, in some instances, sole traders who are also trying to look after a family.  We must be cognisant of the burden we are placing on road hauliers in terms of increased levies or further regulation.  We must also be mindful of the cost implications and the bureaucratic burden already imposed on the industry.When one considers the ability to transport goods within the jurisdiction and in and out of the country, we are totally dependent on the road haulage industry.  A very small amount of freight is transferred by rail.  We are, therefore, totally dependent on hauliers.  There is an opportunity to engage with them in a much more constructive manner and to listen to their concerns because there is no doubt that the economy is totally dependent on their being able to function.  Similarly, there is a need to engage with private bus operators who consider a considerable burden is being placed on them from the public transport perspective.  In rural areas such as the constituency I represent there is no public transport other than along the main arterial routes.  The public transport provided is provided by rural bus and private bus operators who do school runs and bring pensioners to local towns to collect their pensions.  There is an opportunity to engage with the people concerned and I urge the Minister to do so.I agree with what Deputy John Paul Phelan said about the previous debate we had in the House on other road traffic legislation which was addressed under three headings, namely, enforcement, engineering and education.  There is no doubt that when it comes to engineering, the rural road network is not in good condition.  I would be the first to say the previous Government deserved credit for building the motorway network.  Deputy John Paul Phelan referred to the appalling state of directional signage on the rural road network.  If one were dropped from outer space into the midlands and asked to find one's way to Newcastlewest, there is no way one would find it because of the lack of adequate road signage.Deputy John Paul Phelan alluded also to the problem of maintaining road margins which represent an added cost for road hauliers and bus operators owing to the colossal wear and tear on lorries and buses.  We depend on the people concerned on an annual basis to ensure the people and goods can move around.  Secondary and tertiary rural roads are shovel-ready projects.  In most cases the problem is that we do not have enough staff in local authorities to maintain roads and open drainage systems.  I receive a significant amount of representations from road hauliers on this issue.  Local authorities and county managers especially should begin to take the matter more seriously.  Significant tax contributions are made by road hauliers on diesel, in VRT and the annual road contribution.The Bill is necessary because it harmonises what is needed from a transfrontier perspective across the European Union in streamlining the regulations from an Irish point of view to make it easier for people with an Irish licence to travel abroad.  I would like to see a simple driver's licence being brought forward much faster and I am aware the Minister has proposals to do this.  When one presents an Irish driver's licence in America, for example, the response is to look at one as if one had about four heads when people see a pink sheet of paper on display.  Such changes will improve the position.I welcome the opportunity to speak, but I urge that the road safety issues I raised, in particular about the quality of roads from an engineering point of view, be taken into consideration.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  The House is aware that it is being introduced to deal with a number of issues which arise as a result of the coming into force on 4 December of EU regulations dealing with road transport operators.I support the provisions contained in the Bill and will take the opportunity to speak on a number of them.  It is worth noting some interesting facts pertaining to road transport.  In 2010 Irish registered goods vehicles transported a total of 126 million tonnes of goods by road.  A total of 1,457 million vehicle kilometres were travelled in the same year.  The average number of goods vehicles surveyed was 84,025.  The fleet size has increased by 31% since 2000.  These goods vehicles completed 11 million loaded journeys in 2010.  That is a sizeable amount of economic activity and operators of transport businesses need to be regulated and licenced.  I welcome the requirements introduced in the legislation in this regard.  We are all aware of the difficulties for many people involved in business in Ireland and the transport business is no exception.  In fact, many would argue that it is even more challenging.  While I would like to highlight the difficulties, I agree with the proposal that transport companies must be licensed and ensure they are run by professionally qualified managers.  When one considers the number of kilometres travelled and the tonnage transported, it is imperative that the management of such businesses is undertaken by competent people.  Matters such as road safety, vehicle safety and roadworthiness, the description of goods, type of goods, the regulation of particular products and security of transport of certain products are the responsibility of the said transport managers which, by any standard, are responsible positions in a company.As has been well documented, illegal drugs are plentiful on the streets of the country, despite the very best efforts of the Garda, customs service officers and the Naval Service which have intercepted large amounts of narcotics at various ports in recent years.  However, it is inevitable that drugs will find their way into the country through the commercial truck and transport network.  I hope this legislation which copperfastens the position of transport managers and the licensing structure will help to ensure rogue transport companies and individual drivers who have in the past engaged in this activity will be scrutinised more closely in the future.Human trafficking has been evident in the country.  Tragically, families have travelled here in containers on the back of trucks returning from central and eastern Europe, and many have either suffocated or almost died because of dehydration.  Rogue transport operators have often collaborated with eastern European gangsters in bringing such persons here in other circumstances we have seen innocent drivers caught who were unaware of their return cargo.I note the Farrelly report of June 2009 which examined the awarding of a transport haulage licence to Mr. Kieran Boylan after it had come to light that Mr. Boylan who had been convicted of a serious criminal offence had been awarded a road transport operator's licence.  The report recommended new regulations be put in place to help to prevent this happening again.  They were introduced in September 2009.  The Bill proposes that the Minister decides if the person who has been convicted of an offence under the stated Acts should be refused a licence or, if already a holder, whether the licence should be withdrawn or suspended.  The Minister must determine if these actions would be a disproportionate response, considering the nature of the offence involved.  The Bill means that all offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, not just those under sections 4 and 5, and the other Acts listed must be notified to the Minister and could impact on the refusal or withdrawal of a licence.  Unlike the current situation, the Bill includes no time limit in respect of when the offences were committed.I also welcome the proposal to publish up-to-date details on the Department's website which will become more accessible to the general public.  Clients and large companies engaging in contracts with transport carriers can instantly check the up-to-date details of these companies before engaging in contracts with them.I take the opportunity to highlight to the House, and the Minister, the difficulties created for many transport operators by the rising price of fuel and, in particular, the proposal to raise the price of fuel through the carbon tax introduced by the last Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  The rise in the international price of fuel, coupled with this increase and the increase in costs that will be passed on to companies which produce goods for either export or the domestic market, will challenge transport companies to stay in business.  We must be aware that with a large dependence on our export companies to create and retain jobs the Government must keep a tight eye on fuel and transport costs.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider some form of rebate on carbon tax for transport companies engaged in the provision of industrial transport to ensure there would be some control on transport costs.  A scheme similar to the VAT rebate scheme should be examined on carbon tax for certain sectors.  I urge the Ministers for Transport and Finance to ask their respective Departments to examine such a proposal before next year's budget.  I ask the Minister to comment on this idea if he has the opportunity to do so.It is worth noting that bus transport companies cannot avail of the VAT rebate which is very frustrating for operators in that business.  If this facility were available, if might reduce the cost of transporting many of our tourists around the country and would reduce the cost of holidays in Ireland for many of our coach tour visitors.It is essential that operators of good repute succeed in the transport business in Ireland.  I am glad the Bill strengthens the position for the people concerned and that penalties for unlicensed operators and non-compliance are being increased.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	391	While the Bill contains many positive measures, I regret the imposition of a guillotine on this debate.  In the case of this Bill, the use of the guillotine will prevent a robust discussion with operators and others who have an interest in the Bill.  Furthermore, insufficient time has been allowed between the debates on Second and Committee Stages for the tabling of amendments.  That is regrettable.  Some Deputies now on the Government benches complained bitterly about this practice when they were in opposition.  This is not the way to do business, although I understand there is a time constraint on the Bill which contains good measures which it is necessary for us to enact within a timeframe.Licensing arrangements have developed in a haphazard manner.  In many cases, it is a mere box-ticking exercise, as opposed to achieving the genuine intent of licensing, which is to ensure the utmost safety.  It is not enough to make provision for the issuing of licences.  We must look at who the licensing authority is, how licensing arrangements will be enforced, whether the authority has the necessary resources and the licensing system can be properly complied with, as opposed to conforming to a paper exercise.  Licensing requirements should not impact unfairly on the trade and should allow for a free operation of trade.An industry servicing the safety and licensing requirements has sprung up and associated fees charged for annual renewals can be high.  Licensing is haphazard.  A driver needs a driving licence and several types of licence, depending on the vehicle being driven.  A driver must have a driving licence, a driver card and a certificate of professional competence, CPC, which is an annual licence.  There can also be specialised licences.  A driver must carry all of these in the vehicle at all times.  When the legislation is being looked at again, a more consolidated arrangement could be put in place, whereby one card would be sufficient.This matter has been on the back burner.  It was known since 2009 that primary legislation would be required to comply with EU regulations, but legislation is being introduced at the eleventh hour.  We must examine why this happens.I would like to have heard from the Road Safety Authority, the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Garda and other interested bodies on how the legislation will work for them in practice.  Much of what we do in many areas does not work in practice, although it is very good in theory.  It does not work because we do not match the academic with the practical and this leads to difficulty in delivery.I do not wish to be too critical of the Bill because there are good things in it, but I am focusing on the areas in which I have concerns.  We have an over-bureaucratic approach to documentation.  Drivers of road haulage and passenger vehicles are required to obtain a certificate of professional competence and pass an annual evaluation in order to keep the certificate.  The examination is not an actual driving test and can be taken over a period over one week.  It must be taken on an annual basis.  It is right that there is ongoing scrutiny of competence.  There are further competency tests for more specialised haulage services, requiring additional certificates.  It would be simpler to require that a driver carry a single document containing all the required information.Some of the tests of competence are carried out by private sector companies.  I do not have a particular problem with this, except that they give different types of certificates.  A garda or someone involved in enforcement has to scrutinise various types of documents and a driver must carry several pieces of paper.  We must examine the practical aspects of this.The Bill places an onus on the operator to present drivers with the required documentation, but it provides no defence for the driver.  The Bill assumes that every driver is a full-time and permanent employee and can challenge his or her employer.  Many drivers work on a casual and seasonal basis.  The Bill places the entire obligation on the driver to challenge the employer.  An employer might decide such a driver is too much trouble and simply say, "You are not needed next week."  When so many are unemployed, we must consider such difficulties.  A driver might be glad to get two or three days work, particularly in a sector which is always under pressure.  I understand road haulage is traditionally one of the riskiest sectors in which to survive.  Will the Minister consider this matter?Due diligence in the mandatory reporting of offences is important, particularly where a driver might have access to vulnerable persons.  Nevertheless, the requirement placed on the driver to supply in writing his or her criminal record, if any, might not work in practice.  Given the casual nature of the business, would it not be better to put emphasis on the operator seeking the information?Will the Minister refer to an inconsistency in the Bill, namely, that the minimum age at which someone can drive a heavy goods vehicle, HGV, is 18 years, whereas the minimum age at which someone can drive a passenger vehicle is 21 years?  A certain level of maturity might be required in the latter case, as the load is more vulnerable, but we must consider whether the same level of maturity is required to drive a HGV in the light of the need to be aware of pedestrians, cyclists and so on.  I do not know why there is a three year difference.  Will the Minister revert to the House on the matter?I welcome the provision allowing the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to prosecute offences.  Anecdotally, there are sizable problems with the enforcement — or lack thereof — of licensing.  I would be the first to say the RSA does great work, as attested to by the decrease in the number of road deaths.  However, the lack of resources means that, at best, only spot tests are possible.  Once drivers become aware of the limitations, enforcement arrangements will be impacted on.  People will take risks if they know there is a chance they will get away with it.  While the traffic corps does good work, the reduction in Garda numbers will impact on the corps and reduce its effectiveness.  We should keep in mind the practical versus academic test of whether a measure can be enforced properly.I encourage the Minister to examine the websites of tour operators.  They offer terrific tours with drivers who, in many cases, are also guides.  Given the itineraries presented on these sites, their drivers could not possibly be taking the rest periods required under the law.  It would take the Minister ten minutes to figure this out in examining their websites.  People are, undoubtedly, being put at risk by this practice.The Minister will retain the power to set the level of fees people must pay for the amendment, duplication, grant or replacement of licences.  Is it intended that the administrative cost of the process will be the only amount charged or will more be charged?  I would not want anything other than the cost of administering licences to be charged.  Given the casual nature of the job, it should always be borne in mind that the cost of going to work is a significant issue.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I welcome the opportunity to have my say on this important Bill, as it deals with an industry at the heart of most Irish businesses.  Road haulage services are used by many involved in agriculture, tourism and so on.  Whatever the sector, almost everyone must use road transport.  That is what makes it so important and the House has an opportunity in this debate to acknowledge the great work being done by road hauliers.The Bill is being introduced to address a number of issues arising from EU regulations dealing with road transport operators.  Due to come into force on 4 December, the regulations will require a number of changes, including to the basis for national implementation.  Some matters previously provided for under national regulations must now be provided for in primary legislation before early December.  In this respect, the Bill seeks to maintain the requirement that transport operators be licensed, provides the basis for charging fees for licences, sets out the appeals provisions where licence applications are refused and details exemptions from the requirement to have a road transport operator licence in certain circumstances.The Bill introduces a number of amendments to existing road transport legislation.  It strengthens the existing provision on the criterion to be of good repute, provides for greater access to information contained in the national register of licensed operators, increases the penalties for unlicensed operators and provides for new offences relating to vehicles not authorised on licences.  It is important to note that the regulations will not apply in certain circumstances, those being, any operators who use vehicles less than 3.5 tonnes in weight, not-for-profit road passenger transport services and road transport operators using vehicles that cannot exceed 40 km/h.Few industries are more important than road haulage.  It is the backbone of Irish businesses, small and large, and has gone through a difficult period in recent years.  We all know of expert drivers who set up their own businesses and did well for many years.  Unfortunately, some of these dedicated and able drivers have gone out of business.  It is to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that I am speaking; therefore, my next suggestion is a little far-fetched.  The people in question run their own businesses.  They might be good drivers and know the mechanics of a truck, but some of them are not the best at business — collecting money, dealing with taxation matters and book-keeping.  The county enterprise boards, CEBs, and other bodies should help them to run their businesses.  I have known young people who, despite wishing to start a business with one or two trucks, were not the best business people.  They were good drivers and knew the roads and where to go, but they did not succeed because they did not have the requisite business skills.  There is an opportunity to help such individuals, as every small operator is necessary if we are to keep the road haulage sector competitive.Many young people are now expert drivers, but they need to be helped with the financing of trucks and assisted with the payment of VAT, as well as at the administrative end of the process.  We must examine this issue in the future, as it is not right to see transport firms getting bigger and bigger.  Those of us who travel the roads see them everyday, but we need smaller operators.  We talk about protecting small businesses, but road hauliers are one of the greatest examples of firms which county enterprise boards could help using the Leader programmes.One of the positive aspects in recent times has been the improved road network which has allowed for a massive increase in the movement of goods between cities, ports and towns across the country.  We can all talk about the new roads built.  The road on which I travel most is the Dublin-Cork road and there is no doubt the movement of trucks and goods between our two major cities is something of which the country can be proud.  People are also proud of other roads.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was under pressure recently because the money was not available for other transport projects in the pipeline, but there was no way around the problem.  In this discussion we should consider some of the towns seeking bypasses.  We should seek a cheaper way of facilitating traffic movement through these towns.  A small amount of money spent to provide car parks, one-way street systems and for various traffic management measures could secure the movement of traffic throughout the country.  I refer to a town such as Tipperary which is a major blockade on the route from Limerick and Waterford.  From 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day there is traffic congestion; traffic tails back for one mile outside the town.  It is an important tourism and business link and I constantly hear industrialists and those interested in investing in the region complain about traffic in the town.  There is potential for the Department and local authorities to collaborate on an interim plan to help towns such as it.  Other Deputies may mention other towns.  Knowing the Minister's record, he will lend an ear to the local authorities with cost-effective plans that would benefit these towns.  There is potential, but local authorities and the NRA must come forward with plans.Road improvements have allowed significant growth in the road haulage industry and passenger transport operations.  I have seen a substantial rise in the number of tour operators visiting places such as the Rock of Cashel and Cahir.  If we are to overcome unemployment difficulties, tourism will make a major impact on all regions.  As Ireland becomes more competitive, more tourists will travel here.  We have a country of which we can be proud, with its good food and beautiful scenery; it has everything tourists want.  There is great potential and we should not do anything to stop it being fulfilled.This leads me to believe the regulations and legislation dealing with this industry have become increasingly important.  I welcome the new emphasis on the role of transport managers who shall be responsible for continuously managing the transport activities of undertakings.  Like all industries, the road haulage sector has faced a severe decline in activity.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I welcome this technical Bill which is also welcomed by the haulage industry.  There will be stiff penalties for unlicensed hauliers, which is to be welcomed because there was frustration in the industry at the fact that only licensed hauliers were compliant  It is a welcome move to see unlicensed hauliers facing stringent penalties.  I acknowledge the Minister's work in this regard.We must also acknowledge the role of hauliers, as we sometimes forget their contribution on the roads.  While we are on a quest for excellence in our jobs, others use their vehicles on the roads for their respective jobs in travelling from A to B.  By contrast, hauliers are the ambassadors and professionals on the roads.  Car salesmen, van drivers and hauliers know how to drive and make a unique contribution to ensuring road safety.  A lorry driver may have years of experience or minimal experience, but he or she will still have the lorry driver skill set.  He or she can anticipate danger every minute he or she is on the road.  Such drivers are watching out for anti-social behaviour, anticipating and witnessing risky behaviour by oncoming vehicles.  I recommend that the Minister sit down with a dozen randomly selected hauliers to ask them what is needed to ensure improved road safety.  The hauliers'  representative groups have a job to do such as lobbying on different issues such as carbon tax, fuel smuggling and fuel laundering.  While the Road Safety Authority is doing good work, with a budget of over €22 million, a tremendous insight and an invaluable source of knowledge can be provided by hauliers who know, anticipate and avoid dangers on the road.  They can drive onto the hard shoulder or anticipate cars overtaking on corners or overtaking lorries on a continuous white line.  They anticipate a danger, but we do not monitor this aspect.  As speed cameras do not anticipate this risky behaviour, we have an invaluable resource in hauliers and it is only right that we should ask these ambassadors of the industry for their opinions.  We all think we know how to drive and everyone who gets behind the wheel thinks he or she is a good driver without comparing himself or herself to those who are good at the job.  Hauliers are an untapped resource that we should examine.I acknowledge the economic role of hauliers.  There is a workforce of 50,000, including technicians and persons working in warehouses.It is time to stamp out the practices of hauliers who wash diesel, smuggle, do not register for licences and undercut legitimate drivers because they create a playing field that is not level for those who are compliant.  I have mentioned the issue of cabotage and acknowledge the Minister is examining it.  I encourage him to examine the British-Irish Council as a vehicle for considering how we can co-operate more closely on an east-west and North-South basis.  The United Kingdom and Ireland have different interpretations of cabotage rules, meaning that Northern Ireland hauliers are considered domestic hauliers in Britain while having full domestic level access to the Irish market.  Irish hauliers, on the other hand, can only carry out three operations in Britain per week.  That might suit long distance hauliers and companies which only work on the basis of making three journeys per week, but it is difficult for hauliers in Border counties who work in the sand and gravel industry and must travel over and back frequently.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to look into this issue.There is room for impediments to be examined on an east-west basis.  If there is anything I can do as co-chairman of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly and in my work with the British Irish Chamber of Commerce to eradicate red tape and make business easier on an east-west basis, I will be glad to do it.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  The amendments are welcome regarding the criterion to be someone of good repute and the national register to create a website of licensed operators.In the business in which I operate I deal with road hauliers on a daily basis.  During the years I have been struck by how hard road hauliers work.  They are committed to their businesses and will provide a service at all costs.  If it means working until the early hours of the morning, they will do it.  They are vital to the economy and as such the model we have of smaller operators must be protected.  It is a competitive industry, but it is also fragile.  Road hauliers have lost out indirectly in the fall-out from the financial meltdown.  The loss of our indigenous industries has hit the haulage industry very hard.  Mallow is a pale shadow of its former self since the loss of the sugar beet industry.  We might have complained about dirty lorries on the roads travelling into Mallow in the winter, but we would gladly take them back today.  They created huge business for everyone who repaired them to the people who sold them to those employed to drive them.The loss of quarry work has been difficult for the industry, but it is still going, as the people concerned are resilient.  It is our job to get back indigenous industries, but we must look at the price of diesel which is a massive cost and making it hard to survive.  The people concerned are defying the laws of gravity by offering lower rates as the price of diesel goes up, but this cannot continue.  I was shocked to hear last night when speaking to a representative of the Whitegate oil refinery that a barrel of oil could be traded 500 times.  The speculative value included in the price of diesel is shocking.  People ask me how diesel and petrol can be the same price at the pumps and say it does not make sense.  There is a speculative element that must be looked at which is crippling all of Europe.  When people speculate in commodities, they should be made to put down money instead of there only being variants which the price may reach.  They should have to put down real money, preferably 10% or 20% of the speculative price.  That would result in real savings throughout Europe, not just in Ireland.The problem is that the reduced rates mean we have older fleets of lorries on the roads and they are costly to maintain.  People are caught because they bought the gear and have to pay the money back and they are being exploited to make runs at a loss.  We should put in place a minimum price for haulage because one cannot operate a system that runs at a loss.  It will cost in the long run.  Young people will not enter the industry and larger operators will push aside smaller operators, which will be to our loss as a state.I compliment the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.  I dealt with it during the year on behalf of a driver who was looking for a licence.  The man in question had dyslexia and the institute was very good in how it dealt with him.  He was a tremendous operator, but his dyslexia was an impediment to him.  We got him his licence and he is doing perfectly well.I welcome the regulation dealing with serious convictions.  We must make sure drivers do not have serious criminal records that might lead to serious incidents further down the road.  The website will attract competition, while allowing us to identify legitimate road hauliers.We have new roads, but the Harvest 2020 report on agriculture calls for milk production to be increased by 100% in County Cork.  Most of the local roads in the county would not be capable of coping with the extra transport.Road hauliers also face banking difficulties.  They must buy diesel and operate overdrafts and be backed by the banks, the same as other small businesses.  While we recognise the difficulties faced by road hauliers, we should promote and help them because they are a very important part of the economy.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Road transport in Ireland is governed by a number of Acts dating back to 1933, as well as by a wide array of national regulations and EU legislation.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is conducting a review of all this legislation with a view to bringing forward an updated and comprehensive road transport Bill to replace the existing Acts and set the direction for road transport policy in the coming years.  It is hoped to do this in 2012.The legislation before the House is largely technical, the reason being that it is required to be enacted by 3 December 2011 owing to the coming into force of new EU regulations for road transport operators on 4 December.  These new regulations are replacing a previous EU directive and because of this some matters previously provided for in national secondary legislation must now be provided for in primary legislation; that is the reason the Bill needs to be in place when the new EU regulations come into force.Licences are required for road transport operations providing road haulage and road passenger transport services for hire and reward.  Vehicles operating as part of the fleet of a business, for example, a fleet of vans for a supermarket, do not require one of these licences.  Road haulage licensing requirements apply to haulage operations in heavy goods vehicles, while road passenger transport licensing requirements apply to vehicles carrying more than eight passengers.  Certain activities are exempt from the requirement to have a licence such as carrying mail, refuse and waste and also transport connected with funeral services.Licences can be provided for national activity only, or for international activities which also include national activities.  The key criteria are that one must be of good repute, good financial standing and have professional competence.  From 4 December establishment in the State will be a formal requirement, although it already applies in practice.Road transport is very important to the economy in terms of the movement of goods and people, as well as being a significant employer.  High standards in the sector and the good reputation that goes with them are important for our economic competitiveness.  It is important that the public have the assurance that the operators they engage are licensed, safe, reliable and amenable to the law.  It is also very important for legitimate operators that they are not undermined by those operating either without licences or without complying with the licence standards, including in terms of safety on the roads.I pay tribute to the Irish Road Haulage Association.  In 2008 I was chairperson of Dublin City Council's transport policy committee when the Dublin Port tunnel was opened and the council's heavy goods vehicle strategy was implemented.  The Irish Road Haulage Association was a member of the policy group.  It co-operated fully with the city council in implementing the heavy goods vehicles strategy which excluded five-axle heavy goods vehicles from the city centre, or from within the canals.  The strategy has contributed to better quality of life in the city in that more road space has been freed up for public transport, other vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.  This has been borne out by the considerable reduction in the number of fatal accidents and injuries since the opening of the port tunnel.  Although the Irish Road Haulage Association had a difficulty with the strategy, it agreed with its implementation.  This must be recognised.I wish to draw attention to a very important aspect of the Bill.  The Bill reintroduces the existing provisions relating to the good repute of applicants and holders of licences, specifically in regard to taking into account serious and violent convictions such as convictions for murder, drug trafficking, etc.  The safety of those who travel on buses is extremely important.  I refer, in particular, to children on school buses.  It is important to women and other vulnerable persons who travel on buses that the driver be of good repute.  The enshrining of this provision in the legislation is to be welcomed.The Bill extends the list of positions within a passenger transport operation to which the criterion in respect of the good repute of applicants applies to include directors, business partners and drivers.  The fitness and suitability of operators is one of the key criteria to be met in obtaining and holding a licence.  I welcome this provision and support the Bill.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I can remember speaking on the original road transport legislation 25 years ago, as I am sure can the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I fear this is a sign of the times.There are couple of points on which I want to comment.  The introduction of regulation to the public transport sector is very important.  We must all recognise this has regularised transport methodology right across Europe.  There are still some glitches, however.It is great that we have been able to make progress in the regulation of transport considering that we have failed to have adequate control and regulation in the fiscal and budgetary area.  If we had such regulation, we would not have found ourselves in the current circumstances.  There is a lesson to be learned from this.This legislation is very important.  The objective is to standardise the rules that apply right across the European Union and ensure customers across the Union can enjoy the same standards.Several speakers referred to fitness to practice.  In recent years, questions were raised about the fitness to practice of certain people involved in the transport of passengers.  Perhaps the Minister will state in his reply the degree to which the proposal in this regard will ensure that, where the public relies on public transport, the regulations will be sufficiently and adequately enforced such there are no breaches.The penalty for a breach in the original legislation was £5,000.  It is now proposed that it be €500,000.  There is a distinct difference, which is understandable given that the magnitude of today's operations is considerably greater than that of 25 years ago.  We need to recognise this.Two speakers referred to speculation in the oil market and the consequent effect on transport.  We hear and are reminded from time to time about how oil prices will increase again.  It is stated this is because the Chinese economy is surging, because somebody has coughed in the United States or because an oil well has been closed somewhere, thus leading to an increase in transport costs.  We must all realise that not too many economies are surging at present.  One can talk about this any way one wants but the reality is that the phenomenon is caused by clever guys, cool dudes, speculating on the oil market.  They have been doing it for a long number of years and they are doing it very effectively at present, thus increasing the cost of transport for those who must rely on it.People in this jurisdiction are quite concerned about people who operate from outside the jurisdiction, especially along the Border counties.  Previous speakers have mentioned this.  There are those in this jurisdiction who register in other European jurisdictions, including adjoining jurisdictions.  This can have an excessive impact on those intent on operating here in terms of competition.Are the records available to indicate the number of breaches of the existing regulations in this jurisdiction and in each other member state?  In order that we might be assured that equality prevails, that there is competition and that like is equated with like, it is important to know the number of breaches recorded in each jurisdiction, the extent to which the rules and regulations were enforced, whether there was a prevailing trend, whether Ireland has been a good adherent to the regulations and how we compare with other jurisdictions.  It is critical to know the statistics at a time when we rely so heavily on the road transport sector to ensure our economy receives an opportunity to survive and revive.  It is critical that we have as much information as possible.We should consider the various offences that prevent one from obtaining a transport licence, apart from fitness to practice breaches.  Other speakers have referred to management skills.  Management skills are very important.  Prior to the introduction of the existing legislation, well-meaning people with good intentions attempting to provide a required service found themselves lacking the required management skills to provide it.  I am reminded of the management skills of those involved in fiscal and budgetary affairs.  For whatever reason, these skills were inadequate, thereby leading half the globe into an economic morass.  I am a great believer in regulations provided everybody recognises and adheres to them.  If they do not, they are waste of time.The legislation refers to convictions for murder, manslaughter, drug trafficking, certain non-fatal offences against the person, human trafficking, certain sexual offences, money-laundering, theft and fraud offences, firearms offences and aiding and abetting in respect of all these offences.  There is a massive list and I hope all the offences have been covered and are recognised right across the European Union.  I hope the regulations are enforced equally strictly and without exception in each member state.Many people in this country and economy depend on transport, as do many of our operators.  We will have to compete with those providing services from outside the jurisdiction to an ever-greater extent and we must realise the latter may have lower costs.  In such circumstances, it is very important that the rules be applied right across the board and that they be equally effective in each jurisdiction.Over recent years, the question could have been raised in quite a number of instances as to whether the people involved in accidents were fit to practice.  I refer to the driving of very heavy vehicles.  The requirement to comply with safety regulations and consider braking distances and the size, weight and power of one's vehicle is much greater when driving a heavy goods vehicle.I seek reassurance that everybody involved, including operators from this jurisdiction travelling throughout Europe, is fully aware of the rules and regulations in place.I note that licences can be refused, correctly so, and I would like to think the same applies in all jurisdictions in the European Union.  In the world of finance, apparently, nothing was enforced.  Regulations were in place in this and other jurisdictions, but they were ignored.  In the interests of public safety and peace of mind of those who travel by road or public transport, I hope the Bill will be recognised and enforced across the board.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I agree entirely with Deputies Durkan and Barry regarding speculation on oil prices.  The issue is relevant to the Bill but governments need to consider it.  At the outset of the financial crisis governments decided it was appropriate to intervene in contracts for difference when speculators bet on share prices in financial institutions.The Bill proposes to reform the regulation of freight and passenger transport in accordance with EU regulations due to come into effect next month.  In doing so, it may provide an opportunity for haulage operators in Ireland to move more freely in our European neighbours' markets.  As previous speakers noted, it involves little by way of legislative or policy change, but it transposes existing regulations into primary legislation in order to ensure uniformity with our European partners.  The introduction of legislation to regulate or licence transport businesses will ultimately improve road safety and the Bill is to be welcomed in that regard.  The Minister has already brought two Road Traffic Bills before the House during the short period he has been in office.While the practical effects of the Bill may be minimal, the strengthening of regulations on road passenger transport is welcome.  This is particularly important in the case of school transport.  Many of us entrust our children's safety to bus operators on a daily basis and it is welcome that safeguards in this area will be brought into line with European guidelines.  The transposition into primary legislation of the requirement for such operators to be licensed and the fact that operating without a licence will be an offence under the law are positive developments.Significantly, the Bill strengthens the existing requirement that applicants for licences be of good repute and character.  Any history of serious or violent offences will be taken into account when decisions are being made in the issuance of licences.  The Bill also extends the number and nature of positions within a road haulage or passenger transport operation to which this provision will apply to include directors, business partners and drivers.The Bill provides for a national register of licence operators to be published on the Minister's website or, rather, the website of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

Rogue operators will face stringent penalties for new offences under the legislation such as the use of unlicensed vehicles, forgery or alteration of licence documents and falsely purporting to be a licensed operator.While this is a technical Bill which provides for legal parity with the vast road haulage and passenger transport network in Europe, its objectives for passenger safety should not be underestimated.  The Minister has indicated that he intends to develop more comprehensive legislation on road transport in the near future.  I look forward to debating such legislation when it comes before the House.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  As speakers made a diverse range of comments, I shall confine my closing remarks to issues pertinent to the Bill.Several Deputies pointed out that the Bill had been published late in the day and that late legislation was not good legislation.  I accept some criticism in this regard and apologise to the House that the Bill has come so late in the day.  It was initially believed the matter could be addressed by secondary legislation or regulations, but it became apparent to the Department only a few weeks ago that primary legislation would be required.  This is good legislation and I have full confidence in the ability of the Dáil and the Seanad to scrutinise it for any errors that may have been made.The regulations will apply directly from 4 December.  The Bill is not required to give effect to the majority of the provisions, but I will shortly be introducing regulations to provide in the normal way for penalties for non-compliance with EU regulations.  In finalising the national regulations we received legal advice that a small number of issues required primary legislation, hence the need for the Bill.A number of Deputies raised the issue of cabotage, which is worthy of debate in its own right.  My general view is that the current system of cabotage across the European Union is daft.  I would prefer to see a single European market for haulage, as is the case in aviation with the open skies directive.  Cabotage is specifically covered by EC Regulation 072/2009 and will be complemented by national regulations which will set out offences and clear penalties.  While cabotage is not a matter for this Bill, cabotage offences will attract significant fines under the national regulations.  The levels are being discussed with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure they are proportionate.  The cabotage provisions cannot be changed because they are set out in EU legislation.The application of regulations in any member state is a matter for the state concerned.  I recognise the difficulty in enforcing cabotage offences on out-of-state hauliers if they breach their cabotage entitlements here, and I will revisit the matter in a road transport Bill next year.  I am conscious of the desire of the industry for clarity about cabotage in the United Kingdom.  My Department has engaged in bilateral discussions with the UK authorities with a view to determining whether guidelines can be drawn up for operators.  Members may be interested to learn that the opening up of the entire EU market has been set out as European Commission policy in its transport White Paper No. 2011-22.  I support this objective, but the key issue is enforcement of regulations.  Enforcement is much stronger in the United Kingdom than it is in Ireland.  The UK authorities have powers to impound a vehicle or turn it around but similar powers do not appear to be provided safely in Irish legislation.  This is an issue we may need to address in other legislation next year.A number of Deputies spoke about the difficult business environment, fuel costs and the carbon tax.  As these are matters for the Minister for Finance, I will not comment on them in the context of this debate.  The Bill will not involve additional administrative costs or burdens for operators.The argument for licensing own-account operators is not the same.  It is a very different issue when somebody is essentially carrying their own goods between their own distribution centres and their own retail outlets.  It is very different from a haulier for hire or reward.  However, as vehicle standards and driver and safety issues also apply to the own-account sector, the argument has been made for some kind of registration or permit system.  The RSA has included this question in its recent consultation on commercial vehicle reform and I would be interested in the outcome of that consultation.  As Northern Ireland authorities have recently decided to extend regulations to this sector, we will give consideration to the matter.Deputy Dooley spoke about exemptions.  The additional exemptions he mentioned are already provided for in existing Acts and do not need to be repeated in this legislation.  They are and will continue to be exempted.Sinn Féin Members raised the issue of political prisoners and take the view that offences covered by the Good Friday Agreement that were politically motivated and occurred before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement should be exempted from the Bill.  My impression is that I do not agree with the amendment.  The offences that are specifically mentioned in the Bill include murder, manslaughter, money laundering, smuggling and rape.  I do not know how often murder, manslaughter, money laundering, smuggling and rape are politically motivated.  The principles that follow the Good Friday Agreement are that people guilty of these offences may get early release but those convictions are not expunged.  No amnesty has been provided for those offences.  If something were to happen on those lines, it would need to be a broad Government policy decision to ignore, waive or expunge those offences rather than in this legislation ignore these serious offences just for road transport issues.  Anyone applying for a licence can apply to the District Court and can make a case there as to why the politically motivated murder or rape should still allow him or her to have a licence.  I would be interested to see how such cases might progress.Deputy Ross spoke about Bus Éireann.  Of course Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus each needs a licence.  They are licensed on the same basis as private operators and are enforced in the same way as private operators.  The Deputy should not be surprised if Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus or any public bus company found itself prosecuted by the RSA in coming months.  His comments on Irish Rail were not particularly relevant to this legislation which is road transport legislation and not rail transport legislation.  I know the Deputy has a great interest in the Baker Tilly report.  The offences and corruption uncovered by that report were detected by an internal investigation in Iarnród Éireann.  The organisation is a very different organisation than it was then and now has a new management team, most of whom are not even from this country.  We also have a new management structure with new chairs taking on that role.  If any error occurred regarding the Baker Tilly report, it was that the Minister at the time was not informed about the issue or what was going on.  I have certainly made it abundantly clear to the new chairwoman and chairman that I, as Minister, want to be informed of any such issues and they agreed that should be the case.Deputy Ross also expressed some concerns about the powers being afforded to the Minister in this regard and I have some sympathy with his view.  In most cases now the Minister is not the licensing authority and Ministers do not hand out licences in the way that I do in road transport.  As part of the general review of legislation we might need to consider whether the licensing function should be given to another authority.Several Deputies raised the issue of unlicensed operators and I strongly agree with what they said on the issue.  There are two good things about this legislation.  First, it increases the maximum fine from €6,000, which is not a lot, to €500,000, which is a lot.  Second, for the first time the consignor or customer can be held liable for hiring an operator who is not licensed.The issue of colour coding existing speed limit signs was raised.  We would need to think about that.  Speed limits change over time and it would be a considerable job to change all the road signs on a motorway or road if speed limits were changed.  The solution might be to have more speed signs rather than incorporating a colour code on all the existing directional signs.Deputy John Paul Phelan asked about ongoing investment in local and regional roads.  Obviously the transport budget is very tight with virtually no money for new capital investment.  The priority is maintenance and while we will struggle to do that, we should have enough money in coming years to have the roads maintained at least.  There will also be some improvements in strategic local and regional roads and also national secondary roads in tourist areas, involving removing dangerous bends and so on.  However, these will be very small projects of €500,000 or €1 million with very little above that.  The problem I face is that a large number of interest groups, including local authorities, county managers, Deputies, Senators and councillors, all want me to continue to spend lots of money on planning for projects that we cannot afford to build for perhaps ten or 20 years.  I could do that but if I did so, it would be at the expense of maintenance and removing dangerous bends and so on, which would be a mistake.Responsibility for commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing is being transferred to the Road Safety Authority.  At the moment it is done largely by private sector operators and that will need to be regulated more tightly in future.Deputy Tom Hayes spoke about bypasses.  No new bypasses will be built in the State during the period of the Government, with the exception of Ballaghaderreen, which has now gone to tender, and perhaps something along the A5 route at some point in 2015 or 2016, but that will be it.  More than €1 billion worth of road works are already in the pipeline and we might get started on them in 2017 or 2018, so there is very little point in adding any new projects to that pipeline.  The Deputy made the very good suggestion that in towns, such as Tipperary, which need a bypass, we should try to develop interim plans for traffic management through those towns.  The local authorities who know those towns well should draw up those plans and submit them to my Department or the NRA and we can see what can be done so long as they are genuinely low cost solutions.The issue of the driver certificate of professional competence was raised.  The driver CPC is entirely different from the road transport operator CPC.  The driver CPC from the RSA is required to show that the driver has undergone regular training on how to drive large vehicles.  The road transport operator CPC relates to how to manage a road transport business.  The examination for this is focused on compliance with commercial and transport law and is not connected to driving per se.  A road transport operator CPC is issued following the passing of an examination and lasts for life.

If that were to be made, it would have to be a Government decision rather than one that was particular to this legislation.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I wish to share time with Deputies Clare Daly, Richard Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins.There is no doubt rates have become one of the biggest burdens on small and medium-sized businesses.  God knows the domestic economy has enough problems without the unresolved problem of rates hanging over the heads of businesses.  I will outline a strong example in this regard.  I have an 880 sq. ft. unit in the Italian quarter which I rented at €50 per sq. ft. in 2005 resulting in an annual rent of €40,000.  In 2011, the rent is €25 per sq. ft., which means the annual rent will be €20,000.  Local authority rates in 2005 were €6,073 and they had increased to €6,847 by 2009.  Rates went up by 13% in that period but rent has fallen by half.  The rates to rent ratio is 30%, which is absolute madness.  If one tries to rent a unit for €20,000 annually and the rates cost 30% on top of that, it is almost impossible to rent it.Revaluation is ongoing but it started in 2005 and, seemingly, the officials have still not got out of Dublin.  They still have not revalued Dublin city centre.  The revaluation system is too slow.  More staff are required and there must be a link to market rent, which means a link to reality because that is non-existent currently.  If it is not linked to market rent, a percentage of independently audited turnover should be set to achieve a realistic figure for rent.  The 2009 Commission on Taxation report recommended setting up a transparent nationwide valuation system.  It also recommended a cost effective route of appeal and regular valuations.  Unless a proper system is put in place with the necessary staff, businesses will continue to go out of existence.  That will mean less revenue for the Government, job losses and loss of morale with the economy driven further into the bowels of the earth.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I support the proposal in the motion that commercial rates should factor in the profitability of firms, particularly small and medium-sized firms, as opposed to the current ridiculous system where rateable valuations derive from what a premises would fetch if it was rented.  That is ludicrous.  It is difficult to rent properties at the moment but rates have no link with the activities on a premises.  One wonders why Fianna Fáil did not reform the system in the 14 years it was in power, particularly considering that the final three years of its rule coincided with many serious problems for small businesses and so on.The motion refers to the revaluation exercise being carried out by the Valuation Office, which is a joke.  It began almost a decade ago following the passage of the Valuation Act in 2001.  At the time, at the insistence of the Government, a costly Deloitte & Touche report was done, which grossly underestimated the resources that would be required for the Valuation Office to undertake this massive exercise.  We have to learn lessons from this.  The staff who worked on this pointed this out but they were not properly consulted by senior management or by the consultants.  They correctly anticipated and resisted the efforts to foist such a massive workload on their shoulders and they were involved in industrial action for seven months in 2002 over this issue, which resulted in the provision of some additional staff.  The technical and administrative staff were correct about the debacle that was unfolding but they were not listened to.The revaluation exercise is a joke and it should be abandoned.  I come from a local authority area in which the new system is in place and it has caused chaos.  There is pressure on small businesses but the key lesson to be learned is that those at the coal face know best.  The Government's amendment, which I strenuously oppose, refers to outsourcing the work of the Valuation Office.  This would be a disaster.  We should listen to the people who know best and who told the then Government ten years ago of the problems we are now living with and for which businesses are paying the price.  The current Government should not make the same mistake twice.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I will pass over the irony of the fact that this motion was tabled by Fianna Fáil, given it did nothing about the rates system during its 14 years in power.  Tens of thousands of small businesses are clinging on for survival by their finger nails because of the economic disaster Fianna Fáil inflicted on us and the austerity which it and the new Government continues to inflict.  This is depressing demand in the economy significantly and if that problem is not addressed, there is no hope for small and medium-sized businesses, regardless of how much hand wringing is done or how many words of support for small business we hear from any quarter in the House.The rates system makes no sense in that it does not take into account ability to pay or the profitability of a business.  A differential rates scheme should be put in place similar to that in Scotland.  Another form of this scheme is in place in France where small businesses pay a different rate from big businesses.  It is crazy that a bank branch could be housed in a building with a butcher next door and they both pay the same rate.  The bank branch is highly profitable and linked into a much larger entity.  A differential rates scheme is needed, which relates rates to profitability and ability to pay.  For example, when such a scheme was introduced in Scotland a number of years ago, small businesses and shops were given a discount of between 25% and 100% on rates with a maximum rebate set at stg£4,100.  As a result of the scheme, 60% of small businesses experienced a significant benefit.  That is what I propose to the Government.  One does not have to be a socialist or a revolutionary.  This simple measure exists in Scotland and many other parts of Europe to boost small business.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I lean towards supporting the Sinn Féin amendment.  While recognising the burden placed by rates on struggling small businesses, I cannot endorse a motion calling for the implementation of the local government efficiency review group recommendations.  This review calls for a €500 million cut in local authority funding on top of cuts going back years which have seriously undermined local authority services.  As a former member of Dublin City Council between 2004 and last February, I have first hand experience of these cuts, like other Members who are former councillors.  Parks close early and many services have been cut across the board while central funding has been reduced.  The motion is effectively calling for more cuts.The commercial rates system needs radical reform to take account of profits, total incomes and so on similar to the differential rates scheme in Scotland referred to by my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  This scheme is practical, useful and it keeps small businesses in the economy.  It is a practical measure, which is not radical.  It is ridiculous that a corner shop pays rates on the same basis as a major supermarket chain or a small business on the same basis as a company such as Google.  The solution to the problem of local authority funding is to restore the rate support grant from central government to the level promised when domestic rates were abolished in 1977.  This should be funded from a progressive tax system with wealth, higher incomes and large profits taxed to provide essential public and community services.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I wish to share time with Deputies Ann Phelan, Pat Deering, Robert Dowds, John O'Mahony, Dominic Hannigan, Seán Conlan and Paul Connaughton.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As a member of local government for 18 years, I am conscious of the role rates play in the provision of services.  I am also conscious in the present circumstances of the difficulties many small businesses experience in regard to the rateable valuation approach.  In my area a viable, middle size hotel business had to close down because it could not meet the rates at the time, which was an extreme disappointment to the whole community as it was giving an excellent service.We have called on numerous occasions for re-examination of the whole valuation area.  I agree there should be a nuts and bolts approach to valuations.  We have seen the anomalies, made representations about them and have then seen re-valuation that does not make sense, although we have sometimes appealed successfully.  What we need in this area as well as reform is consistency in how the rateable valuation is applied.  I have experienced quite an amount of inconsistency between similar businesses, which obviously creates a level of uncompetitiveness which is totally unacceptable at any time.The rateable valuation issue has a long history.  When rates were initially removed in 1977, it was a serious blow to local government.  If it is a case of empowering people to make decisions about given services, they should surely be empowered to collect money to provide those services rather than have a third party of whatever type in government to do so.  The move some time back to allocate car tax to local government had some merit, but it failed in the implementation of a good idea.  While anomalies would arise in that regard also, they could have been corrected.We have had various representations in recent times on small businesses.  If a business is in difficulty, there should be a system of appeals in regard to rates, with documentation required, given that we can have "opt out" clauses for many schemes in certain circumstances.  These should be tightly monitored and the criteria should be very tight so there is no room for abuse or inconsistency.  However, when businesses come forward who cannot afford to pay their rates, those rates should either be deferred for a period of years or a level of payment should be made that is flexible to ensure the survival of the business, because that means the survival of jobs.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	415	There is not a small town or business anywhere in Ireland for which the whole issue of commercial rates is not the main topic at present.  The business world is one of the most productive elements in our society and should not be made responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of what is left of local government.  I will not spend much time giving a history lesson.  I know Deputy Boyd Barrett gallantly refused to have a go at Fianna Fáil about this, although I will not follow suit.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 which landed business and enterprise in the unjust position it is in today — that is a reality we should not forget.  Fianna Fáil ruined the most essential public service needed by every man, woman and child in the country.  We must not allow short-term political expediency to be used here ever again.My good friends in the party opposite were also responsible for the most recent "Alice in Wonderland" solution of part-funding local services from development levies during the housing boom.  In the same way that Fianna Fáil mortgaged the whole country to foreign bankers, it also mortgaged local government.  We know that ended in tears and we are all paying the price for it.Local government was primarily set up to assist in the fair and equitable distribution of funds to fund local community needs.  It was the business community that created the noble concept of local government to address its need for public roads, footpaths and lights and to provide homestead comforts.  It is, therefore, ironic that the same business fraternity which set up a funded local services system in the first place is now hard done by.We owe it to the public to underpin the preservation of essential public services by spreading the bill to those who can afford it.  We have to do everything possible in our national Parliament to rescue this precious resource which has so painfully been built up over the centuries.  In this Dáil, we have a clear duty to respond with courage and leadership to ensure that local government can respond when it is needed — during a natural emergency, a fire, water supply interruptions or simply respond to everyday needs that local councils provide 365 days of the year.  We all remember the situation last year.The public have to be wary of those who use the local council system as a stepping stone to becoming TDs and then, when they get into this Chamber, use it to make populist statements to chambers of commerce about a blanket reduction in commercial rates.  This short-term fantasy-land politics is an insult to people's intelligence, especially to those paying the rates, and leads to a very weak local government system.  Now is the time for responsible collective thinking on how we should spread the burden of paying for essential public services by a direct, fair and sustainable system of taxation.  Now is the time when we can genuinely assist the business community, rather than allow it to be used as political fodder, as it is being used in this House tonight.In all of the successful alternatives operated in other countries, there is relief or abatement to those who merit such consideration.  We should be able to recognise fairness.  Surely it is possible for the Valuation Office in a small country like ours to devise a fair, up-to-date valuation of commercial and industrial properties as laid down by statute.  We have to ensure the Valuation Office continues to be independent of sectoral influence and, in turn, does not act for the local authority.  This Private Members' motion has to be challenged because it is a cynical sham by those who continue to be afflicted by selective political amnesia.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Like previous speakers, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The issue of rates affects everybody.  Before we move on, we must assess where the problem began.  Like Deputy Ann Phelan, I was amazed yesterday to hear my constituency colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, trying to remember when the problem began — he thought it was the 1970s.  To remind him, it was 1977 when the big problem began with the removal of rates from ordinary houses, and it has not been addressed since.Amazingly, at that time we transferred the payment of rates to 20% of the ratepayers, which is a serious problem.  After 14 years of Fianna Fáil Government, none of the problems have been addressed.  To listen to the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil Members speaking about rates, one would think this problem only began on 9 March 2011, not 1977.Local authority funding is essential.  Deputy Ann Phelan referred to the conditions last winter and the previous winter when we were all in serious trouble trying to get around in the ice and snow.  Where was our first port of call?  It was the local authority.  If the local authorities are not funded properly, we will not be able to go down that road.  Some 29% of local authority funding comes from ratepayers, which is a large proportion, and the rest comes from a block grant from central Government.Deputy Niall Collins in his speech yesterday lamented the fact that Fianna Fáil had been in Government for 25 years over recent decades.  The local government block grant is also important in the funding of local government which is important in a democracy.  Any discussion on local rates must take place in conjunction with the reform of local government, but nothing has happened in this regard during the past 30 to 40 years.I believe in the concept of sharing services and systems and co-operation between local authorities, which is important.  County Carlow which has a population of approximately 55,000 has three local authorities, Carlow County Council, Carlow Town Council and Bagenalstown Town Council.  This is ridiculous and the issue needs to be addressed shortly.  I commend the Minister for his approach to try to rationalise services for the benefit of all concerned.It is important to understand the more we reduce rates, the more bigger companies benefit, as opposed to smaller companies.  For example, a 1% rate reduction in County Carlow could mean a €5,000 reduction in rates for a big company per year, whereas it might only mean a €50 reduction for a small company, which would be minuscule and of no benefit.  A 1% rate reduction in County Carlow would mean a loss of revenue of €50,000 for Carlow County Council.  Such a loss would equate to the salary saved by the sacking of a member of the outdoor staff in the county council, which staff provide a valuable service for the community.The Minister is on the right road to local government reform and it is important that we continue on that road.  More has happened in the past few months than in the past 25 years.  I have a few ideas that may be of benefit to the Minister when he is considering matters.  There could be sliding scales of rates, whereby bigger companies would pay more and smaller companies would pay less.  We could introduce incentives for ratepayers, whereby a company which took on an employee would receive a rate rebate; such a measure would help to create employment.I compliment the Minister on his reform agenda and wish him the best of luck in the future.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I am pleased to speak to the motion.  As the previous two speakers demonstrated, commercial rates are only one small aspect of a debate that needs to take place on local government reform.  With funds drying up from sources such as development levies which Deputy Ann Phelan mentioned, councils are more dependent on commercial rates, even though there is less money available for services.  The points made by her and Deputy Deering concerning the problems that arose from the decision to abolish rates in 1977, unfortunately, are correct.  Their abolition cut the legs from under local authorities, which was a great pity because the more decisions that can be made at grassroots level, the better for society.  It is important, therefore, that we do our best to introduce reforms.  In looking through the figures for last year I noted that 13 of the county and borough councils had managed to reduce commercial rates to some degree.  While that was probably not enough, it was a start.  The issue needs to be tackled on a broader basis.Another main source of funding is the local government fund which incorporates motor taxation receipts.  When Deputy Howlin was Minister for the Environment in the mid-1990s, he introduced this fund which he ring-fenced for local authorities.  However, all of the money does not necessarily go to the county council which collects it.  There are four county councils in the Dublin metropolitan area. South Dublin County Council, the council for the area in which I live which has a population of about 250,000, receives €24.3 million from the fund.  At the other end of the scale, County Leitrim has a population of 31,000.  However, its county council receives more than €14 million, despite the fact that the county has a much smaller population than the South Dublin County Council area.  Although there are reasons for this, it is important that there be equity.  My county council area which has almost the exact same population as the Fingal County Council areas receives, as I said, €24.3 million from the fund, while Fingal County Council receives almost €30 million.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue to try to come up with a more equitable arrangement.A €100 charge is to be introduced.  It is important that the money raised go directly to the council areas in which the people who will pay it live in order that they will be able to benefit from it.  It is difficult to get even small jobs done in council areas, whether it be the pruning of trees, the jetting of shores on roads which was necessary at the time of the floods in Dublin, or minor repairs to footpaths.Overall, there is a serious point made in the motion, but it is only touching on a major issue, that is, the crying need for major reform of local government.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I am glad to add my voice to the debate on the need to address the commercial rates issue.  Commercial rates are becoming an unbearable burden on small businesses, in particular, as has been stated many times.  I listened to the Minister last night and welcome the efforts he is making to roll out the revaluation programme and reform local government.  It is a little early for this side of the House to be accused of having failed to do many of the things previous Governments put on the long finger or failed to do for many years, but I do not want to get involved in that debate.  I support the view that we need to do something quickly.Bigger businesses and multinationals can absorb costs more easily, unlike the small corner shop or petrol station.  They are the ones we listen to time and again as they employ hundreds of thousands of people.  We have heard in many debates in this Chamber during recent months about how we cannot continue to spend €50 billion when we take in only €31 billion.  Small businesses are in the same position; they are hanging on by their finger tips.  In many small towns in my constituency of Mayo, including Charlestown, Kiltimagh, Swinford and Claremorris, half of the shop units in the centre closed during the past three years.  It is in everybody's interest, therefore, to have a rating system that will encourage people to open businesses in these shop units.  As 100% of nothing is nothing, the issue must be addressed.  A few years ago there were five petrol stations in one of the towns mentioned,  now there is only one.  When the publicans were out marching last week, they told us that one pub per day was being closed throughout the country.  Employment measures have been taken such as reducing the rate of PRSI.  However, it is important to have a sense of balance.  VAT rates were also reduced, as a result of which tourism has been boosted.I agree with many speakers that there is a need for a targeted approach to suit smaller businesses which might employ a few workers because they are not in a position to bulk buy or drive down their costs as much as multinational supermarkets.  These are the business units which need to be given an opportunity; they need to be supported and helped quickly.  Numerous businesses have contacted me, as I am sure they have contacted every other Deputy, about the kite flown on the issue of sick pay.  There are many kites in the air.  The same individuals who are enduring the burden of commercial rates will suffer again by having to pay the first four weeks of sick pay if that measure is introduced.I hope it is a kite and that it will fly away and not appear here in two weeks time.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I welcome the Government amendment to the Private Members' motion.  On a number of occasions over the past six months I have raised the issue of the Valuation Office with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The slow progress being made in revaluing commercial property is a concern for rate payers throughout the country, including in my home county of Meath.  I have received many phone calls and e-mails from local businesses seeking flexibility when it comes to payment of rates.  They wanted to see a revaluation of the rating system.The Valuation Office has not taken on the task with the sense of urgency necessary.  Since it started the revaluation process in 2005 it has examined only Dublin businesses.  The revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area was completed in December 2007, the Fingal County Council area in 2009, and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area last year.  Work on the Dublin City Council area has begun but it is not expected to be completed until 2013 at the earliest.  We can all agree this simply is not quick enough.I have raised this issue directly with the Valuation Office and it stated it does not have the staff to carry out the work any faster.  It also told me businesses in Meath would not be revalued until after 2014 at the earliest.  Businesses in Dublin are getting an advantage while the rest of the country has to wait.  This is not fair and it is not a balanced approach to economic development.This is an important issue for many counties outside of Dublin, including Meath.  More than 90% of businesses in Meath are small and medium enterprises employing fewer than nine people.  More than half of Meath employees are employed by small businesses.  Therefore, rates have a huge impact on the ability of these businesses to do business and grow.In 2010, commercial rates for County Meath accounted for 29% of total annual local authority income.  Commercial rates depend on the annual rate on valuation multiplier.  While this is decreasing throughout the country, in Meath it has increased year on year since 2008.  Therefore, we are keen to see a revaluation and review of the situation.If staffing is an issue I urge the Minister to consider the possibility of redeploying staff from other Departments in the public sector to the Valuation Office.  The speeding up of this process will benefit SMEs throughout the country.  This will have knock-on effects as not only will it be easier for them to do business but we can also expect to see more jobs created.  It would be a move in the right direction.It is about time that Fianna Fáil woke up and saw that the issue of local authority funding is a cause for concern.  It is a pity it took the party too long -until after it left government — to see the problem.  It seems it is waking up only now to the damage it did to this country.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I welcome the Government amendment to the motion.  I have been a commercial ratepayer in the past and I understand the concerns about this issue among the business community given the current economic climate.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies who tabled the original motion made much of the fact that they identified no less than 16 issues, all listed in the original motion, which they wish the Government either to note or act upon.  If it was that simple, they would have done it when they were in government.  It is a pity they did not address the issue over the years.As the Minister, Deputy Hogan, pointed out yesterday, the removal of domestic rates by Fianna Fáil in 1977 was a serious mistake and was done for narrow political reasons.  It left the business community carrying the can for local authority funding.  We need to shape a far more efficient system which, while gathering revenue for local authorities, will be fair to an already under siege business sector and which will protect and encourage job creation.  The revaluation of commercial property has been comprehensively undertaken only in Dublin and I welcome the Minister's proposed legislation to amend the Valuation Act 2001 with a view to streamlining and speeding up the Valuation Office.  I also welcome the Minister's intention to allow the Commissioner for Valuation to pilot the introduction of a new self-assessment valuations process and to outsource valuation work.Higher rates on new start-ups stifle badly needed new business development and do nothing to tackle the issue of vacant commercial premises throughout the country.  A special rate exemption should be introduced to give new businesses every chance of survival in the early stages.As a Deputy for the Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan it would be remiss of me not to refer to the particular problems facing ratepayers in Border areas.  They must contend with the ravages of the current recession and cross-Border competition.  Currency and VAT fluctuations are an annual and weekly problem and have a profound impact on business stability in Border areas.  This is an issue the Government should address once and for all.  I call on the Government to consider providing a rate rebate programme that would benefit businesses which trade domestically in the six Border counties.  This programme could be administered by the county managers and funding could be drawn from a central Exchequer fund to make up for local shortfalls.  Any such measure would do much to bring stability to businesses in Border areas and at the same time inject confidence in a community under considerable strain.  Will the Minister strongly consider piloting the proposed self-assessment rate programme in the Border counties?

This matter is raised on a yearly if not a weekly basis, when considering the issues faced by small businesses throughout the country.  No matter what has happened in the past, it is time to look to the future and see how we will fix this problem and give small businesses the best opportunity to do what they do best, which is to provide employment in local towns.There is unbelievable pressure on businesses at present through increases in costs such as electricity and water.  However, commercial rates continue to pop up as the reason they struggle.  A major issue is with regard to the Valuation Office.  It came before the Committee of Public Accounts several weeks ago and it is unacceptable to have a situation whereby it could take ten years to complete the revaluation process in some parts of the country, given that business changes on a weekly basis.  Many business people are holding on to the idea that the revaluation will be of some assistance to them and might lower their rates.  Unfortunately this may not be the case.  We must encourage a new way of doing this because waiting for the Valuation Office to reach all parts of the country is not acceptable.  It does not have the staff or funding to do it.We have tied the rates businesses pay to local authorities and we do not want to starve local authorities of funding.  Roads are badly underfunded at present, as we can see in all parts of the country, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I are very aware of this through some of the issues we have in our area.  People have been waiting for many years for group water schemes to be upgraded.  They are ready to go, but owing to a reduction in funding to local authorities, they may not see the light of day for a while yet.We must come up at a system that is fair and based on the size of the business involved.  The one-size-fits-all solution is not working at present.  Larger businesses pay the same as smaller businesses and this is completely unfair because on an annual basis local authorities are lobbied to reduce the commercial rate, but all this does is reward larger businesses because they get more out of it.  If we are to continue funding local authorities from commercial rates we must do so on a fair basis.  While small businesses must fund local authorities, this cannot be at the expense of their existence.  At a time when we are trying to create jobs, if every small business had the ability to take on one or two more people, we would start to see a drop in unemployment figures.I welcome what has happened so far in the reform of local government but much more needs to be done.  If we want to see small businesses continue to operate in local towns where they provide employment, we must come up with a more fair and balanced system.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I welcome this opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  I compliment my colleague on bringing it before the House.  It is an extremely important and relevant topic as all local authorities throughout the country are setting their annual commercial rates.  It is one of the biggest issues facing many businesses.  The Government needs to sit up and do something about it very quickly.Just a few months ago the Government hailed the VAT reduction as part of a stimulus to the economy.  However, this week it is stating a 2% increase will not affect our domestic economy.  We are also speaking about small businesses having to cover the sick pay of employees for up to four weeks.  This is on top of the huge burden of commercial rates.  Commercial rates account for almost 28% of all local government finance.  ISME estimates that two out of every five small businesses are in danger of closing due to the burden of commercial rates.  The businesses represented by ISME make up 95% of all businesses in Ireland and employ from one to ten people.  This group estimates that 172,000 jobs could potentially be at risk mainly through commercial rates.In recent months, I have met with numerous small businesses in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath which are seriously struggling to pay their rates.  They have told me that this excessive burden would be the principal reason they may have to downsize or close in the near future.  If it remains unchanged, our present draconian system means that more people will end up on the live register, more families will be struggling and more towns will be decimated.In the current climate we are all agreed that job creation is a priority, but our present system of rates works directly against this goal.  Under the current system, if a business ceases to trade it does not have to pay any of its rates bill.  This has the effect of reducing the number of ratepayers, thus crippling a smaller group of remaining ratepayers.There is also an anomaly in that if somebody wanted to set up a business they would have to clear the unpaid rates on the property in addition to then paying their own rate bills.  Surely the Minister can see that this acts as a direct barrier to new businesses moving into a vacant premises.  I will cite an example where Longford County Council initiated a positive initiative recently whereby it is giving grant assistance to new businesses opening in certain locations in order to incentivise businesses into particular areas of the town where there are many vacant properties.The present system makes no allowances for an inability to pay or a change in economic circumstances.  Given our current economic situation, this seems completely ridiculous.  How long must struggling businesses wait for the Valuations Office to complete its review on the valuation of properties?  Numerous groups representing businesses have requested that a simple "economic conditions" clause should be inserted into the Valuation Act 2001.  This can easily be done and would afford the Government an opportunity to view alternatives.  It would receive support from across the House.  I raised this issue in an Adjournment debate in July.  At the time, the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, said the commission for valuations was actively reviewing options which would facilitate the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe.  The timeframe we are talking about is ten years.Notwithstanding the snail's pace of the review, it is necessary to point out that it is still based on the 2005 rental value of the property.  We all know that rental values have altered drastically since then and even after the review a business struggling to pay its rates bill could still be forced to close.  Last year, the Government's efficiency review identified potential savings of €511 million, which could be used to alleviate pressure on ratepayers.  If even half these measures were implemented the commercial rate bill could fall by 19%.I compliment the many local authorities who are acting on these reviews.  The county manager and his team on my local authority are pursuing an efficiency agenda that is lowering the cost of running that council.I am asking the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to do something quickly, which would have the support of the House, that is, to install the "economic circumstances" appeal clause in the Valuations Act 2001.  That would give an opportunity for us to examine alternatives.  Perhaps we can also examine a self-assessment system and a percentage of turnover.  Under the UK model, a council has powers to exempt struggling businesses and can offer a 50% mandatory exemption for rural businesses.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This House is often accused of being behind in discussing important issues, but we are right on the money on this occasion in that we are dealing with a matter of hugely significant importance.  Given his personal business experience, the Minister of State is well aware of the impact the current financial crisis is having on so many small businesses throughout the country.  I am talking on behalf of the small enterprise sector whose members are not there just to make a profit but to create and sustain jobs.  The biggest crisis bedevilling this country is the lack of employment, the number of people being let go and the number of small businesses going out of operation every day.  That has a consequent impact on employment levels.  At the heart of that problem is a level of bureaucratic red tape and cost for small and micro-enterprises.  I am not talking about SMEs as the European Commission would define them, but those that employ fewer than ten people.  They are absolutely on their knees, as the Minister of State is aware.  He knows the kind of difficulties they are encountering and the impact they are having on owners and their staff.Much noise is regularly made through the media and in this House if some multinational decides to turn its back on this State and leave, or even if a medium-sized employer lets 40, 50 or 60 people go.  However, literally thousands of people are losing their jobs on a daily basis in small and micro-enterprises, but those events never make it into the national media.  Those lost jobs are in shops, pubs, furniture stores and so many other sectors of the domestic economy.  We must do something to protect those jobs and ensure there is a viable domestic economy.  It is not just about giving some kind of holiday from paying such rates; nor is it about forcing Fine Gael and the Labour Party, whose members are in control of many councils, to provide a sizeable rate reduction.  It must be much more fundamental than that.It does not seem fair that a furniture shop, which requires a large amount of space due to the bulky goods it sells, should pay rates on the same square-footage basis as a chip shop, a fast-food joint or some kind of mobile telephony store that is delivering a high-value return on a relatively small floor space.  There must be some correlation between the economic activity of a business and the rates it pays.  Until such time as we deal with that issue, we will never find a solution to this problem.The Minister of State has indicated that there is a different capacity to establish rates and that it would be rolled out if the staff were there.  We hear the usual type of excuses but they are not good enough.  There is no point in saying "You didn't address it when you were in power".  I know the Minister of State will not say that, but others have sought to do so on his behalf.  It is a new situation now.  We are haemorrhaging jobs on a daily basis and will continue to do so unless we can find an appropriate methodology for the collection of rates.I now wish to discuss how rates are spent.  A more aggressive approach is needed to the value-for-money delivery of services by local authorities.  We must have a fundamental review of what local authorities do.  The State does so in terms of the services it delivers, so it is also incumbent on local authorities to do it.  If necessary, they should strip back to the core services that are required.  One cannot expect small businesses to continue to pay for a service delivery that has many components that are nice to have in better times.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I thank my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, for giving us the opportunity to address this unequal system of taxation.  Everybody in the House agrees the current rates model is exactly that.  The business community, in particular the small and medium enterprise sector, is paying the burden of local government while many of those who benefit from its services are not currently making any contribution.  As the local government fund is cut year after year, that burden is getting bigger.  As the service demand on local government increases, it is a burden that will continue to increase unless we act collectively to reform it.I had great hopes when the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, was appointed with responsibility for small business.  He has an interest and a commitment to giving small businesses a break.  However, the headlines and progress to date make a bit of a joke of the Government amendment, which praises its record in promoting and protecting small businesses.  We have a 2% increase in VAT coming up, while we are making business pay for social welfare reform by cutting redundancy rebates from 60% to 30%.  In addition, we are making them responsible for sick pay.  The pension levy has forced many businesses to pay extra contributions for their employees.  It seems the commitment given by Fine Gael and Labour in opposition about upward-only rent reviews has gone the same way as so many other promises, i.e. south.  We need this Government to take small business seriously and not to continue to attack and undermine it, making it pay for the bills of other parts of government.  Every speaker, including the Minister of State, knows the small and medium enterprise sector, particularly the retail sector, is haemorrhaging.  The next four to five weeks will make or break thousands of jobs in this country for hundreds of retailers.  What they do over the coming weeks will decide if they will continue to open their doors, pay taxes and employ people in the second or third week in January.We will see on Tuesday week that the sector is suffering attack after attack on the bottom line, and it is not in a position to pass this to the consumer.  We need reform of the rates system in order to encourage employment and we need new businesses to get a break for the first year.  New ventures should not have to pay the rates until they get up and running and if they maintain or grow employment in the second year, there should still be a reduction on what would normally be paid.  If businesses employ people, those employees will pay taxes and pay their way in society.  Some of those taxes will fund services.We need an "inability to pay" mechanism.  If footfall and retail expenditure is down and banks do not give businesses working capital, they cannot pay a rates bill.  We must define what the rates are for, as many businesses pay rates and money towards waste collection, water charges and other taxes.  What are they getting in return for the rates?  Most local authorities will not even provide a list of the services being paid for but what other bill does a business pay when it gets nothing — not even information — in return?In this House we have struggled for years with the issue.  When we were in Government we kept giving the excuse we now keep getting that the revaluation process is under way.  It has been indicated that it will take many years for this to be finished but small businesses do not have many years.  They have weeks to get the cash to allow them trade into next year.  It is time we gave them a break and took them seriously.  Even if the Minister of State provided reforms in this sector he would have performed a great service for his colleagues in the small and medium enterprise community.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I compliment Deputy Niall Collins on bringing this motion before the House and giving us an opportunity to contribute to the debate on rates, as well as the hardship being imposed on business people now.  Irish Employers for Affordable Rates, an umbrella group, has been arguing for the inclusion of an economic circumstances clause in the Valuation Act 2001.  This organisation was set up in my own county of Wexford and has since expanded across the country.  It has managed to fill halls and hotel function rooms with significant numbers of business people.  These people are not turning out for the sake of it; they are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  They would rather be doing the business they are meant to be doing but, unfortunately, because of the high rates being charged on premises, they are not in a position to meet repayments to local authorities around the country.  For that reason the businesses have come together to put pressure on the Government and other politicians to do something for them.My clinics and those of every Deputy throughout the country are for the first time being visited by business people who in the past have always met their rate repayments but who, because of the downturn in the economy, are no longer in the position to do so.  As a result, many businesses are closing and letting people go, with some workers on three day weeks.  Some businesses have closed completely.  It is the same scenario in towns where footfall and spending is low and business people, shopkeepers and retailers are finding it difficult to survive.Such people are arguing with me and every politician that we must take action.  The revaluation process is ongoing in Dublin and sometimes I wonder why it started in Dublin and will take ten years to get out of the city.  What about the rest of the country?  There are problems for business people in other parts of the country and it is important to speed up the valuation process.  Extra staff should be taken on board and decisions should be made quickly.We know the local government efficiency review group has earmarked €510 million in savings for the sector.  I have long held the view that local government is not performing the way it should.  With the estimates process every year, a county manager will come in acting like a dictator and presenting the estimates for the councillors to go along with.  That will usually happen in two hours or so.  When I was on a county council — I am sure it was the same for the Minister of State — it took the best part of a week or ten days to go through the estimates and make savings and efficiencies.  Whatever the county manager says now is usually agreed by councillors.  It baffles me when a Government must implement an efficiency policy in local authorities.  If efficiencies are to be made, the county manager is being paid a fat salary to make them and they should be done quickly and efficiently.  The savings should be passed on to ratepayers.  My own local authority has been reasonably flexible with business people and allows them to pay over months or a year.  Nevertheless, it is still looking for full payment, which is not acceptable to business people.The time has come for action in the process, which should be speeded up.  The Government must live up to its commitments in the programme for Government and initiate a new rates policy for the betterment of the people.  Deputies have mentioned furniture stores and I visited one recently which has four floors.  The owner expanded the business during the good times, made some good money and paid significant rates.  When he applied for planning permission, the rates evaluation office was notified upon granting of the permission and a lady increased his rates tenfold.  There is currently only one floor of the four floors on the premises operating, and there is no business or employment on the other three floors.  He must pay the full rates on the four floors.  That sums up the problem and we need a rates system based on income rather than the current valuation system.As a business person who has operated for many years, and as somebody who probably understands the position of business people far better than those who are not in business, I ask the Minister of State to take on board the suggestions tonight.  He should make some changes to allow business people to remain in business.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Like others I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the motion.  As a member of Offaly County Council for 18 years I am acutely aware of the value of rates to a local authority.  I am also acutely aware that a county like Offaly has a low rate of large bulk industries and a depends on State agencies such as Bord na Móna, the ESB, Coillte etc., which may be diminished if the Government has its way and puts them into private ownership.  I am sure they will be scaled down greatly from what they are today.  That will leave a diminishing rate base and increase the burden on small businesses and family owned retailers.  They must take the burden of increased local authority expenditure, with lower Government grants in the central local government fund.  The new regime for car tax will also have diminished local authority income.With the property tax being introduced, what system will allow for the reimbursement of funds collected by local authorities?  Will that be confined to counties where the money is collected or will there be a more fair and equitable system to top up the local government fund?As many speakers have noted, the downturn has had a disastrous impact on business and jobs as a result.  We want the Government to commit to an urgent review of local authority rates, with a view to introducing a much fairer and more reasonable system for local businesses.  In recent months we have seen the drop in retail figures, and businesses throughout the country are struggling to cope with inflated costs.  They are under serious pressure to meet such costs.  For many businesses, one of the largest financial burdens is the rates bill.  The valuation lists used for commercial properties hardly resemble current property prices or valuations, which is contributing to the inflated rates.  The system needs a complete overhaul if we are serious about supporting local businesses and allowing them to retain and grow jobs.We call on the Government to look at new systems such as self-assessment based, for example, on turnover.  A new system should take into account the ability of each business to pay and the fact that many businesses are seasonal.  Based on earlier contributions, I am concerned by the extent to which some members of the Government appear to shrug off the issue at a time when so many businesses in my county and many others throughout the country need as much support as possible from the State.Recently, we heard of a 2% increase in VAT and that employers would pay sick leave in future.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government indicated there might be no change to commercial rates.  If small business owners go bust and are forced to close there are no social welfare entitlements for them.  If they have a few children the Government will cut the income from child benefit as well.  That is a huge vote of confidence from a Government that promised jobs budgets, jobs initiatives and 100,000 jobs from NewERA.  Give us a break lads.It is crucial that we give small businesses as much breathing space as we can in order to secure their future and encourage growth and job creation.  This Fianna Fáil proposal only asks for what is fair and seeks to modernise what has become an outdated system that is full of anomalies.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I join with my colleagues in commending our spokesperson, Deputy Niall Collins, on tabling this Private Members' motion which is timely and opportune.  It is of critical importance to many businesses, in particular small and medium businesses that have suffered and struggled so much in recent years and which are doing Trojan work on a day-to-day basis currently in order to stay in business.Unfortunately, the rates system is outdated and has become completely unsuitable given the situation that has faced the country in recent years.  The rates system takes no account whatsoever of a business's ability to pay.  Neither does it take into account the nature of the business or its profitability.  All that is taken into account is the size and value of the premises in which the business is located.  One could have an unprofitable business in a certain building at one time and a business with a high turnover could move into the same premises the following week yet it would only have to pay the same rate.  If one were to apply the way rates are assessed to income tax, whereby someone has to pay a set amount from their income regardless of whether they are earning €1 million a year or €30,000 a year, no one would stand for it, yet that is what we ask businesses across to country to put up with.When I was a member of Donegal County Council I saw the difficulty presented to local authorities.  In recent years the council attempted to introduce a repeated annual reduction in rates of 3%.  At the same time as rate reductions were being introduced people were going out of business with resultant bad debts which meant that the one aspect of local authority income over which the council had control, namely, rates, was being squeezed from every direction and the council was then obliged to cut services in order to make it more affordable for ratepayers.  Such a situation is not acceptable either as it put local authorities as well as businesses in an unenviable position.The new Government was elected by the people at a difficult juncture in our history when the economy and businesses were facing a difficult situation.  I am the first to admit that rates should have been addressed by the previous Government.  The current system has been in place for too long.  The previous Government had much to deal with, given that the international situation and the economic situation were deteriorating by the day.  The new Government put itself forward as a panacea to many of the problems we had.  It was suggested that if one could just change the people at the helm things would be a lot better all of a sudden.There were justifiable hopes that issues such as rates would be addressed.  Instead, no attention was paid to rates in the programme for Government in spite of it being one of the biggest issues facing business in the country.  In place of the promise for 100,000 jobs, we got a jobs initiative which introduced a reduction of 0.5% in the lower rate of VAT.  We were told that would make a massive difference.  What we are seeing in the budget announced in Germany last week is a 2% increase in the rate of VAT from the same Government that told us how crucial the 0.5% reduction in VAT was which it delivered on the back of the general election a few months ago.  Unfortunately, the Government does not appear to be pro-jobs or to be trying to ensure we get back on our feet by ensuring small businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who will deliver those jobs get a fair break.The Government must tackle rates and introduce a system that takes into account people's ability to pay.  In the next three weeks the Government must revise its decision to introduce a 2% increase in VAT.  Being from a Border county I know more than anyone else the impact it will have.  The VAT increase will have a massive impact in Border counties but it will also have a serious impact on all other businesses around the country.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, following tonight's Private Members' motion and in view of the situation that exists across the country, to review the rates as soon as possible.  I also urge him to use everything at his disposal to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the 2% increase in VAT because it will be a nail in the coffin of many businesses with which I have been in contact.  I commend the motion to the House.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I am delighted to contribute to the debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  Deputy Niall Collins and his colleagues have raised important points.  However, the Government is conscious of the 200,000 companies which employ 655,000 that generate €90 billion in the economy.  It is important to recognise that many issues affect business and rates is one of the difficulties.  It is a bottom line issue.The debate has afforded the Government an important opportunity to highlight the steps being taken to assist businesses and to enhance local government in these uncertain economic times.  It is clear that employer and employee confidence is of great importance.  As my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, stated last night, the Government is acutely aware of the pressures on many businesses currently and the challenging economic environment in which many property and business owners are operating.  In the context of retail, we have 13,000 sq. ft. of retail area per head of population compared to 1,000 sq. ft. in the UK.  That expansion occurred during the property boom and has increased the pressure on all those involved in retail currently.The Government is focused on reducing the costs of doing business.  Today, I launched a 12-point plan for small companies, on which I will not elaborate at the moment, but it is a good concept for what we plan to do for small companies.  As it states in the motion, it is important to support competitiveness and employment in the economy in order to promote job creation and the retention of the jobs that currently exist in small companies.  It is also critically important to protect the interests of communities.  The issue relates to confidence and credit.  Rates are one aspect.  We are dealing with the availability of bank funding to small businesses.  The confidence of consumers to spend is also important.  It is the job of Government to ensure that government costs on businesses are reduced.Income from rates is a vital contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities, with 29% of local authority income being raised locally from commercial rates.  The Government is fully committed to assisting local authorities maintain a stable base for funding, while supporting businesses in the uncertain economic environment in which we all operate.Local authority cost bases have been reduced and continue to be rigorously examined to maximise efficiencies which, in turn, impact positively on business.  The value for money audit within local authorities is also important.  We will continue to impress upon local authorities the need for intensive measures to enhance efficiency with a view to minimising rates and charges for business, and a rigorous efficiency drive is being pursued in this context.  I know the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is pushing this aspect.I will outline again some of the key measures taken to date.  Annual rates on valuation have been reduced by an average of 0.6% in 2010 and by a similar level in 2011, involving real reductions in local authority income from rates.  The Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State which will assist in providing a more equitable distribution of rates across those liable to pay rates.  The timescale of this review is of concern and should be shortened.  A significant amount of work has already been undertaken on a Bill amending the Valuation Act, which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform hopes to bring to Government shortly.  General purpose grants of €790 million have been allocated to local authorities in 2011, which have assisted in reducing the overall burden that would have otherwise been placed on commercial ratepayers.  The burden of commercial rates falls on a very narrow group of people.  An implementation group with an independent chair and business expertise has been established to drive and oversee implementation of the recommendations of the report of the local government efficiency review group.  Business support units in each county and city council are providing a focal point for businesses.  We intend to develop and centralise business supports in every county.  There will be an announcement on that shortly.  The support groups will engage with the local government system and smooth their path in setting up and managing their businesses.My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to keep all matters relating to rates, local government funding and reform under regular consideration.  Inadequately funded local services are not in the interest of business nor do they support those who would look to invest in Ireland.  The Government wishes to ensure that local authorities continue to provide the required economic planning and development, and underpin the provision of goods and services, as well as community infrastructure to serve their communities.  The Government is committed to making our economy more competitive and remains fully focused on job creation and maintaining the existing 655,000 jobs in small companies.The local government sector has an important role to play in this regard.  Local services are vital.  I understand what Deputies are saying about the stacked up costs of establishing and running a business.  We are determined that every avenue will be pursued to support business and to optimise efficiency and curtail costs in the local government sector.This is an important motion and this is an emotive issue for every business here.  This is one of the many difficulties experienced by small businesses at present.  The Government is seriously looking at this issue.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I welcome the motion and congratulate Deputy Niall Collins on bringing it forward.Rates bills are contributing to the closure of businesses throughout the country, leading to job losses.  I have met various lobby groups recently who have given their perspective on these issues.  The Licensed Vintners Association asked when a new Valuation Bill would come before the Dáil and would it include a measure to allow for an immediate appeal of rateable valuation based on a change of economic circumstances.  At present, a premises can be re-rated only if there is a physical change in the premises.  They gave the example of a public house, 80% of whose business is food, being by-passed by a new road and losing 80% of its business.  This is not a material change in circumstances under current valuation law and the premises' rates will stay unchanged even though the business has been decimated.The Restaurants Association of Ireland feel the present rating system is unfair and is contributing to job losses and business closures.  Restaurateurs want permission to lodge an appeal on the basis of changed economic circumstances and inability to pay.  They also want a comprehensive review of the present rates system with the aim of funding local government on a more equitable and sustainable basis.  This is likely to involve the setting up of a representative review group to examine the rates system in detail, consult with all interested parties and recommend the best alternative.  They mentioned the local government efficiency review group, which has identified savings of €511 million to be achieved.  This is mentioned in our motion.  If even half of the €511 million suggested by the group were passed back to business the total commercial rates bill could fall by almost 19%.These lobby groups made clear and serious points.  Commercial rates provide almost 30% of local government finance.  This is being realised from a small and hard-pressed base.  That base will be further reduced if we continue with this system.  In County Galway, for example, €2.7 million of rates was written off in 2009 and in Galway city €2.4 million was written off in the same year.  These figures have, no doubt, increased since then and will continue to do so.What is true for publicans and restaurateurs is true for all businesses, particularly small and medium size enterprises.  Members of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, with which the Minister of State was associated, say that 40% of small and medium size enterprises are under threat from the burden of commercial rates and ISME members are making a major contribution to the national finances.  Chambers Ireland and RGDATA have consistently criticised local authority charges which hit businesses that are already struggling in the wake of the international downturn.  The Irish Hotels Federation has been lobbying on the negative impact of rates on its industry.  The federation called for the scrapping of the 2001 Valuation Act and made the point that rates fund 90% of local authority finances.Those issues, plus the slow rate of revaluation by the Valuation Office, are major issues for the people.  The fact that an overall review of rates in all local authorities might take ten years is very worrying.  We cannot have Irish businesses struggling for survival in these very difficult economic circumstances with the rates regime on top of them.  As many business owners have said, rents are falling but rates are increasing.  At a briefing session today, the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland said turnover had dropped 28% in four years while rates are still increasing.I ask the Minister to look at the situation in the United Kingdom, for example, where economic conditions and ability to pay are taken into account when rateable valuations are assessed.  Councils there have the power to give exemptions from paying rates and money collected is put into a central pot and distributed to councils on the basis of need.  I ask the Minister of State to support the motion and to take this opportunity to take real action to help small businesses which are in very serious difficulties.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I am glad to have this opportunity to utter a few brief sentences on this matter.  I commend my party colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, for bringing forward this motion, which is timely and important.In recent weeks and months Members of this House have been talking about the relative buoyancy of the export sector in Ireland and the flatness in the domestic economy.  That is what this debate is about.  It is about the businesses whose statistics the Minister of State quoted a moment ago.  Those figures graphically illustrated the employment potential in the domestic economy where the businesses which are paying commercial rates to the various local authorities play such a vital role.   The reality is that high business costs equate with reduced employment opportunities or a combination of premium loading on business products.  We need to establish a planned and systematic approach to revitalising the sector.  An examination of commercial rates will be an integral part of that process.  If the Government is willing to establish a clear policy position, there will be opportunities for job creation.  Given that nearly 500,000 people are unemployed, addressing this issue is urgent.In recent weeks, the suggestion that the rate of VAT will increase by 2% has sent a shudder through the business sector of my constituency of Louth.  One can only imagine the increase's impact on the range of businesses in County Louth and the north east as a whole.  I remember the vision of cars streaming northwards in tailbacks lasting miles and waiting to get into supermarkets in Newry and further afield in the North.  Not for a moment am I denigrating those who travelled North, but the trading equilibrium will clearly be affected if the suggested provision is implemented.  Combined with this is our position on rates, whereby the valuation system is inflexible and does not take account of the challenges that face businesses from time to time.  We need to consider the UK model, in which economic circumstances can be factored into the calculation and businesses can be tided over during difficult economic periods.I am happy to have had an opportunity to contribute to this debate and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who knows much about the business sector, will take account of the valid and constructive points made by the Opposition and convey them to the Minister and the Department with direct responsibility for this matter.

Ar ndóigh, tá costas maireachtála i bhfad níos airde ar na hoileáin ná mar atá ar an mhórthír.  Ní hé an costas iompair amháin atá i gceist.  Bíonn daoine ag caint faoin gcostas iompair, ach go minic ar oileán séard a chaitheas duine a dhéanamh ná an t-ábhar a thabhairt chomh fada leis an gcé, íoc as an iompar agus duine eile a íoc as an rud a thabhairt ón gcé chuig an teach.  Cuireann sin go mór le costais gnó a reachtáil ar na hoileáin.  Fadhb eile ar na hoileáin ná go mbíonn séasúr gearr orthu.  Séard atá muid ag moladh ná go mbeadh leath ráta le híoc ar na hoileáin.

Cuirfeadh seo borradh faoi na hoileáin.Is cuimhin liom nuair a d'fhoilsigh mé polasaí i 1997 do na hoileáin go ndúirt Pól Ó Foighil, ball d'Fhine Gael ag an am, dá gcuirfinn leath den pholasaí sin i gcrích go gcuirfinn athrú an-mhór ar na hoileáin.  Caithfidh mé a rá gur admhaigh Pól Ó Foighil i bhfad ina dhiaidh sin go ndearna mé i bhfad níos mó ná leath den pholasaí sin a chur i gcrích.  Tá deis ag Fine Gael anois, i gcuimhne ar Phól Ó Foighil más maith leo, rud éigin fiúntach a dhéanamh do na hoileáin.

Níl aon rud a chosnaíonn níos mó ar an Stát ná áit atá ag fáil bháis, áit go gcaithfear na bun seirbhísí a choinneáil ag imeacht ach nach bhfuil aon phobal ann.Mar sin, táim ag impí ar an Aire breathnú ar an gcéim an-bheag seo a bhféadfaí a thógáil agus nach gcuirfeadh as do thada agus a dhéanfadh cinnte de go mairfeadh agus go bhfásfadh gnóthaí ar na hoileáin.The Government came in on a promise of jobs.  That the jobs budget became a jobs initiative was a fiasco.  We are now being threatened with a 2% increase in the rate of VAT and told that every employer will need to pay the first four weeks of employees' sick leave.  Regrettably, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government does not seem to understand the urgency attached to the matter under debate.Rates are a small issue for several large payers of rates, namely, the large manufacturers and utilities that, in some cases, account for 80% of the rates base.  The rate is a fraction of a percentage of their cost base and is not a serious issue for them.  The reduction in rates for such businesses would not make a significant difference to their viability.The problem arises for small businesses, for example, retailers and those in the hospitality industry, in respect of which the rates are proportionately a greater percentage of their overheads.  In many cases, such businesses do not represent a large portion of a council's rates revenue.  Through a nuanced approach that targeted these industries, including town centre businesses that are closing down, one could do a great deal for little money.  If we want to regrow the economy, there must be win-win situations and cutbacks should not be the only show in town.  If we stimulate ratepayers, we can increase business while preventing local authorities from losing revenue.The solutions offered in the Government's amendment are a long way down the line and will take a long time to implement.  In the seanfhocal, the Government is telling small businesses and the hospitality sector, "Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhaidh tú féar", that is, "Live, horse, and you will get grass".  In many cases, the horse will be dead by the time the grass grows.  We need an incisive, targeted approach that focuses on those broad types of businesses for which rates constitute significant overheads.We need to treat this issue as a matter of urgency.  The last thing we need is procrastination.  We need action and a vision so that we might give businesses a start.  We cannot add to the inhibitions that prevent businesses from growing.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his officials should agree to engage with the all-party committee that deals with this issue.  We should not say after tonight that, simply because we have put our point and the Government has answered, it is the end of the job as if the problem will not continue for people who wake up tomorrow morning and find that they cannot pay their rates.  The committee should examine a targeted method through which to assist those for whom rates are an impossible burden.  We should do this in the spirit of reform to which the Government referred, given its comments on the relevancy of the Oireachtas.  Every Deputy is equal, in that we have all been elected by the people.  Is the Government willing to invest the hours and effort, to listen to every idea and to act to resolve the issue?  Regrettably, this does not appear to be the way the Dáil is working and the Government seems to be issuing diktats.  Maybe my plea will not fall on deaf ears and the Government will listen and work with every Deputy to find a solution to this urgent and pressing problem.

Credits may be awarded for periods when an insured person is receiving one of a range of benefits or allowances, including jobseeker's benefit or allowance, illness benefit, disability allowance, or carer's benefit or allowance.If a person is unemployed and does not qualify for a jobseeker's payment, he/she may qualify to sign on for credits at his/her local social welfare office to maintain the insurance record and preserve future social welfare entitlements.  In addition, people who apply for Illness Benefit but do not qualify for payment, may be entitled to credited contributions.  In these circumstances, when a customer is disallowed a payment, he/she is advised of the entitlement to claim credits.  The full range of social insurance credits available, and the circumstances in which these credits are awarded, are included in the SW12 booklet, published by the Department.   This information is also available on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.The Department's policy is to ensure that all customers are made aware of the wide range of schemes and services available, including the availability of credited contributions, and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur. The Department operates a network of local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each local office has officers who provide information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  These locally-based services are supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.

The purpose of the Redundancy Payments Scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2007, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of €600 per week.Statutory redundancy lump sums are generally paid by the employer who is then entitled to a rebate from the State of 60% of the relevant amount.  In cases of employer default, the statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement is paid in full to the employee.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).I do not accept that any reduction in the size of the redundancy rebate would necessarily reduce the size of redundancy payments made to workers.  Many employers are anxious to ensure that their former employees are adequately compensated in the event of redundancy and pay their former employees in excess of the statutory minimum.  It should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions. In the UK for example, the redundancy payment is funded 100% by the employer and there is no recovery from the State.Any changes to the redundancy payments scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The National Employment and Entitlements Service as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.In line with good international practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation.  The objective of the new service is to offer users a high level, personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage actively with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.As part of the development of this overall approach, reduced rates were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010 to ensure compliance with the activation processes.  Basically, there is a right to a payment but also a matching responsibility on the unemployed person to engage with the system.  This, I think, is a reasonable approach from the individual's and the taxpayer's perspective.  The reduced rates, which apply to personal jobseekers payments, may be implemented where a jobseeker:(i)    refuses an appropriate offer of training by an officer of my Department;(ii)  refuses, or declines to avail of, an offer of training from FÁS;(iii)  declines an intervention under the NEAP;(iv)  does not attend NEAP meetings with a FÁS officer;(v) drops out of the NEAP process.The relevant legislation provides safeguards for the social welfare recipient in terms of the reasonableness of the intervention being offered. In common with many social welfare provisions, the new measures allow for discretion on the part of a deciding officer, as an offer of training, education or employment must be viewed in the context of a person's circumstances.  Where a customer has been subject to the reduced rate, the normal rate of payment will be restored from a current date when the person subsequently engages with the process or takes up offers of training that were made.Any changes to the measures currently in place, the introduction of further measures, and any associated savings and timeframes, would be matters for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. Those who qualify are normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.    The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be ‘exceptional'. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice. Every decision is based on the careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.In general, it is not considered appropriate that exceptional needs payments should be made towards the costs of furnishing private rented accommodation. In this regard, my Department will, as the Deputy suggests, be raising this matter with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	437	The phased introduction of the Public Services Card started last month.  The registration process is currently being piloted in a number of local offices in the Department, including Tullamore, Sligo and Kings Inn in Dublin.  Roll out of the card will be done as securely and speedily as possible but it will take a number of years to complete. The initial focus will be on roll out to Department's clients of working age.   The benefits of adopting the Card in the public sector can be found in the following areas:Removing the duplication caused by multiple agencies each solving the problem of identity and authentication themselves;Reducing the rate of errors and fraud caused by incorrectly identified and authenticated citizens;Replacing other State cards currently in use thus producing economies of scale as well as eliminating losses due to, for example, forgery;Improving the efficiency of every service delivered by the State.   Even an improvement of a few percentage points represents major cost savings.Given that customers have regular interaction with various State service providers, the existence of the PSC has obvious similar potential savings benefits across the State sector through the reduction of time and effort required for authentication. Specifically in relation to the Department of Social Protection currently, each time  customers apply for a service, they are required to provide identification details either by post or in person. The time taken in checking and processing these authentication details  would be eliminated if the customers involved had previously reached the required registration standard and had the PSC to prove it.In the context of welfare fraud the comprehensive roll out of the card would significantly reduce the risks associated with both non-residency and multiple claiming.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held. An applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study to qualify for BTEA. This requirement has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  The allowance essentially replaces a person's existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.A person signing for credits for the required length of time is eligible to participate in the scheme provided the relevant qualifying conditions for BTEA are satisfied. Persons signing for credits do not receive a weekly payment but they can avail of the cost of education allowance. This is a once off payment of €500 at the start of each academic year.The person concerned was paid his full entitlement of jobseeker's benefit for 234 days to 11 February 2011. His subsequent application for jobseeker's allowance was disallowed because his means derived from parental income are in excess of the scheduled limit. He claimed for credited contributions only from 14 February 2011.He applied for back to education allowance on 13 July 2011. On 15 August 2011, a letter was sent informing him that his BTEA application had been approved on the basis of his credited contribution claim and he was entitled to the cost of education allowance payment of €500 on production of the relevant documentation from the Registrar's office of the college he is attending. A letter of reminder was sent on 24 October 2011 but to date no response has been received.  There are no plans, at present, to modify the existing qualifying criteria for the BTEA scheme for people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment at the commencement of a course of education.

For the purposes of one parent family payment, there is no entitlement where earnings exceed a threshold of €425 gross per week.  Where earnings are less than €425, the first €146.50 is disregarded and half of the balance is assessed as means.  The rate of payment is then reduced accordingly.  However, where a person has income from employment by the Health Service Executive (HSE), or by a person approved by the HSE, as a home help, all such earnings are disregarded.  In order to avoid any misinterpretation of the conditions of income as a home help, the guidelines for the scheme will shortly be updated and all relevant staff informed.

There are a number of possible social welfare payments for which a customer may qualify thereafter, depending on their circumstances. Currently, letters are sent to illness benefit customers 13 weeks before their claim is due to expire. The customer is advised about other possible schemes for which they may qualify, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. Customers are also advised that if they are considering applying for any of the schemes they should do so as soon as possible so that a decision on their application can be made in a timely manner. Furthermore, in order to expedite matters, where a customer has had a recent medical review under the illness benefit scheme this review is used to assess medical suitability for other schemes where possible.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	441	In cases where a jobseeker customer takes up temporary work for periods of up to 4 weeks, or avails of a training course of up to 8 weeks, arrangements are in place to temporarily suspend the claim so that it can be re-instated without delay when the work or training finishes.   When a customer receives an offer of employment which is expected to last no more than four weeks, they should tell their social welfare local office that they will be working for a short period only.  It is necessary for the customer to state that the work is expected to last for a maximum of four weeks or that the training will last no more than eight weeks.  Customers are informed of these arrangements when making a jobseeker's claim and this information is also available on the Department's website.  This procedure is in operation across the full range of the Department's network of local and branch offices.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers and works to ensure that claims are processed in the most efficient way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme and to ensure, insofar as is possible, that funding is targeted at those most in need.     Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  For example means assessments are required for social assistance schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  Medical assessment is required for long-term illness schemes.  In the case of some insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.In managing these issues the Department has also had to adapt to a large increase in the volume of claims as economic conditions deteriorated and the scope of schemes was expanded. In order to meet this challenge, the department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the deployment of new computer systems. New systems have been deployed this year to manage the processing of invalidity pensions and carers' allowance claims and are currently being deployed to modernise the processing of disability allowance claims. This deployment of new systems is a very resource intensive task and has, as a consequence, had a negative impact during the development and deployment phase on processing performance. Once the programme of deployment is completed I expect that  performance will recover and improve. In the meantime the Department is taking all steps available to it to augment resources in order to process claims.For example, since May 2008, 794 staff have been assigned to the Department, mainly through the transfer and redeployment of staff from other Government departments.   In addition, the Department has recruited new medical assessors and appointed additional staff to the social welfare appeals office. The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.In order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is also undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  The establishment of the NEES under the management of my Department involves bringing together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of FÁS, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the Dept of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency Schemes from the Dept of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.It is my intention that the NEES will integrate all  employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit.  This new service will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to customers and will help minimise the duplication that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.With regard to the issue of contradictory opinions relating to the assessment of application for various schemes, I take it that the Deputy is referring in particular to medical assessment of claimant conditions.  In this regard, the Department's Medical Assessors are fully qualified and experienced practitioners who provide a second opinion to that of the person's own doctor for the guidance of deciding officers.  In carrying out assessments the Medical Assessor considers all medical evidence presented and expresses an opinion based on findings.  All assessments are carried out in accordance with the accepted guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons called for assessment are fully safeguarded.If a decision, based on the opinion of a Medical Advisor, is unfavourable to a customer, the customer has a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. Before an appeal is heard by an Appeals Officer, the customer is afforded a second medical assessment by a different Medical Assessor to the one who gave the original unfavourable opinion.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 33, 36, 42 and 43 together.JobBridge, the national internship scheme, came into operation on 1st July.  JobBridge provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The first internships commenced in mid-July and, as of Friday 18th November, a total of 2,712 internships have commenced.  As JobBridge internships are for either 6 or 9 months it is too early to determine the number of interns who have attained full employment as a result of their internship.Earlier this month my Department issued a request for tenders to evaluate the JobBridge scheme. Progression rates from JobBridge into employment will feature as part of this evaluation.  It is expected that this evaluation will commence in early 2012.As I outlined in mid-October, the JobBridge scheme has a number of measures to prevent the abuse of the scheme by employers, protect the intern from exploitation and ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme.  In order for all applications from host organisations to be approved they must meet a number of criteria to ensure that the potential internships are of sufficient quality.  These include the following:that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;that the internship is not displacing an employee; andthat the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.In order for an internship to commence a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.  At the end of an internship, host organisations must supply the intern with a reference which includes a statement of all training undergone by the intern as part of the internship.  To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection and the Employment Services Division of FÁS are monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports that are required to be submitted by the host organisation verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement.  Monitoring also includes random site visits to host organisations and interns.  A ‘whistle blowing' feature has been introduced, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the National Call Centre.  All such claims will be investigated.While developing JobBridge, officials from my Department looked at similar models around the world, both in private and public sector organisations.  I believe that the measures put in place are currently sufficient in relation to the operation of the JobBridge scheme.  However, my Department continuously monitors the scheme and will introduce additional measures if the need arises.  The aim of the scheme is to provide those seeking employment with the opportunity to gain valuable work experience, maintain close links with the labour market and to enhance their skills and competencies through a quality internship opportunity.Under JobBridge criteria, host organisations are not permitted to advertise an internship requesting experience.  The internship application clearly sets this out.  Where host organisations request prior experience in their internship advertisement, the National Contact Centre agents in FÁS should not process the application in its current form.  In the event that an application is inadvertently processed it will be removed from the website as soon as the error is noticed.FÁS employment services are continually monitoring the internships to ensure they provide a meaningful experience for the intern.  This requires, in some instances, direct interaction with potential host organisations before the internship is advertised to seek further clarification on the internship experience.  In addition, a small group has been set up made up of FÁS and Department of Social Protection staff to regularly review host organisation applications.

The contributory principle, however, does rely on adequate real contributions being made to fund the system.  As outlined in previous replies there is a link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right — if and when particular contingencies arise.A person on maternity leave will avail of maternity benefit if she has made sufficient contributions and if she has sufficient contributions prior to maternity leave she may avail of carer's benefit.  Otherwise she may apply for carer's allowance, which as I mentioned in previous replies, has one of the most generous means tests within the welfare system.  To maintain an adequate system of social protection for everyone, as well as achieving future economic stability and growth, we have to ensure sustainable public finances through a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Given the current economic situation we are not in a position to consider the effective expansion of eligibility for any of our schemes and I have no plans to amend the PRSI contributions requirement for carer's benefit.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 28 together.I am very conscious of the needs of people on social welfare and fully appreciate that a wide range of groups depend solely on their welfare payments. As we approach a very tough Budget in December, I will be doing my utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in our society, including carers. Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for maintaining an adequate system of social protection as well as for achieving future economic stability and growth. For these reasons, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy. Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure and prioritise resources in my Department (as will be the case in all other Departments) in 2012 and in later years.My Department will spend over €650 million this year on carers across a number of schemes. There are currently 51,600 people in receipt of carers allowance from my Department; of these, almost 22,000 are getting half-rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment.  The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carers allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.This Government's policy is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities as far as possible.  In the case of people being cared for at home, the care they receive is usually a balance of support from family and professional help.  My Department provides income supports for family carers while the Department of Health and Children and the HSE provides professional support.  No final decisions have been made to date in relation to welfare expenditure next year, including in carers allowance.  These decisions will be made, after full consideration, by the Government and will be announced on Budget day.

Until accommodation is available in Balbriggan, supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) payments for parts of the Balbriggan area of North County Dublin, is administered from an office of the Department located at 77 Upper Gardiner Street, Dublin 1.  The location was chosen as it is on a direct bus route from the Balbriggan area to facilitate, in so far as is possible, customer appointments with the community welfare service.Once approved, SWA payments are generally posted directly to the recipient's home address, issued to the post office of the customer's choice by postal draft or lodged directly to the customer's bank account.  Applications for SWA can also be made by post and queries can be dealt with by telephone, thus reducing the need for the customer to visit the office.  It is the Department's intention to have community welfare services, including SWA, provided in Balbriggan as soon as suitable accommodation is available.

Their transfer to the Department is a first and vital step in the full integration of the services provided by the CWS and the Department.  Prior to their arrival and particularly in the nine month period of their secondment from January 1st this year, intensive planning has been underway between the Department and the HSE to make the necessary arrangements for the accommodation of staff and the integration of services. The various HR, facilities and administrative systems, such as payroll records and IT systems have now been put in place for the former CWS staff.As regards the accommodation and the location of the community welfare service, while the staff will continue to be headquartered at their current base location/town, opportunities for co-location with other Department staff will be pursued, as appropriate. I can assure the Deputy that any changes that may be proposed in relation to geographical deployment will take account of the relevant provisions on staff deployment contained in the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.In preparing for the full integration of CWS services with those of the Department and also the integration with the FÁS Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes, the Department is currently undergoing a process of intensive planning for the establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service, as provided for in the Programme for Government.  The NEES Project Plan was approved by Government in July and was published in August 2011.  The transfer of the community welfare service to my Department is therefore an integral part of the process of developing and implementing the National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).The objective is to integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit which will provide, the ‘one stop shop' to which the Deputy refers for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seeking employment and, or, advice about their training options.  As part to the NEES project plan, a number of pilot ‘one-stop shops' will be established in 2012 and following this initial pilot a phased roll-out of one-stop shops is planned over the period from  2012 to  2014.  The pilots will enable us to develop and monitor the logistical and practical challenges in integrating all the employment and benefit support services that the Department now provides.

The "Motor Trades" category accounts for a significant proportion of the fall in the volume of retail sales.  Any changes to the schemes and services operated by my Department, including changes to rates of payments, will be informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which has been completed by my Department, with the key decisions being made in the context of framing the Budget for 2012.

My Department will spend over €530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance.  In 2005 there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of €280 million.  The costs have almost doubled in six years while the number of customers has risen by more than 20%.An intern participating in JobBridge will continue to receive the social welfare entitlements, including secondary entitlements such as fuel allowance, that they were receiving immediately prior to commencing the scheme.  However, during their JobBridge internship, interns will not receive additional benefits, such as fuel allowance, if they were previously not entitled to this benefit before they began their internship.  The objective of the JobBridge scheme is to keep unemployed people close to the labour market and to give them the opportunity to gain quality work experience thereby increasing their employability.

Their assessments conform to the ethical conduct and behavioural guidelines of the Medical Council.  Medical Assessors are required to be medical practitioners who are on the general register of medical practitioners while holding an appointment.  They must have at least six years' satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since registration.  Many of the Medical Assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications.  They also have special training in eligibility assessment and disability evaluation.The Medical Assessors have an ongoing commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced.  Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons called for assessment are fully safeguarded.  Their own certifiers are advised of the scheduled assessments and invited to submit any appropriate medical reports including references to any recent assessments by consultants.  In addition it is open to a certifier to attend an assessment if he or she so wishes.  A Nurse Attendant is always present during assessments.In carrying out assessments the Medical Assessor considers all medical evidence presented and expresses an opinion based on findings.  All assessments are carried out in accordance with the accepted guidelines of the Irish Medical Council.The Medical Assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities, resulting from disease or injury, affects the person's ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.  Assessments are conducted in a fair, equitable, impartial and independent manner to the highest standards in accordance with accepted medical practice and ethics.  They are also conducted in a manner which displays full regard for the dignity and integrity of the person being assessed.If a decision, based on the opinion of a Medical Advisor, is unfavourable to a customer, the customer has a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. Before an appeal is heard by an Appeals Officer, the customer is afforded a second medical assessment by a different Medical Assessor to the one who gave the original unfavourable opinion.  Should the Deputy have any specific case(s) which causes him concern, these can be reviewed by the Chief Medical Adviser.

There are currently 721,000 people in receipt of free travel, not including spouses or companions.  It will cost €77 million this year.  The ‘National Recovery Plan 2011-2014' provided that funding for the free travel scheme was to remain at 2010 levels of expenditure for the duration of the plan.The current free travel scheme operated by my Department provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 90 private transport operators.  All of the schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection, including free travel, are being examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the upcoming budget.  The outcome of this review will inform the Department's decisions in relation to expenditure on schemes in 2012 and into the future.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Marriages of convenience, or "sham marriages" are defined as marriages which are entered into for the purpose of one of the parties gaining an automatic right of residency based on marriage to a person who already has a right of residency.  These marriages exploit Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which deals with the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.  This directive came into force on April 20th 2006.The matter was further compounded by the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case on 25th July 2008, which held that these rights applied to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals.   I am aware that procedures to prevent marriages of convenience are in place in other EU member states, and I would hope that equivalent measures might be introduced here.  This matter is being researched with a view to identifying what measures may be taken, including the possibility of legislating for any such measures. I would hope to be in a position to introduce legislation on this, and other aspects of civil registration, in 2012.In the meantime, revised guidelines for registrars for marriage notifications containing requirements concerning notification procedures, including the verification of identity and marital status, have been issued by the Registrar General to all registrars. The Registrar General has been advised that these measures are the most that can be taken to prevent marriages of convenience in the absence of legislation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held. The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.Significant resources have been devoted to BTEA. €519million has been allocated over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2007-13.  The budget for BTEA in 2011 is €198.8 million which represents over 10% of an increase on 2010 expenditure which was €179.85million.  The number of participants engaged with BTEA has grown steadily in recent years. Annual statistics are collated by the Department for the number of participants awarded the back to education allowance on the basis of the relevant academic year.  As of 11th November 2011, there were 25,226 participants approved for the BTEA scheme.  In the 2010/2011 academic year there were 25,032 participants which represented an increase of 20.3% on the previous year (20,808).

However, my Department will spend over €530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance.  In 2005 there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of €280 million.  The costs have almost doubled in six years while the number of customers has risen by more than 20%.My Department is covering the cost of the price increases in electricity which came into effect from 1st October.  The electricity allowance, which was €35.80 per month, has increased to €39.40.  The price increases will cost the Department over €4 million in 2011 and €17.3 million in a full year.   Difficult decisions had to be made in light of the existing economic situation and commitments made by the previous government.  A number of measures for savings in 2011 and future years were specified as part of Budget 2011 but were not announced by the Government at the time.  These included a saving of €30 million in the energy and telephone elements of the household benefits package in 2011 and subsequent years.  They also included the abolition of the smokeless fuel allowance with a saving of €7.7 million in 2011 and €17.5 million in subsequent years. The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance were reduced from 2,400 to 1,800 with a view to generating savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.Excess winter deaths are generally defined as the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July).Ireland, in common with other European countries, experiences higher levels of mortality in the winter than in the summer. Studies have found that mortality increases as mean daily temperatures fall (below 18 degrees).  However, it is the countries with (relatively) the mildest winters in Europe which report the greatest excess deaths. This has been termed the ‘paradox of excess winter mortality'.  There is no simple clear cut explanation for excess winter mortality.  The factors include the increased prevalence of influenza and cold viruses during the winter months; older age — especially for people aged 75 years and over or those who are frail; poverty/fuel poverty; poor housing stock; living alone.The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce consumption of energy through improving the home's thermal efficiency.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered the Warmer Homes programme for privately owned low-income households since 2001, benefiting 65,000 households, with a further 15,000 to receive upgrades this year. A similar programme is in place for local authority houses.We should also bear in mind that data show that households comprising predominantly older people have lower consistent poverty rates than other age categories. In 2009 single adults aged over 65 with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 0.6% while people in households with 2 adults at least one of whom was aged 65 or over with no children had a consistent poverty rate of 1.0%.   In the general population, 5.5% of people were in consistent poverty.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (2009) also showed that the elderly were less likely than other groups to have gone without heating in the previous year.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Any proposal to extend short term benefits such as jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social welfare benefits, including jobseeker's benefit, pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition their employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356, the rate of employers PRSI is 4.25%).In this context it may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared to employees.  In terms of benefits the 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over 10 times what he contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who only gets 3 times what he and his employer contribute — despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.   PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.

A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add between €1 and €2 per employee per week to the costs of employment.

Under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking motor insurance, if he/she has approached at least three motor insurers and has not been able to obtain cover. In general, the motor insurer first approached will be required to provide the individual with a quote. If it is impossible to identify which insurer was the first approached for a quote, then a rota of insurers comes into effect.  The only grounds on which a motor insurer can refuse cover is in circumstances where the provision of motor insurance would be contrary to the public interest. The agreement is administered by a committee made up of representatives of each of the companies who have signed the agreement. The Committee can decide whether a quote is so high, or the terms so excessive, as to make the quote tantamount to a refusal, in which case it will review the matter.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134 (1)(a) of the Finance Act 1992 provides that a vehicle may be registered without the payment of vehicle registration tax (VRT), if the vehicle is "the personal property of a private individual and is being brought permanently into the State by the individual when he is transferring his normal residence from a place outside the State to a place in the State."  However, specific conditions are attached to the use of such a vehicle for a defined period after it is brought into the State.  These conditions are detailed in Statutory Instrument No. 59 of 1993 (Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993).  Regulation 4(6) of these Regulations requires that the vehicle be used solely by the registered owner for a period of 12 months from the date of registration in the State.  It provides that:"A vehicle in respect of which the relief aforesaid has been granted shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of, hired out,  lent or given as security in the State during the period of 12 months following its registration by the Commissioners..."In addition, Section 134 of the Finance Act 1992 provides for permanent exemption from payment of VRT in a number of other, specific, cases.Section 135 allows the temporary exemption from the payment of VRT where the vehicle is brought into the State by an individual established outside the State for such individual's private or business use. In this regard Irish legislation (SI  60 of 1993) allows the vehicle to remain in the State  "for a period not exceeding 12 months" which is more generous than that allowed by EU directives, i.e.  period not exceeding 185 days in any 12 month period.It should be noted that Ireland is in compliance with EU directives on permanent and temporary exemptions from registration at this time.  I have no plans at present to abolish or reduce vehicle registration tax applying to vehicles coming here from other EU countries.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products, that they are aware of the threat to the Exchequer posed by laundered fuel. The predominant illicit activity in the mineral oil area in both Northern Ireland and the Republic is the laundering of marked diesel and its sale through illegal outlets. In both jurisdictions the respective difference in excise rates between marked (rebated) and normal diesel offers a considerable incentive for oil laundering and this illicit activity poses a serious threat to the Exchequer and the economy on both sides of the border.The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to accurately estimate the loss to the national exchequer from individual activities within the shadow economy such as fuel laundering.  Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils. These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; closure of unlicensed or improperly licensed outlets and seizure of stock and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.So far this year, nine oil laundries have been detected, together with 327,000 litres of laundered fuel, and nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles have been seized. Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of two of these cases. The Deputy will appreciate that there is some time-span between the detection of an offence and the appearance of a defendant before the courts. So far in 2011, in addition to the 327,000 litres of fuel seized in the course of raids on oil laundries, a further 516,270 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. Revenue has obtained two convictions in the courts this year against the proprietors of filling stations that were found to be selling laundered mineral oil as auto diesel.Revenue is currently engaged in a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and the challenging of other instances of non-compliance. As part of this drive, warning letters have been issued to unlicensed retail outlets and a number of these have been effectively closed down by the actions of Revenue enforcement teams. This campaign is ongoing and Revenue is in the process of seizing illicit product and closing down a further number of unlicensed or otherwise illegal retail outlets. This month alone, in a recent targeted enforcement operation by Revenue officers, ten filling stations, one fuel depot and two private dwellings in counties Dublin, Galway and Louth were raided. A total of 158,000 litres of fuel were seized from three of these premises, including two tankers of fuel, and approximately €39,000 was detained under the Proceeds of Crime legislation.Revenue is currently reviewing its enforcement options in the context of reductions in the sulphur content of some fuels that have been introduced under recent EU environment legislation.  The matters being addressed include the potential development of an enhanced fuel marker. In this regard, close liaison has been established with HM Revenue & Customs. Revenue is also considering strengthening the Regulations governing the keeping for sale of fuel products and a renewed focus on links in the laundered fuel supply chain.The Irish Petrol Retailers Association, which represents the majority of legitimate retail outlets in the State, is working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to counteract the threat posed by the sale and distribution of illicit mineral oil.Revenue is an integrated tax and customs administration and staff are not allocated by function. The Deputy will be aware that Revenue's overall staff numbers have been reduced over the past two years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers and now stand at approximately 5,940.  However, the Revenue Commissioners assure me that that their staff resources deployed in anti-evasion enforcement have been maintained and are indeed augmented when specific operations are organised.

The appropriate moneylending application form (new or renewal) must be completed and returned to the Central Bank with a number of items, for review and consideration. Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended), (the Act) sets out the Central Bank's powers in relation to the grant or refusal of a moneylender's license.In addition to the licensing system, the Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders . This Code applies to moneylenders licensed under the Act. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank’s website: www.centralbank.ie.  Compliance with the Code is monitored on an ongoing basis through themed inspections, mystery shopping, consumer intelligence and complaints from the Financial Services Ombudsman. Failure to adhere to the provisions of the Code may lead to proceedings under the Central Bank’s Administrative Sanctions Procedures. These procedures enable the Central Bank to sanction and to fine entities, regulated by the Bank, for breaches of regulatory requirements.The Code sets out "General Principles" with which a moneylender must comply, such that it must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its consumers. The Code also places requirements on moneylenders in relation to: (1) Unsolicited contact (cold-calling) and unsolicited credit facilities, (2) Handling complaints, (3) Arrears and guarantees, and (4) Debt collection.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Moneylending firms in Ireland are licensed by the Central Bank under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  Interest rates and financial products, including those of moneylenders, are not regulated by the Central Bank and each institution can determine the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, including risk. Interest rate caps for moneylenders are not provided for in the Act and it should be noted that there are no interest rate caps in relation to the industry categories which the Central Bank supervises (apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector).However, the Central Bank have advised me that they are endeavouring to increase disclosure and understanding of the costs associated with loans from moneylenders. The Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders. Under Common Rule 3b of the Code, prior to entering into an agreement with a consumer, a moneylender must indicate prominently the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher. The disclosure must take the following form "Warning: this is a high-cost loan". The Code also places some requirements on moneylenders in relation to advertising. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank's website www.centralbank.ie.Furthermore, the annual percentage rate allowable under moneylending licences is publically stated on the public register for moneylenders. This register is available on the Central Bank's website.  While it is noted that moneylender loans can be more expensive than other forms of credit, many of these loans are unique in nature. For example, they may be small value loans, over a short term and repayments may be collected at the consumer's home.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I wish to make clear that I and my colleagues in Government are deeply concerned that this draft confidential information has become public before Government had finally made all of the necessary budgetary decisions. Furthermore, we are concerned at the manner in which this information was put into the public domain.  As the Deputy will be well aware, we are in a programme of financial support with the EU and the IMF.  As part of this programme, we are obliged to share information with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF — the External Partners.  Such information is shared on a confidential basis with the understanding that its circulation is restricted.  As such, certain draft technical information which is clearly signalled as being still subject to Government decisions is transmitted to the External Partners. This information flow is part of the necessary transmission of information which is required to facilitate discussions amongst senior officials at Eurogroup Working Group level.Following each review mission by the external partners, the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Letters of Intent, the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. These are discussed between the partners and authorities in draft format before being signed and published.Each review considers both the performance against targets to date and progress in relation to future commitments.  A key concern at all stages of the process is the sustainability of the fiscal position.  In that context, the external partners requested information about Ireland's next steps, specifically measures to be introduced in the Budget. While the Government agreed to provide broad outlines in October, it was also explained that the final shape of the budget would not be known until budget day.While the overall scale of adjustment required each year out to 2015 was published in the Government's Medium Term Fiscal Strategy, the External Partners sought further specific information to facilitate approval of the review and thus the next draw-down of funds under the programme. It was in this context that the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform provided some additional data on budgetary options on the understanding that this was for internal troika use as well as for background briefing by the Commission to the EuroGroup Working Group and the Economic and Financial Committee only. This information was marked both draft and confidential and was contained within square brackets in the text — which is the normal way of showing that the relevant text remains to be finalised and subject to further decision making. On many occasions during the troika review mission and since then, we highlighted that such material was indicative and had to be agreed by Government before the documents could be finalised.As I understand it, and notwithstanding the strict confidentiality applied to the material supplied to the troika, this information was sent by Commission staff to the German Finance Ministry. It was then forwarded by them to their Parliament.  Neither Government nor the Irish officials were informed that this transmission of confidential budgetary documentation would take place. Further, that this occurred before the information was agreed by Government and then provided to the Oireachtas serves only to heighten our concerns.  Since becoming aware of the leak and the internal Commission process that they have in place we have raised our serious concerns with the Commission and also with the German authorities.In conclusion, I will repeat that the Government did not approve the transmission of this information to the German Parliament, and that I and my Government colleagues are very concerned at this development. We must nevertheless recognise that we remain in a programme and continue to rely on the support of the External Partners.  In expressing our concern, we need also to continue working with our partners.  Last night, I laid the relevant draft documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas, in order to make the information available to all.

I have since announced that I will be proposing an increase in the standard rate of VAT of 2 percentage points from 21% to 23%.  This change is being introduced as part of a general package of revenue-raising measures to contribute to Exchequer funding and is in line with commitments made in the programme for Government and in the EU/IMF Programme.As regards the hospitality sector, the proposed VAT increase will have no impact on tourism related services, which were the subject of a generous reduction in VAT to 9% earlier this year.  While the VAT on all standard rated goods and services, including alcohol, is due to increase, restaurant services and hotel and holiday accommodation will continue to apply at the 9% rate.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	477	A stamp duty levy of 0.6% applies to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation.  The levy is a charge for a temporary period on the significant assets of pension funds, much of which are represented by investments outside of Ireland.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 legislation which gives effect to the pension fund levy provisions makes clear that it is to apply for a four year period only.The various measures in the Initiative represent the first steps by this Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and facilitating the return to work of people currently unemployed.  The levy is a reasonable and targeted tax measure being introduced to fund the various measures set out in the Jobs Initiative.  The country is facing an economic and unemployment crisis and the Jobs Initiative will help tackle that crisis and applying a temporary levy to pension funds is less damaging economically than raising other taxes.Individuals may be affected in different ways by the pension fund levy.  I am not in a position to comment on what the precise impact of the levy will be in all cases on individuals or individual funds, schemes, members or retired members as this depends, for example, on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for.I can say that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provisions include certain safeguards in this area.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, will be entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must essentially be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.The Revenue Commissioners are given authority to review any case where assets are disposed of by administrators or trustees in order to pay the levy so as to ensure that any such disposals are in keeping with or needed to pay the levy.The Revenue Commissioners are also afforded oversight authority to review, where they consider it appropriate, instances where benefits are adjusted as a result of the payment of the levy to ensure that any such adjustment is in keeping with the requirements of the levy legislation.  In undertaking any such review Revenue may consult with appropriate experts as they see fit.  However, before Revenue could act in that regard, instances of concern on foot of actual adjustments made would first have to be brought to their attention.As regards speculation that the Government would now proceed to "raid" investment funds or deposit accounts, I want to assure you that the Government has no plans whatsoever in this regard.  The Government regards it as its top priority to safeguard the security of savings and would not wish to consider any step that would impact negatively upon confidence in this area.  Other savings or investment products have not benefited from the generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive.  Deposit accounts and savings products have already been subjected to additional taxation in recent budgets, via the increase in the rate of DIRT and exit taxes, neither of which impacted on pension funds.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	478	As the Deputy may be aware, this issue was the subject of a topical issues debate in the Dáil put down by Deputy Niall Collins on 15 November last.  As the Deputy is aware, in an effort to recoup some of its higher input funding costs, Bank of Ireland is changing the method of calculating its interest rate on its term lending facilities from the current EURIBOR derived reference rates to a reference rate based on "Bank Cost of Funds".The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the interest rates they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned. Interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, and an institution's overall funding.  As in the case with mortgage interest rates, I have no statutory function in relation to business interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.I do appreciate that this increase will be difficult for some business customers to absorb.  As I understand it, the Bank has written to its business customers inviting them to contact their respective Relationship Managers who will assist them in managing the impact of this change and look at potential solutions for their businesses.On the general issue of interest rates, the Financial Regulator and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated in his report of 11 November 2011 to the Taoiseach on the issue of passing on mortgage interest rate adjustments following ECB actions, the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interest rates is not sought by the Central Bank.  Similar principles apply in relation to business interest rates.  The Deputy Governor has indicated that the Central Bank will, within its existing powers and through suasion, engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard mortgage variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.He has indicated that experience of such controls in the past and in other countries does not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning.  Binding controls tend to reduce availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit.  The Regulator indicates that this could have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors into the market.  By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would, especially during this recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	479	There a number of measures in place to assist people who are having genuine difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments.  The Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.  The Code came into effect on 1 January 2011.With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the required systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the Code.  The Code sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears or are in pre-arrears.  For the purposes of the Code a "pre-arrears" case arises when the borrower contacts the lender stating that he or she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about getting into mortgage arrears.  The Code can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie.  The Central Bank has produced, with input from the National Consumer Agency, a consumer guide to assist consumers in understanding the new process under the revised Code.Prior to the Summer recess, the Economic Management Council asked an Inter-Departmental Group to consider further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness.  As the Deputy is aware, the Group's report has now been published and it is still the subject of a detailed and very worthwhile debate in the Dáil.However, progress has already been made in response to acting on a number of the recommendations of the Inter Departmental Report and work has commenced across a number of Departments and agencies.  These will build on the measures already in place to assist mortgage holders such as the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.The Inter-Departmental report identified reform of personal insolvency law as a critical measure to tackle mortgage distress.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has now undertaken extensive work on the development of a Bill to bring forward the necessary legislative provisions in order to modernise the law in this regard.  This is being advanced as a priority matter.In line with the report's recommendations, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has commenced work on the implementation of an initiative to progress the mortgage-to-rent concept.  The initiative will operate on a pilot basis initially and work is now well advanced with a lender and an approved housing body to progress the initiative as soon as possible.My own Department is undertaking a process of direct engagement with banks on the development of voluntary approaches by mortgage lenders.  In addition, the Central Bank has also asked mortgage lenders to produce detailed mortgage arrears resolution strategies and implementation plans as a matter of urgency for submission by the end of November.This Dáil is, of course, continuing its debate on the Inter-Departmental Report and Government has stated that it will consider and take into account the many contributions made, both inside and outside the House, to this debate in its ongoing efforts to address the problem of mortgage difficulty.  Once the Dáil debate has concluded, and following assessment of the points raised, I will bring proposals to Government on next steps including an implementation mechanism.  This will enable the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental report to be progressed in a co-ordinated fashion in order to provide effective and meaningful solutions for those borrowers that are facing difficulties in meeting their mortgage commitments.Arising out of the report of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears published late last year, lenders representing the majority of the market have already implemented or indicated their willingness to implement a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) or a variation of it as recommended by the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt in late 2010.  A DIS is intended to allow borrowers, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years.Financial assistance is available to eligible claimants under the Department of Social Protection's Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme.  People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential, and independent service.

The tax revenue profile published in the early days of February this year estimated that almost €5½ billion or close to 16 per cent of the total Budget day tax revenue forecast of €34.9 billion would be collected this month.  It is important to a have sense of the outturn for tax revenues and indeed for expenditure in the month of November before finalising the Budget.  It is primarily for this reason that the Budget is usually presented to the Dáil in early December.  This year the Budget will be presented on Tuesday, 6th December.

This includes reviewing powers, penalties, etc, and making recommendations to my Department where legislative amendments are required.  The ongoing review of effectiveness includes consideration of alternative approaches, as referred to by the Deputy, to tackling the illicit removal of fuel marker. General consideration has been given, in this context, to a rebate system.  However, Revenue advises me that such a system would pose different problems.  It would involve the establishment of a very extensive repayment system, giving rise to a very significant administrative burden for oil traders, consumers and for Revenue and would pose significant cash-flow difficulties for those who currently use marked gas oil.  Repayment regimes are vulnerable to abuse and liable to be exploited by criminal elements, such as those currently involved in fuel laundering.

As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.  The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish.  Only when these steps have been implemented, the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered.A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012.  The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.

School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that it is absolutely necessary.  In addition, my Department has consistently encouraged schools to put in place book rental schemes as the most effective means of lowering costs for all parents.  A number of web-based school book exchange schemes are also in operation.I have endorsed the thrust of the NCCA's proposals for junior cycle reform.  These will be implemented at a pace which the system can sustain.  For example, a revised syllabus in English will be implemented as a first step in the process, for students beginning junior cycle in 2014, for first examination in 2017.  Groups of 4-5 subjects will be implemented on a phased basis each year after that.  The selection of texts and resources is a matter for decision by schools locally.  However, the phased implementation of the reforms should mean that the cost of new texts, where they are necessary, is spread over a number of years.  In addition, a cap of 8 subjects or equivalent is being placed on the number of subjects which can be taken for examination purposes, to apply on a mandatory basis from the 2017 examination.In regard to the provision of short courses, developed locally by schools, the intention is that these may be provided on an optional basis by schools from within their existing staffing ratio.  There is no intention that this should give rise to additional fees for parents.

To date over 70,000 teachers have been registered with the Council.  Under Section 23 of the Act, the Council has statutory authority to charge a fee which is set at €90 per year at present.  The fee is payable by all registered teachers regardless of their employment status.  The fee is considered reasonable compared with that levied by other professional regulatory bodies which also do not differentiate based on level of employment.

An Institute's academic council has statutory responsibility to protect, maintain and develop the academic standards of the institute and, subject to the approval of the Governing Body, for the making of academic regulations of the Institute including those governing the conduct of examinations. Accordingly the investigation of allegations of cheating is a matter for the Institute's management authorities and its academic council and neither my Department nor I have any role in the matter.

They envisage that all students will be expected to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of their junior cycle.  These include developing an understanding of the natural world, learning how to think and act sustainably, understanding the distribution of social, economic and environmental phenomena, valuing local and national heritage and recognising the relevance of the past to current national and international issues and events.It is clear therefore that geographical and historical awareness skills will be necessary to achieve the required outcomes. Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible. This issue will be taken forward in the discussions on implementation with the partners in education.

The time allocation recommended is one class period per week.  To support schools in delivering SPHE, a curriculum framework along with implementation guidelines have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The Department, through the SPHE and other support services, delivers a range of continuing professional development courses to upskill teachers on an ongoing basis.  A total of 12,933 teachers have received training through the SPHE Support Service since 2004. It is a matter for each school to ensure that teachers delivering the programme are suitably qualified and engage in appropriate continuing professional development.

The remainder are specialist PLC colleges which do not provide the second level curriculum. Final data from all schools or 2011/12 has not been fully processed yet.The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. It is already supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory. Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well being of children, to help them create and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.  The implementation of the SPHE curriculum is supported by national programmes of professional development for teachers at primary and post primary level provided by the curriculum support services.

The Government agreed to the drafting of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill to provide for the establishment of a Statutory Fund to support the needs of victims of residential institutional abuse, as endorsed by Dáil Éireann in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report in 2009. The legislative proposals followed extensive consultations with survivors of residential abuse and the groups which support them, together with a public consultation process. In this context, the report on the consultation process and the General Scheme of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill are available on my Department's website.It is the case that some former residents advocated a simple distribution of the available money rather than the establishment of the Statutory Fund. However, as I outlined when I published the legislative proposals, I believe that the Fund should target resources at services to support former residents' needs. The General Scheme outlines the range of services proposed.I had a very constructive meeting with groups representing survivors of residential institutional abuse on 22nd July last, when we discussed the Government's approach to the proposed Statutory Fund. Attendees at that meeting raised a number of issues regarding aspects of the proposed approach as set out in the General Scheme of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill. I have also received a number of submissions from groups and individuals in relation to the proposed legislation. Work is progressing on the drafting of the Bill and the various views expressed to date are being considered as the drafting process continues.

Pupils with Down syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant support.A review of the General Allocation Model has been undertaken and completed by my Department. The issue of whether Down syndrome should be classified as a low incidence disability in all instances was considered as part of this review.  My Department has also received a submission from Down Syndrome Ireland regarding this matter.  The recommendations of the review of the General Allocation Model and the submission from Down Syndrome Ireland are being considered in the context of my Department's Employment Control Framework obligations, competing demands on teacher numbers, and educational resources.

Ireland must adhere to its agreed economic recovery programme in order to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015 and to restore our independence. This will mean that forthcoming budgets will involve further adjustments in taxation and public spending. Regrettably, education cannot be spared from this adjustment as the size of the challenge is so large. This is the unfortunate legacy caused by the reckless economic management of the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government.The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is undertaking a Comprehensive Expenditure Review across all areas of Government spending. This process will inform funding allocations for the coming years. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that in line with normal practice I am unable to comment on future savings options during the budgetary deliberative process.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The use of rainwater harvesting systems in buildings is a relatively new practice in Ireland.  It is not OPW policy to install such systems in all new buildings.  However, for the last number of years the installation of these systems has been considered as part of the design process for new buildings. Rainwater harvesting systems have been installed in a number of projects to date including new offices in Wexford, Killarney, and Roscommon. Rainwater harvesting systems also formed part of the design for a number of projects that did not proceed to construction.The installed systems have in general proved problematic and have incurred significant ongoing maintenance costs. Whereas the use of these systems has obvious advantages, we are in the phase of learning from experience in the buildings that have been completed to date.There is no programme for retrofitting such systems into existing buildings due to the significant capital outlay required to modify the plumbing within the building to facilitate the systems. The current emphasis for the OPW is on water conservation. A recent pilot study in a number of large buildings has identified that there is significant scope for reducing water consumption within the existing OPW portfolio. A programme of automatic water metering in all large State buildings is proposed for 2012. In buildings where consumption remains high despite conservation efforts, rainwater harvesting may prove economically feasible. In such cases the retrofitting of these systems shall be considered.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	515	In undertaking the recent capital investment reviews, each Government Department was requested to prepare a submission providing the following:a description of the high level objective to be achieved in relation to each programme;an outline of the rationale for Government intervention;an assessment of the consistency of the investment programme with the Programme for Government;details of how each investment programme would support economic recovery;details of how each investment programme would support sustainable employment as well as employment in the immediate delivery phase;details of how each investment programme would meet critical economic and social infrastructure deficits;an outline of each Department's legally binding contractual commitments for each year up to 2016, including a list of all committed planned capital projects of over €4m in value;details of whether a given programme is primarily delivered by the Department or Agencies of the Department;the current expenditure implications of proposed future capital investment; andthe broad outputs and outcomes expected from each proposed capital investment.In addition, Departments were also requested to outline the programmes which would be afforded priority in the context of a lower Departmental envelope.From this information, my Department prepared a report for the Government about a capital investment programme for the next five years. The financial baseline was the public capital programme in the National Recovery Plan (November 2010), adjusted on a technical basis for transfers of function that had occurred in the interim. The analysis drew on a range of economic literature and various data sources, both domestic and international. Secondary analysis is cited in the document. In addition, a number of external experts and organisations made submissions to the review including the Economic and Social Research Institute, Forfás, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Academy of Engineering, the   Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.Having considered this analysis, the Government decided on an approach  and allocations as published on 10 November last. The main decision criteria used in setting the Government's investment priorities were the extent to which programmes and projects are consistent with the Programme for Government objectives (including returning to sustainable public finances), sustainable employment (as well as employment in the immediate delivery phase) and   meet critical economic and social infrastructure deficits.The figure of €17 billion Exchequer investment from 2012 to 2016 represents a level of expenditure that can both make an important contribution to budgetary consolidation and deliver a level of infrastructure and capital investment that will assist in a return to sustainable economic growth and job creation.  The Medium Term Capital Investment Framework forms part of the Government's Budget and Estimates, and I intend that background documentation in relation to the Capital report will be made available at the time of the Budget.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The programme measures announced in Budget 2011 were designed to yield an additional level of savings in 2012 of just over €80 million.  The 2011 Budget also included a multi-annual Employment Control Framework through which public pay bill savings can be achieved over a number of years by reducing public sector staffing numbers, subject to further policy decisions at Departmental and Agency level to adhere to the agreed aggregate ceilings. At the time of the publication of the National Recovery Plan 2011 — 2014 in November 2011, the 2012 additional savings from these measures were estimated at almost €400 million in 2012.  The decisions necessary to give effect to these savings projections are currently being considered by the Government, consistent with the updated fiscal adjustment path set out in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, published on 4 November 2011.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The Government recently announced (17th November, 2011) that the Decentralisation Programme should be cancelled in the light of the budgetary and staffing outlook.  Those projects where there is no permanent accommodation or advance party in place are to be cancelled. Details of the cancelled projects, together with the moves involved, are set out at Table 1.Projects for which permanent accommodation has been provided and to which staffing assignments are substantially completed are to be left in situ, to be managed in the same way as other regionally based offices and Departments. Details of these projects and the staff moved are set out at Table 2.My Department will review, in liaison with the OPW and the relevant Departments, the viability and future prospects of the remainder of the projects, having regard to the current budgetary and staffing constraints affecting the public service generally. I will bring proposals to Government later this year in relation to these. These projects include those where temporary accommodation has been provided, and some others that have business/operational effectiveness issues that require further consideration. The majority of these projects were decentralised as viable/stand alone units and moved in accordance with detailed implementation plans.  Details of these projects and the moves involved are set out at Table 3.The 2009 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) includes an audit of property management under the decentralisation programme. This report identified capital expenditure on the Programme of 289.4 million euro on property and recurring costs (leases) of 7 million euro (as at April 2010).  Dublin property disposals were 356m euro and leases with an annual value of 10m euro over the same period were surrendered.  Non-property costs in the order of 30m euro were incurred, including the costs of decentralising offices and the OPW's spend on dedicated staffing for the programme.The figures provided have not been updated since April 2010 as there has been very little activity on the Programme since then, due to the deferral for budgetary reasons in October 2008 of the implementation of the elements of the programme remaining to be completed at that time.  My Department has asked the OPW and others to provide details to it on the additional property costs in respect of the period from April 2010 up to the cancellation of the programme, as well as details of any additional disposals made. It has also sought information from Departments on the non-property costs for the same period, which may need to take account of the need to reattribute some costs to reflect the changes in Ministerial responsibilities since February of this year.

In the Irish Public Sector, a mix of accounting bases is currently in use. Accrual accounting is already the norm in the commercial sector and has been introduced in much of the non-commercial public sector outside the civil service.The Programme for Government includes a provision that requires Public Sector Bodies to publish balance sheets and to move to accruals accounting. Planning for the introduction of accrual accounting in central government is underway and this will include any necessary legislative changes. Initial work on the delivery of this provision has commenced with the Appropriation Accounts 2011 for Government Departments and Offices where each departmental account will include a balance sheet.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21437	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The role of my Department is to drive Ireland's competitiveness and productivity by creating the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities are grown and maintained.  Funding is provided to a number of State Agencies under its aegis including that of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.The role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises.  The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.While my Department provides funding to the CEBs neither I or my Department officials have any role or function in the day-to-day decision making activities of the Boards.  The CEBs are independent companies, limited by guarantee and therefore legal entities in their own right.  Decisions on applications for assistance from the CEBs are made independently by the Boards, subject to eligibility criteria, on the advice of their evaluation committees.Any enquiry relating to individual CEB applications should therefore be made in the first instance to the relevant CEB.  The CEB in Kildare may be contacted at: Kildare County Enterprise Board, The Woods, Clane, Co. Kildare; Phone No: 045 861707; Fax No: 045 861712; Email: info@kildareceb.ie; Website: wwww.kildareceb.ie.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21437	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	521	My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.  The role of the CEBs throughout the country is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.The CEBs' unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.  The Boards give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services, and support micro-enterprise businesses provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  CEBs can assist in the establishment, and/or development, of new and existing micro-enterprise businesses subject to the following main eligibility criteria;the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere;the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service;the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation;the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people;the enterprise must not give rise to deadweight or displacement.It is considered inappropriate to support areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, etc, as it is considered that these generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc.  The project promoter should therefore in the first instance contact their local CEB to discuss what options may be available to her.  Contact details for each of the Boards is available through their national website www.enterpriseboards.ie. Meath CEB may be contacted directly at Meath County Enterprise Board, Navan Enterprise Centre, Trim Road, Navan, Co. Meath, tel. 046-9078400, email mhceb@meath.com, website www.meath.com.In addition to the supports and services of the state agencies under the aegis of my Department, the promoter may also wish to be made aware that the Department of Social Protection also provides assistance through various Back to Work (Enterprise) Schemes and an Employer (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.  In addition and subject to certain eligibility criteria, persons returning to the workplace (having been unemployed for over a year) may be able to avail of Revenue's Job Assist.  In this regard, the promoter may wish to contact the Departments of Social Protection at www.welfare.ie and Revenue at www.revenue.ie for further information.

According to departmental records the person concerned does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for invalidity pension.  However, entitlement to invalidity pension can only be fully determined on receipt of a completed application form.  To date no application has been received from the person concerned.  The person in question is currently in receipt of a disability allowance payment from my Department.

I am advised by FÁS that, as the individual in question had been claiming jobseeker's benefit for just over a year before joining CE, he was deemed eligible for one year's participation on the Part-time Integration Option, which is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for 1 year or more.  Generally, the Part-time Integration Option is for a maximum of 1 year.  FÁS has invited the individual concerned to contact the FÁS Employment Services Office, Government Buildings, Castlepark, Arklow to arrange an appointment with an Employment Services Officer to discuss further options that might be available to him.

This delineation reflects the working patterns that have traditionally applied in the labour market and particularly accorded with the usual experiences of persons who accessed benefit payments during periods of unemployment.  Increasingly in recent years the labour market has changed and attendance patterns and requirements have altered also; for example Sunday working has increased substantially when compared to former times.  Such developments, and other changes in working patterns and tenure, inform ongoing consideration of the jobseeker benefits system and its place in the current labour market.

Once a person satisfies these conditions, jobseeker's benefit is paid for the days that they are unemployed.  For each day of unemployment in the week (Monday to Saturday), the person is paid one-sixth of their weekly rate of entitlement.  The amount they are earning for the days they are working does not impact on their rate of jobseeker's benefit.

Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30m.The Deputies should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The average waiting time for new family income supplement (FIS) claims at the end of October is 20 weeks.  The waiting time for renewal FIS claims is currently between 10-11 weeks.  At the end of October, there were approximately 8,679 new FIS applications and approximately 5,113 renewal applications awaiting approval.The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.  The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times:Existing processes and procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;Priority is being given to renewal claims to preserve continuity of payment;The ongoing staffing requirement is being kept under review in light of the continued strong claim intake;Additional temporary staff have been recruited to help reduce the backlog;Overtime working is being applied where feasible;These measures are aimed at reducing the number of claims on hand and the average waiting time for a decision.

This became known as the WPP Conversion Process. The following two rules applied to this conversion process:If a participant was on a WPP for less than four months they could convert their post over to JobBridge for a total of six months;If a participant was on a WPP for more than four months they could convert their post over to JobBridge for a total of three months.In the case referred to, as the person in question was on a WPP placement for less than four months at the time of their application to participate in JobBridge they are therefore entitled to be on the JobBridge Scheme for six months. They are not entitled to a nine month internship as they had already been on a WPP placement with the same organisation.

For the purposes of one-parent family payment, there is no entitlement where earnings exceed a threshold of €425 gross per week.  Where earnings are less than €425, the first €146.50 is disregarded and half of the balance is assessed as means.  The rate of payment is then reduced accordingly.Each year, a review form is automatically posted to OFP clients to see if the client still meets all the conditions of the payment.  Both clients were issued with the review form, and both reported that their gross weekly earnings were greater than €425.  Their payments were then suspended.  However, where a person has income from employment with the Health Service Executive (HSE), or by a person approved by the HSE, as a home help, all such earnings are disregarded.  This disregard was not applied in these cases.Arrangements have now been made for the restoration of payment to both of the persons concerned.  The Department apologises for the upset caused as a result of the suspension of the payments concerned.  In order to avoid any future misinterpretation of the conditions of income as a home help, the guidelines for the scheme will shortly be updated and all relevant staff informed.

The programme assists by enhancing and developing a person's technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.The criteria for participating on community employment are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social protection payments.  There are two options under which community employment can be accessed.  In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people aged 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for a year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments. The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for three years or longer.  Certain groups, such as members of the traveller community, refugees and recovering drug misusers may be eligible for both options provided they are aged at least 18 years. Under certain conditions a spousal swap can be approved.  Those who are signing for credits or are receiving social welfare benefits from a different country are not eligible to participate on community employment.  Further detailed information is available on the FÁS website (www.fás.ie).

Up to now, the legislation provided for a 2 step process, first to the Health Services Executive (HSE) and, if still dissatisfied, to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.As part of that process, any appeals that have been submitted in recent weeks to the HSE are being transferred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. These appeals will be registered and acknowledged by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in due course.  In this case, I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an appeal for SWA for the person concerned has not yet been registered. The Chief Appeals Officer has assured me that all appropriate measures are being taken to address the smooth transfer of SWA appeals to her office.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

The timescale for determining applications for rent and mortgage interest supplements is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements, information from landlords, lending institutions etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.The provision of a prompt service is a major objective; however this has to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated. While certain cases may take more time to process than others, overall, I am satisfied that every effort is being made to decide rent and mortgage interest supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner.

I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that 1,046 carer's allowance appeals were received in 2008, 1,977 in 2009, 2,969 in 2010 and 1,838 appeals have been received in 2011 (to 31 October 2011).During 2008 a total 750 appeals were determined of which 421 (56%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.  The relevant figures for 2009 are 1,185 appeals determined of which 637 (53%) had a successful outcome.  The relevant figures for 2010 are 2,145 were determined of which 1,215 (56%) has a successful outcome for the appellant.  The figure for 2011 are 2,602 appeals determined of which 1,288 (49.5%) had a successful outcome.While roughly 53% of the combined totals (3,561) had a successful outcome for appellants, almost half of these decisions (1,906) were in fact revised decisions made by deciding officers in the carer's allowance section of the Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose primarily as a result of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his /her claim.  In such cases an appeals officer's decision was not necessary.Of the 487 carers appeals determined by an appeals officer in 2008, 158 were allowed or partially allowed (32%) while in 2009 the relevant number allowed by Appeals Officers was 277 (33%); the relevant figure for 2010 was 520 allowed (35.64%); and, for 2011, 700 (34.76%).

Review projects for State pension (contributory) and invalidity pension recipients are currently being undertaken. It is the Department's policy to pursue the full recovery of all overpayments identified in these control activities in accordance with its debt recovery guidelines, and to put in place a debt recovery plan by agreement with the person concerned at a rate of repayment which does not cause them undue financial hardship.  The Department is currently dealing with almost 400 cases where overpayments have been identified.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.When a customer makes an application for any social welfare payment they are provided with a detailed information booklet in addition to the application form. This booklet clearly outlines the conditions for eligibility for the particular scheme. The application form further outlines these conditions and requires the applicant to sign a declaration to the effect that they will notify the Department if they no longer fulfil those conditions or if their means or circumstances change in a manner which would affect their payment.In addition, when a claim is awarded, a decision letter is issued to the customer which outlines the fact that they are required to notify the Department of any changes in their means or circumstances which may affect their payment.  When a claim is reviewed at a later date, the customer is again asked about their means and circumstances and informed that they must notify the Department of any changes.Where, following a review of a claim in payment, it is confirmed that the customer had been receiving a payment to which they were not entitled, or were receiving a payment at a higher rate than they were entitled, a deciding officer makes a revised decision on the entitlement. Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case. This can result in the assessment of an overpayment.Fraud overpayment cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status. Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or third party error or departmental error. In the case of customer error, the customer had not fully disclosed their full means or circumstances, but the deciding officer decides it was an error or oversight by the customer, not wilful concealment or fraud.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.The Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments arising as a result of suspected fraud or error. Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming. Debt holders should be aware that a debt owing to my Department will remain on their records until fully recovered. This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension. Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department has a claim on any estate remaining. Persons who have a debt and who are not longer dependent on social welfare are required to repay this debt as quickly as possible. The Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments including the initiation of civil proceedings where appropriate.The Deputy should note that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the system.  Given this enhanced approach, the Department plans to increase the level of debt recovery by reviewing the overall approach, particularly in the context of overpayments that have arisen from suspected social welfare fraud.  While the details, including in particular legal requirements, will have to be examined closely, a range of options will be explored under this initiative with a view to both minimising overpayments and increasing recoveries. The consideration of all options in these areas has of course to be balanced, clearly taking into account the core income support and social inclusion purpose of social protection payments.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	556	In the period since May 2009, in excess of 900 staff have been assigned to my Department to fill critical vacancies and additional posts that were approved to deal with the significant increase in claims for the various schemes operated by the Department.  The staffing needs of the Department are continuously reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising. While assignments were not made in the precise ratio of the increase in applications for individual payment type, I can assure the Deputy that senior managers ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.The Department continues to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition to sourcing all available staff, the Department is involved in a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which applications for the various schemes are processed.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	557	Processing times vary across schemes because of the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria. For example, means assessments are required for all social assistance schemes, medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions. In the case of insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the Department.  These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  Since May 2008, through redeployment and the allocation of additional posts, some 900 staff have been assigned to the Department to fill critical vacancies and deal with the increased volume of claims.Over the past ten years the Department has been involved in a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes claims.  The project involves the development of new IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  This new system is up and running in Child Benefit, State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Transition), State Pension (Non-Contributory), Widow's, Widower's and Civil Partnership Pensions, Bereavement Grant, Domiciliary Care, Free Travel and  Household Benefits.  In May 2011, the system was implemented for Invalidity Pensions and Carer's Allowance Scheme in August 2011.   It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to customers on these schemes, in line with efficiencies gained in the other schemes where the initiative has already been implemented.It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.

In the case of means tested social assistance schemes, the vast majority of claimants are means tested only once.  In a small number of cases, a second means test may be required if they apply for basic supplementary welfare allowance or rent/mortgage interest supplement.Two important projects are currently underway which will enhance the delivery of means tested payments.  The objective of the first project is to facilitate the capture and storage of means information and the calculation of customer means across social assistance schemes has been completed and is currently being rolled out.One of the benefits of this project is that the Department will, where appropriate, be able to re-use means information already held which in turn will provide better customer service by reducing the need for different parts of the Department to request information from the applicant.  Other benefits of this project include: achieving qualitative and quantitative improvements in productivity; achieving value for money in the use of resources; implementing secure control processes; providing better management information; allowing for the future introduction of mobile working to facilitate the electronic capture of data at time of investigation; and placing the Department  in a position to anticipate and respond to changing business demands e.g. additional means factors, changes to scheme rules etc.The second project involves the integration of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) into the Department. This will result in a more coordinated approach to the provision of service to the public. This will create opportunities to remove duplication of work, including in the area of means assessment.

The detailed administration of the schemes, the processing of applications and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes are the responsibility of the local authority in the first instance.  As such, each local authority is responsible for the assessment and appraisal of all new voluntary sector projects and ensuring that they are advanced through the planning, procurement and implementation phases in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Works Management Framework for publicly funded capital projects.

There are also environmental and economic benefits that can accrue from reducing the demand for water abstraction at source and the subsequent and expensive treatment of raw water for human consumption.  Large-scale rainwater harvesting systems are already in use by some schools, factories and other buildings and are increasingly being incorporated into new developments.Retro-fitting a rainwater harvesting system could require the installation of an attic storage tank and the re-routing and upgrading of plumbing and, therefore, could be expensive.  Any plumbing system based on rainwater collection may contain traces of atmospheric and environmental pollutants, along with animal and bird faecal matter.  It is essential, therefore, that there is no cross connection between any pipe, fitting or appliance carrying non-potable water and pipes carrying potable water in order to avoid potentially serious issues for public health and risk of cross-contamination of the public water supply. It is essential that any installer is competent in safeguarding potable water supplies within a mixed pipe system and consumers installing such systems should be aware of the on-going operational and maintenance requirements.Many local authorities provide advice on their websites regarding water conservation and the efficient use of water.  Some local authorities, for example Dublin City Council, have arrangements in place whereby water butts for household use can be purchased directly from the authority.The introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints and, in so far as the funds administered by my Department are concerned, there are currently no plans to introduce a scheme of grant aid for the installation of rainwater harvesting systems.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in making the rating system fairer and equitable for ratepayers.  Following completion of the revaluation programme, there is expected to be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Valuation Act.The Commissioner of Valuation is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme to all rating authorities within a shorter timeframe.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012. The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012.  The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties in the State potentially liable to the household charge.  As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.  The charge will be collected centrally on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  It is intended that the proceeds from the household charge will be paid into the Local Government Fund and will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General-Purpose Grants.  The legislation to underpin the household charge will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.

Paragraph (2) of the Regulation effectively ensures that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is separated or divorced.The Regulation is worded in such a way that once there is a Deed of Separation in place, this aspect of eligibility for social housing support can be determined.  There is no need therefore to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  I consider that this provision is reasonable in most cases.  I acknowledge, however, that situations may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. My Department is keeping the social housing assessment provisions under ongoing review and in this context will consider what wider discretion might be given to housing authorities to address the individually difficult and complex cases which may present to them.

The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders/policy holders with their funds in credit institutions and insurance undertakings. Under the Dormant Accounts Amendment (2011) Bill, the right to reclaim funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund will remain unchanged.  Any change would have significant legal and constitutional, including property rights, implications.

In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Dormant Accounts Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes. Government Departments and agencies must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation, in the same way as with any other funding programmes. However, this is a matter I am prepared to keep under review, particularly in the context of any improvement to the budgetary situation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of September 2011 the transfers to the DAF have totalled some €626.69m, which includes interest earned of some €35.63m.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately €219.87m. The net value of the Dormant Accounts Fund (uncommitted funds) is €81.81m.A summary of the current status of the DAF is available on my Department website.  This provides a profile of the Fund showing yearly inflows, reclaims, disbursements, etc, from 2003 to the end of September 2011.  In 2010 disbursements from the fund totalled €20.267m; the following table sets out details in this regard, including the relevant Departments and agencies involved.  The disbursements from January 2011 to the end of September 2011 are €0.818m; however, it is not appropriate to compare the 2011 figure to the 2010 figure, as end of year accounting procedures have yet to be completed in respect of all expenditure in 2011. While the expenditure in 2011 is likely to be significantly down on 2010 levels, this reflects the severe budgetary situation and is not related to the existence of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.Accounts Fund 2010Disbursements2010Pobal (Formerly ADM, Service provider and agent of the Dormant Accounts Board)€875,000Dept.

I have discussed the UK model with a delegation from the Dormant Accounts Board recently.  That model enables banks, Buildings Societies and so on, to pass this money, on a voluntary basis, to the Big Lottery Fund for distribution for social and environmental purposes, while also retaining the right of reclaim to account holders.While the mechanism for distribution is different between our jurisdictions, the overall thrust of the schemes is the same. There is nothing to suggest that one is better than the other; indeed more than a quarter of a billion Euros has been disbursed from the Fund here since it was set up in 2003. Accordingly, I see no reason to change the administrative procedures for the roll out of Dormant Accounts Funds as provided for in existing and proposed Dormant Accounts legislation.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	582	I can inform the Deputy that based on information that is readily available from the Garda Authorities the number of vetting application on hand at the start of November was in the region of 45,000 to 50,000.  In relation to providing the Deputy with information pertaining to when those applications were received, I am further informed that this would take an inordinate amount of time to determine and could not be justified given the current demands on the resources of the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).However, the Deputy may wish to know that the current average processing time for vetting applications now stands at 5 weeks approximately.  This processing time can, nevertheless, be affected by seasonal fluctuations or the necessity to seek further information on particular applications which may result in the processing time exceeding the present average of 5 weeks.As I have said previously, I am very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible. Since becoming Minister I have taken a number of measures which have significantly reduced the time taken for the processing of vetting applications. The sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was obtained to retain the services of 10 temporary employees working in the GCVU.  Sanction was also obtained to engage an additional 10 temporary employees and these are now working in the GCVU.  A further initiative to provide internships through the National Internship Scheme, "Job Bridge", under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection, is also currently under way.  All of this should have a further positive impact on processing times.

The policing plan will also be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.It is the case that, as with every other public sector organisation, the Garda Síochána is going to have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner has therefore quite properly been reviewing all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures.The purpose of the review is to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements and to maintain Garda frontline services to the greatest extent possible — which is consistent with Government policy.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	589	As I have said previously annual savings in respect of utilities, security duty allowances and maintenance amount to approximately €1.3 million per annum in respect of the four closures.  In relation to Columb Barracks Mullingar these savings amount to approximately €0.4 million based on the most recent figures available.  In addition to the cost of utilities each barracks requires a security detail and additional further personnel are tied up on purely administrative duties connected to the management of the particular barracks.  Because maintaining barrack security can require around the clock cover, a much larger pool of personnel is required.  Therefore, several hundred additional man years will become available for operational duties.  At a minimum, the value of this efficiency gain across the four locations will exceed €5 million per year.The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.  This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.

The Department will, in the coming weeks, also be contacting the local authorities and county development boards to establish the full extent of any particular planning conditions that might apply and the nature of developments that will be facilitated on these sites.I have asked to be kept fully appraised of progress with these consultations and will if necessary become directly involved myself.  If any local group thought it useful to meet with me or my officials regarding the future use to which the barracks might be put I will be pleased to make the necessary arrangements.

In the case of the rank of Corporal, I have sanctioned promotions to bring the current strength to 60% of the established strength as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4.  The actual number of promotions that arise in each of the Army Reserve, the Reserve Defence Force Training Authority and the Naval Service Reserve as a result of the sanction of 10 October, and based on the strength numbers at 30 September 2011, are set out in the attached tabular statement.It is possible that a limited number of consequential promotion opportunities may also arise.  These will be identified once promotion plans for each of the Army Reserve, the Reserve Defence Force Training Authority and the Naval Service Reserve have been prepared by the Military Authorities.  Additionally, further promotional opportunities may arise where it is shown that there is any further reduction in current strength figures which would reduce the strength below 70% (60% in the case of Corporals) of the established strength for the Reserve Defence Force.  This matter will be kept under review in the context of the ongoing Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force and the outcome of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.Lt ColCmdtCaptLtTotal OfficersS MBQMSCSCQMSSGTCPLTotal NCOsPTESCADETSTotalArmy Res Established Strength313027427768418181061338381,7232,836577209,292Army Res Actual Strength as of 30 Sept 2011382170280535121481795828881,6562,91605,107% Actual v Established Strength100636210178%67787659695258%51—55%70% of established strength29119219413137493587*1034———Total Officer PromotionsTotal NCO PromotionsTotal PromotionsActual No. of Promotions to level of 70%0922311145**146166——197*60% to apply to rank of Cpl**60% to apply to rank of CplLt ColCmdtCaptLtTotal OfficersS MBQMSCSCQMSSGTCPLTotal NCOsPTESCADETSTotalRDFTA Non Int Established Strength141712310321511320055RDFTA Actual Strength at 30 Sept 20110486181011100130031% Actual v Established Strength01004760078%100—335067041%0056%70% of established strength13121102111*700—Total Officer PromotionsTotal NCO PromotionsTotal PromotionsActual No. of promotions to level of 70%104—5——101790014*60% to apply to rank of CplLt ColCmdtCaptLtTotal OfficersS MBQMSCSCQMSSGTCPLTotal NCOsPTESCADETSTotalNaval Res Established Strength0428032004122448882800400Naval Res Actual Strength as of 30 Sept 20110310720031001030531510224% Actual v Established Strength—7536—62——2500426360%54—56%70% of established strength03200003817*29———Total Officer PromotionsTotal NCO PromotionsTotal PromotionsActual No. of Promotions to level of 70%——10—10———87**015——25*60% to apply to rank of Cpl**60% to apply to rank of Cpl

The CFP sets down the rules and regulations for the management and conservation of all fish stocks both those subject to quota restrictions covering both inshore and off shore fishing grounds and inshore stocks, many of which are not subject to quota.The EU Commission's proposal for a  reformed CFP extends, to 2022, the right for Member States to restrict access in a zone within 12 nautical miles of the coastline as is currently in place.  These restrictions have reduced fishing pressure in the 6 and 12 miles zones and have provided a level of protection against increased fishing effort from other Member States within the zone.I am not in favour of differentiating between our inshore fleet and the rest of the fishing fleet for quota management purposes.  I do not support the Commission's proposal to establish a mandatory Transferable Fishing Concessions (quotas) for vessels above 12 metres in length and as such I do not accept its approach to a differentiation of the small inshore fleet, in this regard.  I will be seeking additional support for the inshore sector in the context of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is an appropriate funding provision  to support the inshore fleet in particular in the effective management and conservation of inshore stocks in areas such as technical measures such as v notching lobster, environmental management, support and certification and safety.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The nursing home in question was established in 1959 and  there are 80 residents currently at the facility. There is also a day centre at the front of the main building providing a service to older persons from the local community.The HSE completed a survey of the physical infrastructure, mechanical services installations and water & drainage services at the Unit and found substantial issues and deficits in these areas.   It is estimated that it would cost almost €3 million to carry out the essential works to address these issues. However these works would not ensure compliance with National Quality Standards.  On that basis, the HSE decided to close St Brigid's and transfer the majority  of services to the new modern purpose built unit at Hollybrook  Community Nursing Unit at Inchicore.     The new CNU at Inchicore has a total capacity of 50 beds.  It has not been opened to date due to the current constraints on staffing.As capacity of the new CNU is less than that at St Brigid's the proposal also envisages that some staff and residents will transfer to other public units.  This will provide the HSE with an opportunity to reopen beds that are closed at these facilities.  Selection of an alternative placement for residents will be informed by the medical and care needs of each resident as evaluated by clinical staff.   It is important to emphasise that no resident will be placed in a more costly financial position because of the move.The day-care services at St. Brigid's are used by approximately 18 people daily from Monday to Friday.   Part of the relocation plan will include the placement of these clients in alternative day centres suitable for their needs in their local areas.  Ongoing consultation will continue to take place with residents, their families, staff, representative organisations and public representatives.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 228, inclusive, together.The Government intends to publish a framework for the development of smaller hospitals, which will set out the way these hospitals provide services to patients and how they work within their regional hospital networks.  The framework and its implementation is a priority of the Government.  In developing the framework, the Government is clear that:there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewerno acute hospital will close, andsafety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed, by providing  the right type of services in the right settings.We also need to take into account the individual circumstances of each hospital, to recognise the need for regional solutions and, within the excellent context provided by the HSE's clinical programmes, to encourage local innovation in response to service issues that arise locally or regionally. The best solutions will vary between regions and within the overall context referred to there is no question of a ‘one size fits all' approach.  I have already said that the reorganisation of our acute system must involve a two way transfer of services between the larger and smaller hospitals, and that as much of the less complex acute treatment should be provided as close to a patient's community as possible. I expect that the model for reassignment of services will be a dynamic one, capable of adapting to the changing needs of patients and the health service, nationally, regionally and locally, and the evolving nature of medical treatment and technology.In April this year, HIQA published its report on Mallow General Hospital. I am satisfied that the actions taken in relation to the hospital have addressed many of  the report's recommendations on the safety and quality of the hospital's services. This work has involved close consultation with senior clinicians, professionals and management.Detailed planning for the remaining changes, including changes to the emergency department necessarily involves significant local consultation, in line with the smaller hospitals framework. The involvement of GPs is an important element of the consultation process and the final proposals will be cleared with my office before formal implementation commences.The overall approach at Mallow is in line with my vision for smaller hospitals — that they are a vibrant element of local health services, providing treatment and care at the appropriate level of complexity to patients in their own areas. It confirms the crucial role that Mallow Hospital will play, as part of a wider network of acute hospitals across Cork and Kerry, in providing care for the population of North Cork.

Restrictions on the level of treatments available under the scheme were introduced in April 2010. Nevertheless the final expenditure in 2010 was €79.1 million which reflects the legacy from the more comprehensive scheme. The allocation for the Scheme in 2011 is also capped at €63 million. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has measures in place to ensure that patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs receive priority for treatment. In addition, a free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on the relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients. The HSE will continue to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources.
