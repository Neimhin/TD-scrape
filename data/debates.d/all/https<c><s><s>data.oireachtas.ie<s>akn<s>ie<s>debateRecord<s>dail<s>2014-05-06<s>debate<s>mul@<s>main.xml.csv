#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	EirGrid’s Grid25 national transmission grid development programme is vital for future socioeconomic progress in Ireland, regional development and to ensure consumers have access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy.  During the course of engagement by EirGrid in its recent public consultation processes a number of key concerns emerged. I have put in place a number of measures to deal with the immediate concerns related to the Grid West and Grid Link projects, while also addressing the generality of commentary on the need to improve stakeholder and community engagement on all future Grid25 projects. I have appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, to examine the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The panel of experts will decide the terms of reference for comprehensive, route-specific studies of full underground and overhead options for both projects. The panel has been asked to ensure the studies are complete, impartial, objective and comparable and will submit a report to me on these matters in due course. The two studies will consider environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The overhead and underground options will be published side by side in objective and comparable terms before consideration is given by EirGrid to the appropriate next steps for each of the projects. The panel has also been asked to consider what, if anything, it can do with regard to the North-South transmission line project. The panel has commenced its deliberations and I understand it expects to be in a position to announce the terms of reference for the Grid Link and Grid West transmission line projects soon. EirGrid published an interim report on the emerging themes from the Grid Link project consultation on 28 January. A copy of this report is available on EirGrid's website. All of the submissions which EirGrid received on the project are being examined by the EirGrid project team. I understand once a thorough and detailed examination of all the submissions has been completed, a report will be published on the project website and EirGrid will respond to all correspondence as quickly as possible.

There is great concern among all of the communities affected by the EirGrid projects. An issue constantly raised is that of health. I am concerned that this issue was not referred to in the Minister's reply in relation to the terms of reference. It is vitally important that health be a key factor in deliberations on the overground and underground options for the projects. The Minister might also update the House on the North-South interconnector in terms of the reviews to be carried out.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I understand the panel met as recently as last Friday. According to what I hear, I for one will be surprised if it does not issue its report on the terms of reference before next Friday. That is my expectation but I do not speak for the panel. With regard to health, the Deputy is correct that this matter has been a concern among residents and others during the recent public consultation phase. Responsibility in this regard does not repose in my Department. Health concerns about electromagnetic fields and non-ionising radiation are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The Department is engaging or has engaged expert assistance to study international developments in matters concerning non-ionising radiation. This will serve as an update on the report that the Deputy will be familiar with, namely, Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, which was produced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2007.

The project is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources while the health issue is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. This is a major project to be undertaken throughout the country. A considerable number of people will be affected by it either directly or indirectly. It behoves us all, therefore, to ensure that the Government as a whole examines it. The relevant sections in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should be working hand in glove with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure all aspects are dealt with. When a report is issued, people in the community will say it does not address certain issues. The questions of aesthetics, environmental impact, property value depreciation and health must all be borne in mind. Unless they are all covered in any committee's report, it will not be welcomed or assessed by the affected communities. The Minister might also address the North–South issue.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I can certainly assure the Deputy that the integrity of the process is being maintained by the expert panel under the chairmanship of the retired Honourable Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and that it is taking its responsibilities very seriously. Otherwise, it would have opined before now. I take the point that there must be optimum co-operation between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of the non-ionising radiation fear. This must draw on expert evidence that is absolutely up to date in this area. By contrast with Grid Link or Grid West, there is an immediate urgency about the North-South dimension in the context of an all-island electricity market and Northern Ireland's security of supply. It is a very small piece of interconnection infrastructure but it is of significant strategic importance. It extends for only 40 km approximately and runs from Meath to Tyrone. Its significance cannot be overstated. I cannot say anything further until I hear what former Supreme Court justice, Mrs. Catherine McGuinness has to say on the matter on behalf of her panel, but whatever she has to say will not detract from the fact of life that the infrastructure is urgent.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	Last year, the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Ed Davey, MP, and I signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation. The memorandum demonstrated our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain. An agreed programme of work was put in place, with work-streams across several areas. A key objective was to realise the potential for investment, job creation and growth. The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, were among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any intergovernmental agreement. Economic analysis conducted by my officials, with significant inputs from the ESRI and NewERA, indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading can deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the United Kingdom and would also be attractive to commercial investors and developers. However, progressing to an intergovernmental agreement on renewable energy trading would require any agreement to be designed in a manner that would work for both countries. In that regard, the UK side is not yet in a position to take certain key decisions on the quantity of energy to be procured, the regulatory treatment of Irish assets, the structure of subsidies to Irish developers and the resultant financial flows. Following further discussions since the summit between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron in early March, I am confirmed in the view that given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved and the outstanding decisions to be taken by the United Kingdom, delivery by 2020 of an intergovernmental agreement to facilitate energy export is not now a realistic proposition. While it has not been possible at this time to conclude an agreement, in the context of a European internal energy market, greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is inevitable in the post-2020 scenario. At national level, of course, the strong focus on our 2020 commitments is undiminished and consideration is being given to building on these commitments as we look towards 2030.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	We introduced the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill to curtail the export of renewable energy while, as a nation, we are so reliant on fossil fuels. From reports, it seems the British Government was not willing to pay the price. People are uncertain, as the Dáil and I are uncertain, as to whether the negotiations are about securing our energy needs or making the economic part a little more attractive for the Irish Government. Does the Minister believe fresh negotiations are the objective and that they would produce a better price deal than the first one, whatever it was? Renewable energy generation has to be a driving force if we are to attain energy security, but this has to be done in conjunction with local communities, which clearly was not being done. It must also be done by looking at every available option open to the Government in terms of renewable energy, given that there are other energy sources such as wind energy, biomass, tidal energy and so on. Is the Minister looking at these alternative sources, as well as waiting for a resumption of negotiations on a memorandum of understanding?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The contemplated wind export project in the midlands was a discrete and ring-fenced project that had nothing at all to do with our capacity to meet our domestic needs. We are on track to have 40% of our electricity generated from renewables by 2020.By any European standard, that is considered to be at the leading edge in terms of what any transmission system can accommodate. We remain satisfied that we will reach that target and all of the evidence shows that we will. It is not a case of being able to divert what might have happened in the midlands into an additional quantum of renewable energy generation on top of the 40%. A hugely complex technical study is under way to measure the capacity of the transmission system in terms of how much any transmission system can accommodate in terms of renewables. Therefore, that is not the concern. The projects were entirely separate.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	An awful lot of work is ongoing in this area. It is also an area in which there is much uncertainty. Pending publication of the Government's Green Paper on renewable energy and the debate on the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill, would it not make sense to introduce certainty by having a moratorium on planning for major wind farms? The companies are still negotiating leases and people are still nervous and concerned. Until we are clear on what our strategy is and the financial arrangements are, would it not make sense for us to introduce a moratorium on planning applications for major wind farms?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	At the outset the Deputy said reasonably that he was in favour of renewables to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and accelerate the departure from a reliance on fossil fuels to renewables. He cannot say this, on the one hand, and, on the other, say he wants a moratorium on development of renewables. The planning system is immensely rigorous. Everybody has known for a number of years about our 2020 mandatory targets and we are confident that we can deliver on them. I am not sure whether there is a great deal of uncertainty. There is, undoubtedly, genuine concern, but there is a good deal of deliberate misrepresentation. I am sorry about this because trade is the lifeblood of the economy. This is a small economy which depends on trade and selling things to other member states and countries to earn a living. We must continue to build trade links and open new markets for products and services from this economy. That is the way we generate wealth and create jobs.

However, technological developments in recent years have meant that the use of biomass has become very attractive, particularly convection. Has the Department considered reviewing the policy and refocusing it? While wind energy will always be an option, we could focus on the potential of biomass to help us to reach our targets.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I thank the Deputy for putting this question.I can confirm that we are very much looking at the biomass policy and apart from a couple of final meetings between the Minister, myself and the Department, I expect to be in a position to publish the strategy document by the end of this month. As we are meeting those involved in the industry all of the time, we will be consulting them about a body on which they will be represented and to which they can make comments on the policy produced. I answer in the affirmative that we are very much looking at increasing the contribution of biomass.  The Renewable Energy Directive, published in 2009, set a legally binding target of 16% of our energy requirements from renewable resources by 2020. We are committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources by that time. In that regard, our policy interventions are designed to incentivise the market to deliver the necessary renewable generation capacity. The choice of technology is a commercial decision but the renewable energy feed-in tariff, or REFIT, is the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland. To date, wind energy has proved to be the most commercial technology in the Irish market and provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of energy demand in the electricity sector was met from wind. Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon-free electricity system. To that end, the Minister published the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan earlier this year to establish the framework within which we can realise that potential.  Biomass will continue to be used in electricity generation and is likely to have a significant role in the heat and transport sectors. We will be publishing our strategy shortly which will set out our proposals to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass can make to achieving our 2020 targets. 
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I thank the Minister of State for his response and welcome the fact that a strategy is due to be published. I look forward to seeing it and examining its proposals. It is very important to consider electricity generation from biomass in the strategy. There is a project under way in Yorkshire at the moment to convert the largest coal-fired generating plant in Europe to biomass, which is technologically feasible and will contribute hugely to a reduction in carbon emissions. We should be looking at an adventurous programme like that, perhaps targeting Moneypoint for conversion to biomass, which would achieve the target of 40% renewable energy practically overnight. I hope the strategy will reflect that and will examine how that could be implemented. There is also huge potential for the development of a supply chain for the biomass industry and biomass power generation, particularly in the context of the amount of cut-out bog owned by Bord na Móna. Rather than using that for wind turbines, it could actually generate an indigenous industry delivering biomass for power generation and for export.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	A recent report produced by Rethink Pylons stated that converting Moneypoint from coal to biomass would meet our targets of 40% without the need to upgrade the grid or for further wind development. It argued that the conversion would cost €380 million, which is approximately 10% of the cost of upgrading the grid. The decision on the fuel type to be used would be a matter for the operator. However, there are a number of wider issues that would demand further consideration and deliberation. In summary, the amount of biomass needed to complete the conversion is 6.4 million tonnes on a continuous basis. Such an amount would not actually be available in Ireland and most of it would have to be imported. Such large scale levels of imports would call into question the environmental sustainability of such operations as well as raising transport and land-use issues. Any support for biomass at Moneypoint would require State aid approval. Were tariffs similar to those for biomass under REFIT 3 to apply, the cost of the public service obligation, PSO, would significantly exceed the cost of the 310 MW supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, without making any contribution to renewable heat targets. As I said earlier, we will have an opportunity in a few weeks time to debate these issues more fully.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	It is interesting that the plant in Yorkshire has signed contracts for the delivery of biomass from New England. It will be shipped there and transported inland to the plant. Moneypoint is on the coast, so one could ship biomass directly to that plant which would be significantly cheaper than what is happening in Yorkshire. There is also the potential to develop our own indigenous industry to supply biomass, as well as developing export growth in that regard. It would provide sustainable jobs without damaging local communities, thus allaying concerns about the use of industrial wind turbines. I look forward to seeing the introduction of the strategy. If the refit needs to be redesigned or tweaked we should start that work now. This is a way of achieving our targets without the amount of pain in evidence across the country at the moment.

I assure the Deputy that we want to increase the use of indigenous biomass on this island. I am happy to take on board the issues the Deputy has raised and will get an official response for him. When the plan is published we will have a full and proper debate on all the issues.

I know there is to be a whole-of-government report, but what negotiations and discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Social Protection on the sustainability of post offices?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community. The professionalism of the postmasters and An Post has served the network well down through the years and I do not see any reason this should not continue to be the case in the years ahead. I met with members of the Irish Postmasters' Union on 24 March and we had a useful and wide-ranging discussion on their concerns about the future of the post office network. I have written to my Government colleagues, including the Department of Social Protection, to encourage them to consider what assistance their Departments might be able to give for the stimulation of new business for the post office network. I had committed to taking the issue of the provision of additional public sector business to the Cabinet committee on social policy. The committee had its initial consideration of the paper put to it at its meeting on 28 April and agreed to my proposal for a whole-of-government review of the scope for putting additional public services in the post offices. This will be undertaken over the coming months with the aim of a final report, based on the responses made by Departments, being made to the Cabinet committee in September.  I see a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of Government, financial and other services. Securing the future viability of the post office network in the longer term will entail the network continuing to modernise, as it is doing, to provide the services that its customers require. Any such developments would need to be subject to competition and public procurement requirements as appropriate.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I thank the Minister for his reply. Is it not time that we looked at the fundamental governance of An Post and the memorandum establishing the company? The ESB has a public service obligation to maintain the electricity network to every community in the country. We talk about maintaining post offices and the fact that the post office network is vital to communities but apart from the network, post offices also have the public's trust. It is time that the memorandum of understanding establishing An Post was changed to state that it has to maintain post office networks the length and breadth of the country. As a commercial semi-State body, the emphasis of An Post would change dramatically if it was obliged by legislation or other statutory means to maintain the post office network. In that case, An Post would vigorously go after business to ensure that the network was maintained. The other issue concerns State contracts including, most recently, the provision of driving licences. It must be looked at to ensure that An Post can tender for such projects.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The problem is that An Post's mandate is that of a commercial State company. It is not always possible to reconcile that with a mandate to shore up the post office network. The post office network is a combination of private enterprises which are subject to EU competition and procurement law. Deputy Moynihan is correct that there is a dilemma here. The dilemma is best highlighted in the context of the point he raises about the social welfare contract, which is worth approximately €58 million to the postal network. The dilemma is how to migrate the contract to electronic transfer of funds and protect the incomes of postmasters. While I understand fully why postmasters would want to protect their incomes, I also appreciate why there is an imperative from the point of view of the Department of Social Protection to make savings in the delivery of its services wherever possible. For example, the average income from the social welfare contract for postmasters, who might well have other business, was €37,000 per annum at the height of the boom in 2004. Last year, the average was €68,000 per annum. That is because the social welfare contract provides for a fee per transaction coupled with the explosion in unemployment since the economic crash. Clearly, incomes significantly increased on foot of the fee per transaction arrangement. I have made the points Deputy Moynihan makes to An Post's senior management, who have pointed out to me that they had to take €70 million out of payroll costs and €30 million out of non-payroll costs in the same period that the incomes of postmasters increased significantly for the reasons I have outlined. We must reconcile the dilemma between seeking to protect the incomes of postmasters and the need for the Department of Social Protection to efficiently and most effectively deliver its service to its clients.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	As a society, we must make up our minds as to whether we want to maintain the post office network as it is. We have seen how communities that lose their post offices very quickly lose other services. An Post is a semi-State body to the same extent as the ESB, which is obliged to provide a service in every community. We must look at An Post. I have looked genuinely at this matter in a whole raft of ways. We can add services. Post offices have financial services, the social welfare contract and other things, which is all very well and good for those offices which are up and running. However, we must get down and deep into the smaller communities which are losing post offices, including Freemount and Rathcoole in the recent past. We must change the memorandum of understanding to provide that An Post has a legal obligation to ensure that the network is maintained and go after the business then.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	In fairness to An Post and postmasters, they have grown their businesses in recent years and continue to do so. If one looks at the withdrawal of banking services from many villages and towns, it appears that retail banking has gone out of fashion as far as the senior management and boards of banks are concerned. Post offices have stepped in. One of the things I have put to the Cabinet sub-committee is that the Irish Postmasters Union might productively explore an arrangement with the Irish League of Credit Unions to establish a basic or standard bank account.I have had discussions with the Minister for Finance on this point and do not think we should exaggerate. The Government has no plans to close post offices. I have given the figures in the House before. Some 197 post offices were closed between 2006 and 2010. Since 2010, 17 have been closed. There is no intention on the part of the Government to wantonly close post offices, but there is a necessity for the House to have clarity on the role of An Post. I appreciate the immensely valuable role the post office network plays at village and community level, as the Deputy argues. The role of the postman or postwoman is far wider than just delivering the post. The mandate which has been given to An Post is that it is a commercial State company which brings with it certain realities at a time of e-substitution and when it has lost 30% of its core mail business in the past five years. These realities must be taken into account.

I explain that the Minister and the Department are doing a lot of work, much of which is good. However, people say to me that broadband is as essential in rural areas as rural electrification was. They want to know specifically when it will happen and want the Minister to give a specific timescale.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I agree with the Deputy that it is unacceptable that in urban Ireland quality broadband connectivity competes with anything available in any city in Europe but large tracts of rural Ireland have access to a very basic service. The Government’s national broadband plan which I published in August aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment and by a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest. On 25 April I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as a foundation for future-proofed broadband services as part of the State's intervention under the national broadband plan. This commitment is a clear expression of the Government’s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. The fibre build-out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services. I have published a county by county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. The list contains over 1,000 rural communities and is available on my Department's website. This is an indicative list only and subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process under way. Intensive design work is ongoing in my Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping process which will identify those areas that require intervention. The proposed State intervention under the national broadband plan represents a significant infrastructural project. Delivery of the fibre network will require careful planning and take time. EU state aid clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015, with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network at the end of that year.

I explained to him previously the frustration felt by a person who is running a home industry, but has to travel around in a car with an iPad to try to get reception. That is no way to run a business. It would be beneficial for the Department and for people seeking information if the Minister could tell us whether it would be possible for a web page to be set up or for an office to be set up at which people with extremely poor Internet access could register their telephone numbers and addresses for that information to be communicated to the Department. The Department could then provide these people with a response telling them by what date they will have access and the minimum speed of access they can expect to have by that date. Such an initiative would, at least, let them know real progress is being made and they would have a definite date by which they could plan to develop their business. Would that be possible?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	Recently, the Deputy and other colleagues supported a Bill in the House that facilitates the ESB entering into a joint venture with a leading telecommunications operator to use its supply infrastructure to roll out fibre to parts of rural Ireland that could never have hoped to access it. This arrangement is being concluded and the preferred company selected following the submission of expressions of interest is Vodafone. The new venture will be a 50:50 joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone, the purpose of which is to alleviate at least some of Deputy Colreavy's heartache. I expect an announcement on this in the near future. In fairness to the commercial sector, it must be acknowledged that this sector is putting €2 billion into investment into this area. For example, Eircom has put in an additional €400 million to ensure it exceeds provision to 1.4 million premises, as distinct from the 1.1 million premises pledged as recently as two years ago. Therefore, there is significant commercial investment, the separate ESB-joint venture and the mapping exercise in which we are engaged in order to get State aid approval for us to build out the fibre network.

However, there is little certainty for people living outside of our towns and villages regarding when they can expect action will happen. Also, there is no communication protocol on this issue, even in regard to keeping the Department informed of the situation. Mention was made of the gap analysis. People are identifying the gaps that exist and they know where they are.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I would like to think the website does give that information. I have explained the process we must go through. There is no easy telephone solution for a small business in Dromahair that may have poor quality broadband. Without the network being available, there is no short-term solution. There are some parts of Ireland where, for topographical reasons, it is very difficult to deal with this phenomenon. That is the reason we are going for a fibre roll-out. Fibre is the Rolls Royce of connectivity. This end-to-end solution will facilitate even the most remote parts of the country, by virtue of the fact there may be alternative wireless solutions once the fibre is close by. I hope work will start on the ESB joint venture at the end of this year.Following the mapping exercise, public procurement tendering and so on, I hope the European Union will permit us to start work on the direct State intervention, with whatever contractors are chosen, by the end of 2015.

Has the Minister had discussions with that Department on this issue? Does he have concerns about the extension of a licence to a company which appears not to be sufficiently well organised to keep within the timeline it negotiated with the Department?

Other than statutory trans-boundary consultation, the Irish authorities have no role in the consideration of such applications.  On the broader issue of unconventional gas exploration, officials in my Department have had regular contacts with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in regard to onshore exploration authorisations in the two jurisdictions. These contacts have facilitated an exchange of information on the nature of activities that have been licensed and their associated timelines. There has also been a sharing of information on the regulatory processes that apply in each jurisdiction. The focus of these engagements has been on information sharing, not on seeking to agree a joint North-South policy. In the case that a project in either jurisdiction were to advance to the exploration drilling stage, it would be subject to the regulatory processes that pertain in that jurisdiction. However, the environmental consideration of any proposed project in either jurisdiction will be subject to EU environmental legislation, including the provisions relating to consultation across borders where there could be a potential negative environmental impact in a neighbouring jurisdiction. Both the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland, GSNI, are members of the steering group overseeing the Environmental Protection Agency's comprehensive study of the environmental impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction in Ireland.

Unfortunately, poisoned water and air do not stop at any border and, as such, decisions made in the Six Counties will impact on people living in the Twenty-six Counties. Is the Minister of State aware that the British Government is considering the introduction of legislation which will make it permissible to give approval to companies to drill under properties without obtaining the consent of their owners? Will we be following the example of the British Government in this regard or will we reserve for Irish people the right to withhold consent to drill under their lands or properties, which is what the authorities in Britain seem intent on doing, in order to facilitate a fracking industry in this country?
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I am not aware of what the British Government intends to do in this regard, no more than the Deputy or his party is. Such decisions are a matter for that government. As I said, we are involved in a joint North-South study to identify all of the issues involved. It is important, too, that we be fully up to date with all of the international research. The objective of our research is to establish whether shale gas exploration involving the using of fracking can be carried out in a manner that does not cause significant environmental pollution, identify all possible risks associated with the fracking technique, ascertain whether these risks are manageable and identify best practice in environmental protection in the use of hydraulic fracturing for the exploration and extraction of gas. In November last year the EPA, assisted by a steering committee comprising, among others, the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, launched a call for research tenders. Some six tenders were received from approximately 45 academic consultancies and other bodies. Assessment of these tenders is nearing completion and it is expected that a successful bidder will be appointed shortly. Following the engagement of the relevant experts, a study will be compiled. It is anticipated that this process will take up to two years and that the potential publication date will be some time in 2016. Nothing will happen on this part of the island until the study has been completed and fully debated.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I am somewhat shocked that the Minister of State is not aware of what is happening in Britain in respect of fracking. The matter features prominently in today's edition of The Guardian which indicates that 45,000 British citizens have joined legal moves to stop their government from changing trespass laws. I presume the Minister of State is also not aware of what is happening in America, but he should note that what happens outside the State in the context of fracking is important. In that context, some serious and independent reports were commissioned in the United States which highlighted the danger of fracking, not just in terms of water quality but also with regard to air quality. Has the Minister of State analysed these reports?
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I thank the Deputy for tabling her question. I wish to make it clear that I have not read today's edition of The Guardian. Unlike her, I have not had the time to do so. Now that she has brought the relevant article to my attention, however, I will certainly read it. I reassure her that I read everything I can find about developments relating to fracking. I visited America recently and witnessed the process of fracking in an urban environment in the state of Texas. The fracking was taking place approximately 200 yards from a large housing estate. During my visit I made it my business to meet representatives of the US Environmental Protection Agency. I also met one of the authors of the report, in respect of which preliminary judgments have been made. Like the Deputy, I am deeply concerned about the process of fracking. We want to ensure we get the science right and that we know exactly what is happening. I have the same concerns as everyone else about the technology and chemicals used - I am particularly worried about whether some of the chemical used may be carcinogenic - the protection of water tables, etc. All of the issues to which I refer lie at the heart of the Government's policy which is to ensure full academic research is carried out of the countries in which fracking has been banned and those in which it is legal. The Government's policy is also to take account of what the European Union has to state about fracking. I am deeply concerned about the beauty of the landscape in County Leitrim, County Fermanagh and elsewhere being affected by the impact of fracking. These issues are of as much concern to me and my Department as they are to the Deputy.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	There is something of a contradiction in what the Minister of State has just said. While I do not in any way doubt his sincerity, there is a conflict between the words he used and the actions the Government has taken in allowing this process to continue. The Big Oil, Bad Air report which relates to the state of Texas and which was commissioned by a Pulitzer prize-winning team highlights some serious evidence not only in respect of water quality but also air quality. It indicates that the wells, compressor stations and various other items of infrastructure for fracking are emitting industrial-sized air pollutants into the atmosphere. I refer to volatile organic compounds such as benzine which can cause cancer, hydrogen sulfide and other very dangerous substances which are having a severe impact on the population of Texas. Examining the position of countries such as France which have outlawed this practice would be worthwhile. We should take our lead from such countries. There is no need to waste time in waiting for research when information outlining the huge environmental consequences which might arise should we go further down this road is already available.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	On the other side of the argument is the fact that fracking or unconventional gas extraction has absolutely transformed the American economy and that the country has become an exporter, rather than an importer, of energy. The fundamental question concerns what process, if any, the Government is allowing. The answer is absolutely none. A decision was made in the February before we took office by the previous Administration which granted three companies onshore licensing options. Notwithstanding the fact that these options were granted by the Fianna Fáil Government, it did not allow the companies to commence fracking which is not allowed in this country. The scientific survey is being conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Until it is finalised and to hand, there is absolutely no way we will consider any new application or fracking will commence. I reject any implication to the contrary, although perhaps the Deputy did not intend to imply that there was. We are not in favour of any activity that would breach significant environmental protections that we need or any European Union environmental law or legislation. There is an advice note from the European Union on fracking. I reassure everyone that until the report is to hand, there will be no step forward in any respect. When it is to hand, it will be fully and properly debated in the House.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	In fairness, the Minister of State has been very strong in his response. I appreciate this and hope it will not come back to haunt him. Will he comment on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, under way in the European Union which gives special rights to companies? A report by Corporate Europe Observatory and other groups states the partnership is being used to stymie governments in preventing fracking, for example. Regardless of the Government's aspirations to protect Irish citizens from fracking, under the TTIP, fracking companies could overrule the Government, argue that their investments and future profits were being adversely affected and take action against the State. In that sense, how can we be reassured in this matter? Has the Minister of State examined the TTIP in this context?

As well as conducting research on the scientific data, will the EPA or the company engaged by it to carry out the research meet representatives of communities in other jurisdictions who have said they were damaged by fracking?
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	I stand to be corrected, but on the latter point, as I understand it, submissions were sought by the EPA before anything happened. I understand the agency has received thousands of submissions, all of which are being gone through. There has been total transparency and total involvement. The views expressed to the EPA will obviously have to be considered. Reference was made to community involvement. Even if a new Government were to take office tomorrow and state it would change all of this, it could not change the planning laws. There must be a full, transparent and accountable planning process, but we are not allowing it to commence at this stage. Until the report is to hand, there will be no developments whatsoever in this area.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I launched the Eircode brand for a national postcode system on 28 April. In spring 2015, every Irish address will get a unique code, which will bring many benefits to the daily lives of people, householders and businesses. Since a contract to deliver the project was signed with Capita, considerable progress has been made on design and engagement with public and private sector stakeholders who see significant benefits and opportunities arising from the introduction of Eircodes. An Post has been actively involved in the design process for the national postcode system and is committed to using the new Eircodes, which will be fully integrated with An Post's mails sortation systems. Any integration cost will be part of An Post's overall capital expenditure programme. An Post's mails integration costs are not included in the predicted €26 million Exchequer cost of introducing a national postcode system. At least half of this €26 million investment will go towards the improvement of public service databases, bringing considerable long-term efficiencies and savings in the delivery of public services. Regarding An Post's costs, the CEO has stated that it will cost €1 million to install new software in the four mails sortation centres. The benefits of Eircodes to An Post will significantly outweigh any cost arising from their implementation. The national postcode system will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector and provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved marketing capabilities. Parcel and mail deliveries from An Post and other delivery and logistics companies will be able to use the new postcode system to identify quickly the location of a single house set in the countryside or an apartment in a newly developed multi-storey. The Eircode will integrate with GPS devices and smartphones and can be easily mapped onto any defined national boundary set, such as counties, electoral districts and small areas.

Much of the information would have been available had we received a copy of the correspondence from the European Commission in respect of the procurement process for the national postcode system. Could that correspondence be made available?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	The process, which was a competitive dialogue, was entirely open. Capita was selected on the basis that it was the preferred bidder. Many forecast that An Post would be selected. It was not in the event. Capita has a track record in this general area. It employs approximately 1,000 people in Ireland. At a public presentation last week or the previous week - I cannot recall which - it set out its stall in front of stakeholders and the media and took questions about the unique identifier system that would be implemented for Ireland. We are coming late to the party, so to speak. We are the only country in the OECD that does not have a postcode system. The new system brings the advantage of being able to avail of the latest technologies. As a result, we will have a world leading unique identifier system, established in a country where some 35% of addresses are not unique. The business community has been mounting growing pressure on the Department and me during the past year as regards what it views as the possibilities presenting in the era of digital technology and digital enterprise. The community believes that this will grow business and jobs. An Post believes that it will add to its own bottom line.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	To limit the lottery possibilities, I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 129 together.During the course of engagement by EirGrid in its public consultation processes, and most recently in relation to the Grid Link project, on which 35,000 submissions were received, a number of key concerns emerged. This has necessitated considerable review and reflection in order to determine the optimum approach needed to address those concerns that are valid, while at the same time ensuring adequate and effective electricity transmission capacity in the State. Arising from examination of the concerns expressed, I have put in place a number of measures to deal with the immediate concerns on the Grid West and Grid Link projects, while also addressing the generality of commentary on the need to improve stakeholder and community engagement on all Grid25 projects for the future.  I have appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by the Hon. Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, to examine the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The panel of experts will decide the terms of reference for comprehensive, route specific studies of fully underground and overhead options for both projects. They have been asked to ensure that the studies are complete, impartial, objective and comparable and will submit a report to me on these matters in due course. Both the overhead and underground options will be published side by side, in objective and comparable terms, before consideration is given by Eirgrid to the appropriate next steps for each of the projects. The panel has also been asked to consider what, if anything, it can do with regard to the North-South transmission line project. The panel has commenced its deliberations and I understand that the panel has had several meetings, most recently last Friday. I further understand that the panel expects to be in a position to announce the terms of reference for the panel itself, as well as the terms of reference for the Grid Link and Grid West transmission line projects, very soon. In the interests of completing its work in a timely manner, the panel does not consider it would be possible to accede to requests for meetings with third parties, given the likely volume of such requests. However, should anyone wish to submit material to the panel, they may do so by email to expertpanel@dcenr.ie. Additionally, I have asked the chairman of EirGrid to undertake a comprehensive assessment with a view to improvement of EirGrid’s community engagement processes and procedures, having regard to the significant public concerns raised on this issue. In that regard, EirGrid made an announcement on 28 March 2014 that it has initiated a thorough review of its consultation process to improve future public engagement; this review will include an external review of their processes. The overall review is expected to be completed by June and its findings will be published, including recommendations to improve future public engagement. EirGrid published an interim report on the emerging themes from the Grid Link project consultation on 28 January. A copy of this report is available on the EirGrid website. All of the submissions which EirGrid received on the project are being examined by the EirGrid project team. I understand that once a thorough and detailed examination of all the submissions has been completed, a report will be published on the project website, and EirGrid will respond to all correspondence as quickly as possible.

The expert panel would not be having these discussions except for the fact that the local community protested and spoke about their serious, valid concerns about what appeared to them to be a policy decision driving practice that did not take their rights into account. It is important that those in the community know that it is not just the companies' technical advice that is informing this inquiry and that their concerns, which have been outlined in great detail, are seriously addressed because unless specific concerns are answered, communities will continue to voice the same concerns. They need to be identified and answered, and the answers must be explicit.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I thank Deputy Colreavy but that is the purpose of public consultation. That was provided in the arrangements. We are talking about a plan that was settled on in 2006 so nobody can seriously suggest that they have been overtaken by its suddenness. The public consultation phase allowed for this element of participation by the public, and we are responding to that. The Deputy is correct. Valid considerations ought to be responded to and taken into account but as he is well aware, there is a great deal of nonsense out there as well and if it was not for the scale of misrepresentation, exaggeration and so on, it would be possible to more efficiently respond to this matter. The serious side of all this is that the country has to have an energy supply and there is no point in Deputy Colreavy complaining to me about bringing employment to Dromahair, under Ben Bulben's head and various other places in Sligo that I would dearly love to see employment go to if we do not have a reliable energy supply. There are only a few ways known to man so far in terms of how energy can be transmitted, and walking around waving placards at it will not cause the lights to go on or supply a local factory or plant that might locate in different parts of regional Ireland. In terms of the requirements of industry, energy, water and connectivity are the three big concerns today, and I cannot afford to lose sight of that. I am happy that the consultation process is a rigorous one. The planning arrangements are very rigorous. Every care has been taken by the State to ensure that nobody has advanced a valid apprehension that will not be genuinely tested but at the end of the day, the lights cannot be allowed go out. What do we do with the tourists when they arrive at Dublin Airport? Do we give them lanterns? We must maintain an energy system in this country that is fit for purpose.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	On "The "Saturday Night Show" last Saturday, the people of the country would have watched Declan and Annette Coyle talk movingly about their nine year old son, Alex, and their heartbreak and sense of bewilderment at the heartless decision to take the discretionary medical card from their son. They put on the table the entire supply of medical equipment required for Alex on a weekly basis. It was a cocktail of syringes, feeding pumps, nappies and medication. With dignity and pride they spoke about how they look after their son on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis. He has Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which is very rare. If anything captured the extraordinary scandal that has been going on in our health system for the past two years, that episode captured it. I have raised time and again with the Taoiseach the Government's decision to end discretionary medical cards and take them from very needy people. The Jack & Jill Children's Foundation has 300 such hard cases with very sick children, and its literature is now stating that the Government is torturing the parents of such children into submission. Is that what the Taoiseach and the Government is about? Since January 2012 I have raised case after case involving issues such as this one. It is scandalous, and it reflects badly on the Government's view of issues and its sense of priority.There are other cases. An older woman with breast cancer and secondaries who is €20 over the limit has had her medical card withdrawn, as has a man suffering from chronic depression who previously attempted suicide and is €5 over the limit. The longest surviving Irish patient of chronic myeloid leukaemia, James Mullen, who has had a medical card for 22 years only found out during a visit six months ago to his chemist that it had not been renewed. What is going on is extraordinary. The Taoiseach has denied that there was any change of policy. We now know, courtesy of the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, that there was. He is now questioning whether there ever was a legal basis for discretionary medical cards. That anybody would do this to such vulnerable children and adults is causing uproar and shock across the country.

Obviously, these are exceptionally sensitive cases. It should not be assumed that the Government is out to withdraw medical cards from people as a matter of policy. The Deputy is well aware that for many years community welfare officers from various parts of the country were in a position to make a judgment in regard to whether a card should or should not be allocated, which made for uneven allocation of cards. The centralisation of the process has resulted in a more even allocation across the board.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	In regard to the cases highlighted, the facilities, aids and appliances required by a sick child or adult are met by the long term illness scheme. The question that arises is how far can we stretch discretion given the equality of assessment that applies in terms of the income limits. I have been informed by the HSE that it has been flexible in dealing with individual cases. I accept that in centralising applications to one database cases can be missed and that the nature of the machine is that it does not recognise the circumstances in which people find themselves. I, too, have dealt with a number of these cases. I understand that members of the family mentioned by the Deputy were in discussions about the matter today with personnel from the HSE. A series of presentations are being made regarding automatic qualification for a full medical card depending on the nature of a person's condition or circumstances. As the Deputy will be aware, the system provides for a full medical card, long term illness entitlement, a discretionary medical card and an emergency medical card. The problem that arises is if one decides to change the law in respect of particular categories, which may include people whose cases are very difficult to deal with, how far does one go? As I understand it, it is estimated an additional 250,000 people will be diagnosed diabetic in the next ten years.  I engaged early this morning with the HSE about these cases and will engage further on the matter tomorrow with medical personnel. I accept that the review process in the context of the sharing of information between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection results in an assessment of approximately 80,000 cases per month. In this regard 30,000 people are never written to because it is clear they are entitled to a full card and 30,000 are asked to report on whether their conditions have changed and so on. Some of the remaining cases can be problematic. Nobody wants to see any child left without assistance.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	The case of Alex Coyle was described on the "Saturday Night Show" as barbaric. It is barbaric. During the show a photograph was shown of the young boy in intensive care following a seizure. Anybody who saw it would not have to think twice about what needs to be done. His medical card must be restored. I am surprised the Taoiseach has not picked up on the matter. People all over the country are posting messages about it. They are in shock at what has happened. The Taoiseach was warned about this two years ago. It is clear that young and elderly people with chronic terminal conditions are being targeted in terms of withdrawal of their discretionary medical cards. Thousands of discretionary medical cards have been already withdrawn. Many times, I have given the Taoiseach lists of people whose cards have been withdrawn. This is not about another list, rather it is about the need for systemic change.

I invite the Taoiseach to view the clip of the show about which I am speaking. I think it will change his mind. Let us forget the red tape and forcing children to go through hoops and sort out this mess once and for all. Everybody here knows what is a medical card. Let us give back medical cards to the children who need them.

That was the least we felt we could do. Given the scale of equipment and medicine required by the child concerned, there is no way his family can meet his needs. There is no way they can do it without a medical card.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	Taking all of the children who have problems of one sort or another, be they physical, intellectual and so on, how does one ensure equality between one person with a particular medical circumstance and another? Where in this regard is the line to be drawn? As I said earlier in my discussions with the HSE, when a system such as this is centralised and computerised the nature of it is lost because of the manner in which the machine selects cases for review. The challenge for the Minister and the Government is to have a system that is fair but takes into account these circumstances. While I said earlier that I had not seen the programme referred to, that does not mean I am not aware of it. When I get an opportunity, I will, of course, look at it. I, too, have come across some really difficult cases, some of which were approved and others were not. There are cases in respect of which flexibility is required, even for people who have incomes in excess of the limits. Even where flexibility is applied, one can run into problems in terms of equality of treatment and the reason one person gets a card versus another. I accept this is an issue. I also have been contacted by parents regarding sensitive and difficult cases. Nobody wants to see this happening. The question that arises is whether we can devise a system that caters for that in a way that is in compliance with the law that has been in place for some time. I am looking at that. 
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	I agree with Deputy Martin on the medical cards issue, which I have raised with the Taoiseach many times to no avail. Today, however, I want to ask him about his announcement on the water tax. I noted once again that he had gone to the media with this announcement as opposed to coming into the Dáil to discuss it. Let us be clear: from what we know, this is a water tax. It is Fianna Fáil policy and totally contrary to the stated policy of the Labour Party. It is the latest in a series of taxes the impact of which will be greatest on families on low and middle incomes. These families will have to pay, at the very least, €240 each year. At least 1 million households will be forced to pay this water tax despite having no meter. The parties which support this — Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party — must take full responsibility for the added tax burden that will be placed on struggling households on top of the family home tax, the septic tank charge, the carbon tax, cuts to child benefit and cuts affecting carer's allowance and medical cards. The media briefings by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, the Taoiseach and the Labour Party could be presented as a modern version of Dean Swift’s A Modest Proposal, but there is nothing modest about the Government's proposal. There is nothing eloquent about its media spin and nothing satirical. The Government is deadly serious. Does Fine Gael believe the people are stupid? Does it believe they do not see what is happening and that they are fooled by the claims it is making? This shows just how far removed the Government is from hard-working families and vulnerable citizens. Whatever about the Labour Party's position, Fine Gael knows this figleaf will not cover the Labour Party's blushes. Is it not the case that the Cabinet's manoeuvring in recent weeks on this issue had nothing to do with relieving the burden on vulnerable citizens or bringing about safe water supplies and all other necessary services? Is it not very clear that this was all about the elections and public anger at the Government's duplicity?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	I do not at all accept the Deputy's charge. The Government made a decision on the issue this morning. We were accused by Fianna Fáil of not having the courage to spell out what the average charge would be and the conditions that would apply to lower it for certain sectors. As I stated last week, the Deputy is party to decisions on the water charges people pay in Northern Ireland, but he refuses to acknowledge this. I am not sure whether in the South he is presenting the view that one should pay for nothing and contribute nothing and that all of these services should be provided free of charge.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I want Deputy Gerry Adams to understand that in the discussions we have had in recent weeks this issue was taken very seriously and engaged on constructively. The Government has issued a direction to the regulator stipulating that the subvention of €537 million is conditional on the average charge being €240 per year, or €60 per quarter. Taking into account the difficulties, hardship and challenges many people face and which I recognise, there are sectors that clearly require assistance. That assistance is being given in particular circumstances through the household benefit charge and the benefits for carers, those with a disability, those who are blind and so on. It is also taken into account that children obviously bring with them costs and charges in the daily running of a household. The Government has recognised this by providing extra assistance in that children are to be given a 38,000 litre allocation, which effectively makes all children under the age of 18 years free. There is an allowance of an extra €100 in the categories I have mentioned. A pensioner living alone, for example, will have 40% of his or her water needs covered by the free allocation of 30,000 litres. Together with the allocation of €100, this will mean that the pensioner's liability for the year will be approximately €138, or less than 50 cent per day. It is obvious, although Deputy Gerry Adams does not want to recognise it, that water is a precious and scarce enough resource. It must be conserved and used well. It is probably the most abused natural resource in the country. Metering brings with it an incentive to conserve in that one can turn off the tap. In that sense, the Government has tried to make this measure as fair, affordable and incentivised as possible. Thus, people will understand they are in control of it. The allocation of the extra €100 will be to the benefit of pensioners, the elderly and those who receive benefits under the household benefits package. In addition, the Government will make available assistance in exceptional cases, as applies currently in the case of electricity and gas where the need arises. The intention is to deal with the fact that 40% of water in the system is leaking away, thus costing the taxpayer €1.2 billion per year. We have inferior treatment works and pipework and there are 23,000 people subject to boil water notices. This needs to be dealt with. We have tried to make the contribution as fair and equitable as possible. The price point, by contrast with the figures of €2,000 and €3,000 that had been bandied about, is the lowest we can achieve without having to put the charge back on the Government's books. In that sense, the assistance decided on this morning by the Government, including Fine Gael and the Labour Party, was made available with a view to making the system as fair, equitable and incentivising of conservation as possible.

He is dishonest in claiming Uisce Éireann can tell householders how much they will pay for water in the next few years. His proposal brings us only to 2016, just in time for the commemoration of the Easter Rising, at which point the tax will increase. The Taoiseach knows this. These charges never decrease; they always increase.

He has been proved wrong in this case. Meters constitute a conservation measure. The Deputy has tried to insinuate in some way that people are amadáns or stupid. I disregard this completely and it is beneath the Deputy to say it.

One can measure the level of conservation. I have been very pleased with the results in saving huge volumes of water.Regarding people who decide not to pay, this is not fair to all of those people who are hard pressed and who do make a contribution. While water is very necessary for life, fundamentally, people are not going to have their water connection cut off but there will be a case of reduced pressure where people decide not to pay.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	The Deputy would be the first on his feet saying that we cannot cut them off completely, nor is there any intention to do so. However, if we are to have a contribution from everybody, with assistance for those who are in particular need, the answer to the Deputy's question is that the penalty is reduced pressure. Any review of the average metered charge is deferred until 2016. The Deputy said that this is running until after the next election. Yes, it is. Far be it from me to determine what the people will want to do with their votes in 2016, when they come to judge this Government on whether it has fulfilled its mandate of sorting out our public finances and getting our country working or not. The question of a review will be dealt with by whatever Government is elected by the people after the general election in 2016. This Government has taken all of these things into account. As I said, it is the last major issue imposed on the people. It has been known to be coming for quite some time. In so doing, we have taken into account children, the elderly, the vulnerable, the disabled, the blind, those on boil water notices and those who receive benefits through the household package, and there is provision for those where exceptional hardship or exceptional circumstances arise. In that sense, not only will it deal with the inadequacy of the system at the moment, it will provide a platform of provision of high quality, high volume, pristine water for generations to come, which is what it is necessary to do. Governments in the past shirked their responsibility in facing up to that. This Government will not, and it has been as fair and as affordable to the people as possible.

While the main news reports today are focusing on Irish Water and the so-called free allowance for children, the people I am speaking about may not have a home within which to access that water allowance. I have to say I am horrified by what I am seeing. I have been dealing with housing issues as a public representative for nearly 25 years and I have never seen anything like what I am seeing now. This morning the list of homeless families I am dealing with has gone from 12 to 14. Twelve of those families have children, and among them are two mothers who are at the late stage of pregnancy. This is adding dangerous stress to those individuals, one of whom was reported on during "Morning Ireland" this morning. The irony is that these mothers would not be allowed home from a maternity hospital because they would not be allowed out to get into a car unless there was a car seat, but nobody is asking them if they have a home to go to. In many cases, they are required to rely on the charity of family and friends, which is very short-term, and that is if they are lucky. All of these families are feeling a sense of disbelief and are stressed out, and every one of them is frightened. The Taoiseach appointed a Minister with responsibility for children. One of the initiatives for which she took responsibility was putting children first, an initiative I applaud. However, what about the children of the families I have just talked about? What about the families in other areas like Dublin and Cork, which are seeing increasing numbers facing the same fate? The Minister, Deputy Burton's stock reply to parliamentary questions in regard to rent supplement is that it is only supposed to be a short-term solution. This suggests there is actually another solution.

If he does, I ask him to take direct responsibility and ensure that emergency measures of sufficient order to deal with the crisis are put in place immediately. Will he specifically look at the rent caps, which require urgent change, with a view to introducing a more flexible and more nuanced approach? Will he give a commitment that no family who present to a homeless unit in a local authority will be turned away without at least the offer of emergency accommodation?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, was dealing with aspects of the issue this morning. Clearly, it is not a situation that one wants to see, where families, for whatever reason, find themselves having to sleep in cars or having to be boarded in hotels in emergency situations. Deputy Murphy is very well aware from her experience here that, in the so-called tiger years, we were building 80,000 houses when we needed 10,000 or 12,000. We now need 25,000 houses a year or more, and we are building somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000. How do we rectify this problem?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	133	Build more houses, urgently.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	How do we move from a point where we acquire sites, provide funding streams for either local authorities or contractors to build houses, have an income stream coming in to pay for that and allocate people to these houses? During 2014, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, as she has already said, intends to maximise the number of housing for homeless households. It is not satisfactory the way it is, but it is largely within the various social housing mechanisms that have applied for some time that we have to deliver this in the short term. For the first time in quite a number of years, there is a return to direct build of social housing by local authorities. In February 2013, the Government's policy on homelessness was published in which the Government set out its aim to end long-term homelessness by 2016.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	It is a fantasy. Dream on.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	That emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as a primary response to all forms of homelessness. In the past two years, some 1,500 people here in Dublin have moved from the homeless sector to independent living, which is significant but obviously not enough. The homelessness oversight group was established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing all of that policy. At its meeting on 25 February this year, the Government approved the establishment of a homelessness policy implementation unit, which is tasked with implementing the homelessness oversight group's first report. That will include the preparation and the publication of a structured, practical plan to make the transition from shelter-led emergency accommodation to a sustainable housing-led response to homelessness to achieve the goal of 2016 for putting an end to this. In 2014, for example, the national homelessness budget will be maintained at €45 million, which is the same as last year. Investment of over €50 million was also provided through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and similar investment is expected again this year. In addition, the HSE spends €30 million annually providing care supports for the homeless. A high level, three person oversight group was established to review the approach being adopted here. Some of these are people who have considerable experience and they submitted their first report to the Minister on 19 December last year. I share the Deputy's view that this is a problem that has been building up for quite some time. It is not good enough to have adults and children sleeping in cars or being boarded in hotels. The answer is that we have to provide housing. As the Minister pointed out, with the best will in the world, we have to start with boarded up units, revamp and renovate them and make them available in the short term, and get the system in place for providing direct social housing. However, there is also the fact there is a substantial land bank, particularly in the Dublin area, and there are good contractors willing to provide private housing. The kind we provide, the mix we provide and the scale at which we provide that is where we need to be.I want to see an end to this, but it will not happen overnight. The Minister of State will obviously look at the question of the rent cap mentioned by the Deputy.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	Much of the Taoiseach's response was about what we would describe as traditional homelessness, which is, obviously, a major ongoing issue that needs to be addressed. This is entirely new territory involving families who one would never have expected to become homeless. I read an article by Kitty Holland yesterday which stated that in 2012 the Dublin authorities had spent €455,000 in looking after families that had presented to them. This year they expect to spend €4.5 million on bed and breakfast accommodation, which is an inadequate solution. This does not even make economic sense. Somebody presenting to the sections dealing with the homeless in Kildare and other locations, even with a child, is not necessarily offered a place in bed and breakfast accommodation, a hotel or other accommodation. He or she is told to find his or her family or a friend. What will happen during the summer when big concerts like the Garth Brooks concerts take place and all of these hotel rooms are absorbed? Ironically, there are so many on housing waiting lists that one could fill Croke Park for three nights in a row. I know things are difficult economically and that this is a legacy issue, but does the Government have a bottom line? Surely in 2014 the bottom line is that one will not allow a family with children to present as homeless and sleep in a car? Surely the provision of shelter is one area in which there is a point beyond which one does not allow families and children to fall? Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the Government will recommence large-scale building? Even if he were to announce building today, not one of the houses would be delivered before the Government finished its term of office. Will the Government buy properties in locations where there is the greatest pressure? It is not just a question of reviewing rent caps. There must be much more flexibility within them. It is not just people in Dublin who are affected; others in other areas also need a review.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	138	There is a combination of things involved. The Deputy refers to returning to large-scale building. There are processes to be followed in that regard in terms of planning permission, site acquisition, site preparation and demolitions, in some cases. As the Minister of State pointed out this morning, for the first time in quite a number of years there has been a return to direct build in the case of social housing. Admittedly, it is not of the scale we would like to see in trying to catch up. NAMA has a very substantial land bank in Dublin and other locations, some of which has been offered for acquisition for direct build. The question of the mix, design and type of houses one should provide arises, as does the question of the rent cap, to which I have referred. The Deputy referred to buying houses. The Minister of State has already pointed out that a couple of hundred houses are being revamped and brought back into commission quickly. It is a contradiction in terms of the kind of city Dublin is. Many regard it as being one of the outstanding cosmopolitan cities in Europe and beyond, yet one finds places boarded up that should not be. Obviously, there are particular reasons this happens. We discussed the matter with the Dublin city manager last week at the Cabinet sub-committee and there is serious intent to try to deal with it in the best way possible. What is the bottom line? The bottom line is the Government's statement to eliminate homelessness by 2016. Obviously, we do not have any time to waste. I thank the Deputy for her question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	139	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, together.  I travelled to Davos, Switzerland to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum from 22 to 24 January. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, also attended the forum. The World Economic Forum annual meeting is attended by political and business leaders and heads of international organisations from across the globe. The theme of this year's meeting was "The reshaping of the World; Consequences for Society, Politics and Business". On Wednesday evening, 22 January, I attended a function hosted by Professor Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the forum, that was also attended by other Heads of Government and the business council of the World Economic Forum. I participated in a number of formal events on the programme on current global economic matters. These included an interactive lunch session on the Thursday entitled, The New Europe Context, which focused on priorities for fiscal and monetary reform and drivers of global competitiveness. Later that day I took part in a high level plenary session entitled, Closing Europe's Competitiveness Gap, which examined how Europe's leaders were transitioning from crisis response mode towards a long-term strategy for competitiveness and growth. Other panellists in the discussion included José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission; Angel Gurría, secretary general of the OECD; Frederik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of Sweden; Fabrizio Saccomanni, Italy's then Minister of Economy and Finance; and Joe Kaeser, president and CEO of Siemens, Germany. I did not have a scheduled meeting with President Barroso at the World Economic Forum other than a brief encounter with him, with the other panellists at the preparatory session in advance of the live panel debate on global competitiveness. I participated in a high level discussion session on Friday, 24 January on the prevailing global themes for 2014, which included the political situation in the Middle East, global financial issues and climate change. During my time at the World Economic Forum I also held several bilateral meetings. With the Minister for Finance, I met US Secretary of the Treasury, Jacob Lew. I briefed Secretary Lew on recent positive economic developments in Ireland, including Ireland's successful return to the bond markets. I referred to the medium-term economic strategy published in December and the Government's commitment to continuing the reforms in the public finances, the financial sector and the real economy. We discussed European banking issues, including the proposed deal on a banking union and corporate tax reform. I reiterated Ireland's commitments to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and maintaining a competitive, transparent and predictable corporate tax regime underpinned by statute. Secretary Lew expressed some confidence that a comprehensive US tax reform deal might be achieved this year. We also discussed the current economic situation in the United States. We noted the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and that good progress had been reported at the third round TTIP negotiations which had taken place in December. While in Davos, I met individually with leaders of several major multinational firms from a variety of fields, principally in the high tech and financial services areas. This was my third visit to the forum and the first since Ireland had successfully exited the EU-IMF programme of assistance. I was keen to emphasise Ireland's pro-business and world-class research and development environment, as well as our young, well educated and flexible workforce as key elements that made Ireland an excellent place in which to invest. On Thursday evening, 23 January, I participated in an event attended by senior executives of major international companies which was organised by IDA Ireland to promote Ireland as an excellent business location. I acknowledged the vital contribution that many of the companies represented had made to Ireland and the economy and urged other guests to seriously consider Ireland as a potential location for investment or expansion.  My principal focus at the forum was on business and investment in Ireland. I did not have an opportunity to discuss Irish Aid or our overseas development programme in any great detail at the sessions and meetings which I attended. While I frequently referred to Ireland's path to economic recovery and growth, I did not discuss specifics relating to the Irish property sector during my time at the forum. The topic of trade and services across Europe formed part of the overall discussions on EU competitiveness and I discussed the prospect of expanding our trade in services with several of the companies that I met. Unemployment, in particular youth unemployment and the measures being undertaken to address it, was a constant theme throughout the forum, particularly in the discussions on competitiveness. I stressed at every opportunity that jobs and growth creation were the Government's key priorities, matching the priorities agreed in Europe through the EU 2020 strategy.I also emphasised that the key to tackling youth unemployment is the creation of an environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	At the outset, the House should note that most of these questions were tabled four months ago but are only now up for answer. The Taoiseach would have to agree that this is entirely unsatisfactory. It is partly because the Taoiseach has halved the Taoiseach's questions periods. That was a decision of this Government. Traditionally, before this Dáil, questions to An Taoiseach were answered twice a week. Now they are answered once a week. Also, when the Taoiseach cancels some sessions he does not reschedule them. I accept that he has to cancel the question sessions sometimes, for obvious reasons, but they are never rescheduled. Every Opposition party and group has asked for this to change and for something to be done about it but the Taoiseach seems to be quite happy to let the questions lie, unanswered, for months on end. It is unsatisfactory from a parliamentary point of view. Davos this year included the ECB President, Mr. Draghi, making a major statement about the European economy and financial system. According to his analysis, the fundamental reasons for the improved economic situation in member states are the general improvement in the international economy and critically, low ECB interest rates. The recent OECD review has confirmed this, although the Government spun the report in order to ignore this key point. President Draghi also said, however, that the recovery is still extremely fragile and that there are major down side risks. Why are we not addressing those risks and why do we not have any proposals to address them? Why is Europe being left with policies that were agreed two years ago, which have not succeeded in rejuvenating the eurozone economy?  President Draghi has confirmed that members of the ECB council want the Central Bank of Ireland to sell its holdings of Irish bonds earlier than was announced last year. This would end the entire claimed benefit of the promissory note deal and lead us to losing billions of euro. The minutes of the ECB meeting around the time of the promissory note deal explicitly stated that the ECB noted the arrangement between our Government and the Central Bank of Ireland. Has the Taoiseach made representations to President Draghi on this issue? Has the Government done anything in response to this particular request from members of the ECB? Has the Irish Government asked the ECB to return profits on Irish bonds to us? This is being done for Greece but not for Ireland. Has the Taoiseach formally tabled this issue? I have asked this question on numerous occasions but the Taoiseach keeps avoiding and fudging an answer. Has he raised that issue? Greece got such a deal and accommodation from the ECB and Ireland should too.  In the context of the Davos meetings with major international companies, the Taoiseach has already said that corporation tax and taxation structures were discussed, as were the very important policy pillars that lead to companies investing in Ireland. The foreign direct investment side of the economy has been the most resilient throughout the entire economic crash because of long-established policies not just on corporation tax but also on investment in education, research and development, which has been transformed in the past decade and has been a key factor in attracting inward investment. I have no doubt that those companies would have placed a strong emphasis on education, research and development. How does that square with the cuts that the Government has implemented in education across the board? The ending of postgraduate grants, in particular, is having a very severe impact on the numbers taking up postgraduate work and going further into research and development. The lack of any secure tenure or career options for people in research into the future also impacts on our overall environment for research investment.  Finally, on corporation tax, the OECD and so forth - what is our bottom line? The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, has implications for foreign direct investment. A Department of Finance analysis some years ago indicated that it could be far more harmful to our foreign direct investment strategy than changing the rate of tax itself. We need a stronger position and greater clarity from Government on that issue. The Government has agreed to discuss it and to facilitate the processing of the file on CCCTB. It could have a very significant impact on our attractiveness as a base for inward investment.  Was there any discussion at Davos about the banks themselves, their activities, the performance of their members and so forth? There is much talk about competitiveness but it seems to impact on the citizen only, in the form of new taxes, cuts and so forth. The citizen has no sense that the elites within the banking system and those who made decisions in auditing firms and so on are having the same burden placed upon them as the ordinary citizen during this crisis. That is the genuine view out there. People see large companies getting significant write-downs on debt but for those in mortgage arrears, there is very little comfort in many cases. In the most recent case of the IBRC sell-off, mortgages have been sold to an entity that does not have to adhere to the code of practice. The Governor of the Central Bank told the Taoiseach that he did not want to go ahead. There is no protection at all for those mortgage holders and their situation is very uncertain indeed. One of the problems with big gatherings such as Davos is they are conducted at a certain macro level but they do not really get what the citizen on the street has to deal with.  Finally, I put it to the Taoiseach that the real crisis in developed economies in the West is the suppression of middle incomes. We are looking at a shrinking middle class across the eurozone. Competitiveness is a code word for downward pressure on wages across the board in the forlorn hope that we can compete with China, India and other very low-wage countries. A fundamental change and reappraisal of where developed economies want to go in the future is required. Our direction is very unclear and that is giving rise to political developments across Europe which do not auger well in terms of how Europe evolves into the future.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	Deputy Martin got through a long list of questions there. I have seen many Taoiseach's questions sessions over the years and they used to be worse. When they were held on a Tuesday and a Wednesday, repetition was frequent because the range of questions applicable to the Taoiseach of the day is not as broad as to other Ministers. Deputy Martin has strayed into a whole load of detail here about individual Ministries. I have said to Deputies Martin and Adams previously that I do not have a problem with them tabling a priority question to me each week so that they can raise matters of immediate importance. It is a bit ridiculous that I am answering questions now about events that occurred some months ago. I have made that offer to Deputies Martin, Adams and others and if they want to take it up I would be happy to respond to them. The issue of the ECB and the selling off of material here is a matter for the Governor of the Central Bank and he has already made his position very clear on this. While the ECB noted the arrangement in respect of Ireland, it is a matter for the Governor here and he has been quite clear on that. On corporation tax and the policy pillars, Deputy Martin is well aware of the situation that applies here in so far as the legislative structure is very much behind the digital advances that are being made. Companies that operate here or in other countries move through several jurisdictions before the tax regimes and facilities in different jurisdictions kick in. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, ended the State-less concept here in last year's budget because of potentially damaging perceptions and he made that perfectly clear. We have been very much up-front in the leading group in saying one does need an international response to an international issue. That is why the OECD was deemed to be the appropriate body. Ireland has been very much up-front with the OECD and the European Commission in all queries that come before it. That is the way we want to be in order that when there is an international response to this international issue, Ireland will play - and is playing - its full part in that regard. Foreign direct investment has been a cornerstone of investment policy here. The Deputy is aware of Ireland's attractions, including the corporation tax rate, the talent pool, the track record of Irish people in so many areas and our capacity to deal with whatever technological challenges arise. As regards whether we have a bottom line, we will await the outcome of the OECD's analysis and deliberations with various countries and will move on from there. Ireland did not favour the common consolidated corporate tax base because of our proximity to Britain. It was allowed on the agenda for the first meeting of the Irish Presidency under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. Countries that wish to pursue it can proceed with their deliberations, although I am not sure it has gone far. The reality is different from the perception of what it might actually mean.  I did not have discussions about individual banks here with the Minister. Perhaps he had discussions about changes in the structure of and the health and recapitalisation of banks and our belief they could measure up in the stress tests to be taken later this year. The Deputy said "competitiveness" was a code word, but the mandate given to the Government was to sort out the public finances and get the country working. We have made this perfectly clear in a whole range of areas in which the tax system has been used to provide an opportunity and an incentive to create employment. For example, the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% stabilised the hospitality sector, but it also allowed many thousands of jobs to be created. We hope this can continue in the future. It was also evident in the decision, after listening to the industry, to abolish the travel tax. Ryanair responded by committing to bringing an extra 1 million passengers to Ireland this year through various airports. In that sense, I have tried to focus not just on foreign direct investment but also on stimulating Enterprise Ireland's work on the export capacity of Irish business. Through An Action Plan for Jobs which is published quarterly by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton there is a genuine attempt to ease the path and remove blockages to doing business. That is why the Micro-Finance Agency was introduced, with the partial loan and credit guarantee scheme. It is important for business to understand that in 50% of cases in which business plans were not deemed to be appropriate by the banks the requests for credit were overturned by the Credit Review Office. Therefore, if a small or medium-sized enterprise is turned down by a bank, there is a 50:50 chance of it being approved on appeal to the Credit Review Office. There are various incentives and schemes for young people, in particular, who always have the problem of not being able to get a job without experience, while they cannot get experience without having a job. Some schemes have been more successful than others. It is not just about competitiveness which is a fundamental element in the attraction of investment but also about building confidence in order that people can see things are beginning to improve. That is evident in different parts of the country. This morning I was in the Dublin docklands talking to representatives of the retail sector. They have come through a torrid time and many of them have not drawn anything from their businesses for some time. They now see opportunities beginning to emerge. It is important to note, for instance, that the Government's €500 million programme to extend fibre connection to 1,100 towns and villages in the next two years will provide for speeds of international scale. It will also allow small businesses and individuals to work from home or elsewhere as if they were in city centre locations. These elements are all part of the Government's response to attempt to use the tax system and the experience of those involved in business by offering opportunities to increase employment. In the process people can be taken off the live register and given a sense of hope, confidence and trust that they can improve their lot.  The new social contracts built into water metering or in multinationals coming here to look at the talent pool, experience and motivation of persons on the live register have been a surprise to many. They find that, instead of it being just a list of people who are long-term unemployed, in many cases there is experience and talent that can add greatly to the status of firms.  When the Deputy says these gatherings are over the top, certainly I have to-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	When our folks were putting together a sense of this in response to the questions put to the Taoiseach, I asked them to find something notable the Taoiseach had said. When we looked at something he might have said that was notable at Davos four months ago, I came on something he had said there two years ago. When he brought forward his analysis of an géarchéim eacnamaíochta, he said: "People went mad borrowing in a system that spawned greed, went out of control and led to the crash." That analysis of the causes of the crisis in the economy, to which I assume he still sticks, was wrong then and is wrong today.It just shows one. That was the Taoiseach's input. In response to Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach said that if these guys are a bit aloof and elite, there are politicians there to keep them right. However, he told them that this was Paddy gone mad. He knows that people did not go mad and did not do this out of greed. They were buying family homes or providing apartments for their children and were cajoled into borrowing large sums of money during boom times. The price was driven through the roof because of successive Fianna Fáil Governments' policies. That is what the people are being punished for, not their own greed. It is because of the greed of bankers, developers and speculators. Fianna Fáil takes the blame of course, but the Taoiseach was the then-Leader of the Opposition. Whatever he says about Sinn Féin, I would like to think he gives us credit for trying to hold the Government to account, whether he agrees with us or not. He was there at the time and the Government is only as good as the Opposition. We now come to his last visit, when the Taoiseach said that emigration to foreign parts was good for citizens and a way of gaining experience which could be used on their return home. Those remarks were irresponsible and offensive. The two main failures of the two States on this island, particularly this one and particularly of its ruling elites and Governments, are partition and emigration. It moulds our psychology as a people that so many generations of our people have been forced to leave. Travel is good and it broadens the mind, but one should not be forced to do so and to rear children abroad. The Taoiseach must have met people, especially those from Mayo, who have put children through college who are now in Australia, Canada and London. I meet them all the time. Those people have grandchildren who are not coming home. On the world stage, the leader of the State has said two notable things at recent meetings of this grouping at Davos. Imagine a town of 400,000 which has been emptied. What about getting them back? What incentive is there for someone out there to come back? They did not leave for experience other than in the case of a very small minority. Many of them went because they did not want to stay here where they could not make a living. Many went because their friends had gone. I remember meeting a very old man who is one of the last of those who left the Blasket Islands. I met him in Springfield, Massachusetts, and he spoke to me in Gaeilge. I asked him why there were so many of his peers there. He asked me if I had ever seen a flock of birds flying and said that where one comes down, another and another follows until the whole flock comes down. That is what we see. I try to get to Donegal. Scores of young men and women from the parish I visit are working in the mines. They found out about their friends being there and they went because they could not get jobs or a home here. The Irish youth unemployment rate is approximately 23% and it is irresponsible for the Taoiseach to speak so casually while on foreign trips, especially to a gathering like that at Davos, which is elite, and particularly when there is nothing in place here to induce those folks to come back. Hopefully, there will be space for them to come back, but I ask the Taoiseach if he regrets making those two remarks. It is little wonder that those in the elites in the European Union and at events like Davos think they can do what they want when the leader we sent to represent us comes off with such remarks. The Taoiseach is not Davos's man in Ireland, he should be Ireland's man in Davos. Would the Taoiseach like to take this opportunity to correct the record?

Perhaps I did not phrase myself as clearly as I could have. What I was trying to do was point out the situation where our country went over the edge economically. I heard the reports from the son of the late Tom Gilmartin who spoke the other night about his family's experience of what happened and the culture that existed in our country. It is true to say my party was in opposition at the time and it is also true that if Deputy Adams checks the record, he will find that the then-spokesman on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, raised year after year at budget time the growing housing bubble particularly in Dublin and throughout the country. Nobody listened and nobody wanted to listen.

Deputy Adams mentioned two things that are fundamental to Irishness, emigration and partition. He rightly states that this has an impact on our psychology and the kind of people we are. He also clearly made the point about where I come from myself and asked how one gets back 400,000 people. I said in reply to some of these questions previously that, on the trade mission to Japan, I spoke to 16 or 17 young Irish engineers who were working in Osaka to build turbines for gas energy plants. Their contribution to engineering at the very highest level and changing its frontiers does one proud. It was because of their talent and their skill. There are thousands who have availed of their ability and potential. Yes, I feel sorry for those who feel they are forced to go away. I grew up in the west of Ireland. Last Saturday, I happened to be the patron of a fund-raising project for breast cancer research, which involved arduous cycling. On the way to Achill, I passed a sign noting the twinning with Cleveland, Ohio. When I was a child, it was more typical and logical for people from that part of our country to go to Cleveland as had happened in pre-Famine and post-Famine times. It was more logical to go to work in Cleveland than in Westport. That is in the people, although I am not saying it applies now as one does not want it to. The trend of emigration and what the fear Gaeltacht Deputy Adams spoke to from the Blaskets said are part of our psychology and personality. I agree with the Deputy on that. Some of my own extended family worked in the copper mines in Butte at the turn of the last century and raised their families there. Many of their descendants came back just last year as part of the Gathering. Long lost unknown connections were re-established to foster new relationships. To deal with this requires an economy that is in shape, well run and provides opportunities for growth and new ideas. This morning, people in the retail sector were talking about different ideas to give vent to that creativity and capacity.We cannot do it unless there is openness and willingness to give an opportunity for it to happen. For small and medium-size enterprises to access credit through the local enterprise offices, which are now in the local authorities with new devolved responsibilities, hopefully it will be a success and people will get proper and accurate information, mentoring and the connections they need to follow through so that the processes, through the Action Plan for Jobs and access to credit, will help them get on the rung of the ladder. I would love to see people coming back. I spoke to a young man from the south of Ireland last year. He was drawing a social welfare payment of €188, then went to Australia to work for 15 months, cleared almost €100,000 and came back and put his little transport company on the road. I admire the young man for his initiative, hard work and dedication to wanting to come back and getting the means to do so. Not everyone does that. We must ask whether we can put our country in a place that we have the invitation and the opportunity for people to come back. It is not easy for married people who have families to leave when work is not available locally because they have been caught in negative equity or mortgage distress. When the Government produces its construction programme next week, I hope it will add some dimension of an incentive to have registered contractors carry out works all over the country to provide employment and opportunity. We can follow that with a construction stimulus, given the scale of what we must do over the period ahead. I share the broader analysis of the Deputy on what partition and emigration meant to the Irish, particularly emigration. Having had discussions in Washington, I hope discussions between Republicans and Democrats in Washington result in legislation being brought through to deal with the undocumented Irish, many of whom want to go to live, work and contribute to the economy of the US and, at the same time, have the opportunity to travel back for family circumstances, such as weddings, funerals or other occasions. These were not discussed directly in Davos but the issue of transatlantic trade and investment partnership talks, for which Ireland through its Presidency got a mandate from the European Parliament and the Commission to go ahead with, was followed immediately by the response of President Obama at the G8 summit to get on with it. There have been constructive and successful meetings to date. Some of this gets very complicated but there is an opportunity for a couple of million jobs on either side of the Atlantic and the setting down of conditions for world trade for the coming generation given that the two greatest trading blocs on the planet are involved. In meeting some of the personnel involved, many of them have interests in Ireland because of headquarters from a European or world point of view or their investment through the services and products they provide. These are all part of the mix and we would like to think that things will be way we aspire to have them more quickly. There are serious numbers of unemployed people at European level and, given the difficulties many Governments face, it is not easy to get decisions through the European Council in the way we would like. These are matters we must work hard at. I hope we can have an opportunity in the future to discuss the second of the pillars because of its impact on our people and what it means for our history and for our future.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	I want to ask about two issues regarding Davos, one of which the Taoiseach addressed and the second he did not. I want to clarify that the Taoiseach did not talk about it when he should have. On the matter he talked about, fairly astonishingly, one of the big issues discussed at Davos was inequality and the need to address it. I will briefly pass over the enormous irony of some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people arriving in the Swiss Alps in helicopters and private jets to discuss what we should do about inequality, when most of them are the embodiment of the gross inequality that exists in the world. There is a certain irony in all of that. I wonder what the Taoiseach had to say on the issue of tackling inequality and what the Taoiseach came back with in terms of what will be done in this country to tackle the growing and - frankly - shocking inequality developing in Irish society. This is perhaps best evidenced by the absolute scandal referred to earlier, which I have raised many times over the past two years, of the housing and homelessness emergency that sees families and children in desperate situations of homelessness and insecurity, with all that goes with it. It is an extraordinary irony that the Government is putting through a Children First Bill this week. One of the first things the Children First guidelines set out is that it is a form of abuse to neglect a child and that those guilty of the neglect, which is a form of abuse, should be accountable for that abuse. It will be interesting to see whether the guidelines set this down legally in the legislation. Could there be anything more abusive and a better example of the neglect of the State and of its obligations to children than to have those children homeless and living in the most inappropriate situations imaginable in hostels on the other side of the city with chronic drug and alcohol users and on housing lists for 15 years while being buffeted from one place to another with no security? Let us imagine what this does to the welfare, psychology and emotional balance of a child going from an infant to an older teenager not knowing whether they have a secure roof over their heads. Let us imagine what that does to them in terms of a sense of place in society. I wonder what was said as the wealthy, powerful and privileged discussed at Davos the need to address inequality. What did the Taoiseach say about this inequality? What did he come back with in terms of tackling these gross forms of unacceptable inequality? I looked at the report card produced by the Children's Rights Alliance for 2014. It gives the Government E-, the second worst grade one can get, for tackling child poverty. Some 20% of children stated last year they go to bed hungry, which is extraordinary in the 21st century. What is the Government doing about it? In so far as we have some of the world's wealthiest people and the CEOs of some of the world's most profitable companies, which are at the centre of allegations of paying negligible or no tax, was there any suggestion that if these people paid a little bit more tax we might not have the same level of gross inequality and children going to bed hungry? Is that not the obvious conclusion they should have come up with at Davos, which any reasonable person would come up with when looking at this level of inequality in society? The second question flows from it.I asked the Taoiseach whether he discussed the issue of property and housing in Davos, because housing and property were at the centre of the global and Irish economic crisis. I have been trying to ring the alarm bells about this since the Government introduced the new property-based tax reliefs for property speculation, in the form of real estate investment trusts, two years ago. I warned the Taoiseach then that this could lead to a further speculative property bubble, but that was totally pooh-poohed by him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, although it is now becoming evident. Under the Fianna Fáil Administration, the Taoiseach suggested the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, had prophetic powers when it came to the property bubble, but strangely, this did not seem to stop Fine Gael councillors supporting planning permission for insane developments all over the country, which helped pump up property prices. However, we will set that aside here. Is the Taoiseach aware there is a serious danger now of another property bubble and what is he going to do to address this? The Taoiseach has been travelling around the world seeking investment and has visited places like Davos, and New York for St. Patrick's Day where he said to investors that if one was to build a few thousand houses in Dublin, one would have them sold within a week. In other words, he was encouraging people to speculate in property. This is extraordinary, given the role property speculation has played in our economic downfall. Did the Taoiseach go to Davos encouraging this sort of speculative investment in property in Dublin? Does he realise that in so far as the property bubble and the dramatic increase in rents and property values is happening, when he talks about the need to address the supply issue he seems to suggest this will be dealt with by investment in this area expanding supply? I put it to the Taoiseach that this shows the poverty of analysis in terms of what happened in the crash we have just been through. We had from 70,000 to 90,000 houses built a year, but that did not stop a bubble developing. Property prices do not stop spiralling out of control just because private investors move into the area of housing and property. We saw the biggest surge of investment in property during the Celtic tiger period and that did not reduce property values, but led to a spiralling out of control of property values. Is there not something fundamentally wrong with the assumption the Taoiseach seems to be relying on - that to resolve the problem, all we need is people to move in and invest in this area? Is it not obvious that people who invest in property invest for profit, not to house the people on the housing list? They will not invest to build housing for people on the housing list and will not be interested in low cost or affordable housing because they cannot make as much money from that. We need affordable housing in order to regulate the overall market. Is there any awareness on the part of the Taoiseach in his analysis of this situation that this is what we need? We need public investment in affordable housing, both to house the people on the lists and to regulate the housing market so as to prevent a further property bubble. Sadly, the Taoiseach seems to be touting speculation in Irish property internationally and I find that extraordinary.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	He could be a very good junior Minister. He put down a number of questions here. He wanted to discuss unemployment and growth, banking and sovereign debt and trade and services. He asked if I held private meetings with counterparts at the Davos World Economic Forum, whether I had any discussion on Ireland's housing and property sector there and whether I had any discussion on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership. Perhaps the Deputy thinks different meetings take place, but the forum is a structured occasion and one makes arrangements to meet particular personnel in whom the country might have an interest in terms of investment or further job opportunities. As I said in response to Deputy Martin, the forum began with a reception and an occasion hosted by the professor who has been running the forum for the past 30 years. The following day, I had meetings with Citigroup, Facebook and Adobe. We discussed the question of the new European context in which Ireland is an example of a country in very difficult circumstances dealing with a horrendous legacy. We have made significant progress and have exited the bailout programme and published an economic medium-term strategy which is working and to which we will adhere. I also met senior personnel from Takeda from Liberty Global and from Salesforce and participated in a panel discussion with the President of the European Commission, the Secretary General of the OECD, the chief executive of Siemens and the Prime Minister of Sweden, the then Minister for the Economy. I followed this with an engagement, organised by the IDA, with senior investment personnel in the country. I met the Treasury Secretary from the United States and met with people from the New York Stock Exchange, Bank of America, Bloomberg and so on. It was not a case of organising meetings about inequality, nor was it a case of arriving by helicopter. I arrived by bus and by car and walked around the streets, as I always do. The Deputy can forget about the days of an Ireland where people were flying around with doors falling off helicopters in their anxiety to get things opened. We live in a different world now. There was no discussion at Davos about the Dublin housing situation. The situation that occurred here was not caused by Davos. It was caused by light touch regulation, greed, incompetence, mismanagement and by the fact that the country, through a combination of these things and bad banking -----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	Absolutely. Banks were completely out of kilter with reality and they and all of this created the economic catastrophe for us. However, I am glad to say we are moving through that. There was no discussion with any of the people to whom I spoke about housing in Dublin. In response to the question on child poverty and child neglect, I agree child neglect is an abuse to children's potential, their young minds and the environment in which they are reared. This is an issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has been trying to deal with the situation of inadequate housing for so many people. The Deputy may think there is a dearth of analysis, but as he has heard me say previously, from a situation where local authorities granted housing permission all over the place for developments that were vast in scale, where 120,000 houses were built when only 20,000 were needed and where the speculative market was at its peak, we are now returning, for the first time in many years, to direct building for social housing. I agree we need to be able to regulate in as far as possible the management of this development so that we do not cause a housing bubble. This means managing the demand for housing, the scale of land available for building and the process of planning so that there can be a surplus of housing available to keep the property bubble down. Nobody wants to see a return to that bubble nor have we got it now. The Minister of State has already set out her main stall in this regard, in regard to contributions from the HSE, from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and direct building.  There is also a requirement for private enterprise and for the construction sector to step up to the mark, whatever the mix of housing will be, to deal with the problems we have now, where people are sleeping in cars and families with children in bed and breakfast lodgings and hotels. This is not satisfactory and is not the kind of Ireland to which we aspire. However, it is an Ireland and a problem with which we must deal, but we cannot do so overnight. It is not a case of in any way being inattentive to these issues. The Deputy spoke about a poverty of analysis. The situation on the ground is clearly not satisfactory, but, even given a serious intent to deal with it, it still cannot be dealt with overnight. Even the Deputy will understand this. Issues such as the provision of social housing are impacted on to the best extent by investment, the creation of growth and wealth in the economy and the creation of jobs. That is why the Government wants to see this filter throughout the land. It is why we have a €500 million investment in fibre connections in the many places that were bereft of it and have been for many years. It is why we need a water infrastructure throughout the country and the continued process of road building. None of these things was discussed in an Irish context at Davos, but they all are part of the general response in terms of how to get the economy growing, together with exports, the provision of services, proper banking systems and services, and continued investment in the country. In respect of investment, that pipeline remains very strong. It is why the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is in America talking to small exporting companies from Ireland which already employ 80,000 American people across 50 states. We need to see more of this, which requires growth at home. That growth will deal with the issue of poverty of opportunity for children and families.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to put a question. Before doing so, I acknowledge that the Taoiseach is dealing with a massive agenda and schedule and a huge number of interruptions and unplanned for things that arrive on his desk without warning. I agree that it is a tough position to be in. However, with the country in turmoil, would it not be time better spent by him if he were to make an interjection at Davos and ask for the programme to be put on hold while he brought colleagues' attention to the plight of this small country? It is a country that has been unfairly financially crushed by the losses of a private banking system that occurred because of the actions of boards of banks. These facts are measurable and provable not by any opinion but by a cold looking at the balance sheets of all the licensed deposit-taking banking and building society institutions in this country from 2002 onwards. These figures show us what caused the credit bubble. There cannot be a property bubble and property speculation unless there is credit and money to drive it. I e-mailed the Taoiseach last Thursday with an analysis of the credit pyramid and where the measurable causality lay. It lies, as I said, with the boards of banks. Every single board member of every bank and building society should be included within the remit of the banking inquiry. That inquiry is not rocket science and will only require people from at home with the right qualifications and experience. We do not need international consultants. The track record has been that all the international consultants and firms have invoiced very stiffly and hard for producing inaccurate reports. In the case of the listing of loans for transfer to NAMA, for example, they got the projected losses 100% wrong. The modelling for the first prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, in March 2010 was 100% wrong. It is a sequence of heavy invoices and poor analysis.

As Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, these are the elite, the powerful and the privileged. The book I gave the Taoiseach before Christmas, The Price of Inequality by Joseph Stiglitz, addresses one of the core themes of the conference, namely, that distributive economics has been shown - again, by facts and analysis, not by opinions, wishful thinking and ideologies - to be more constructive and progressive and better at generating economic activity than the neoliberal model of the past.

I had an opportunity to give a report from an Irish context on the difficulties we faced. I referred to the fact that there were no tools available when this difficulty struck Ireland and emphasised the requirement to follow through on decisions made by the European Council in respect of banking union resolution and the opportunity for consideration of direct recapitalisation in respect of the legacy position. The Deputy has argued his case cogently in many fora. It is important to point out, however, that were the same to happen now, the situation is very different in that the mechanisms have been put in place to deal with things in a more structured way than was possible when Ireland got into this mess in the first place.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	There was regret and sadness across the House at the news of the passing of Peadar Clohessy, a sadness which echoed the great sense of loss among the communities of Limerick East and the people and families Peadar had served with his characteristic diligence and integrity. He was an exceptionally kind and compassionate man. In his distinguished career as a public servant he took his constituents' concerns to heart and made them his own. In his every action as a politician he served the people. They were his sole concern, first and last, in decisions taken and positions held, in what were often difficult and even turbulent times within his party. Peadar Clohessy was first elected to Limerick County Council in 1979 and he went on to serve for 25 years. In 1981 he was elected to this House as a Fianna Fáil Deputy. He was a man of his community and home place, a man with a deep sense that politics was always about the people and less about the party. When he became a founding member of the Progressive Democrats Party, his desire was to do good and better, not alone for and by the people of Limerick East but for and by the country as a whole. Peadar's was a quiet, unassuming patriotism, perhaps all the more powerful and significant for being so. Of deep significance in his life was the sense and idea of home. He had a deep and abiding fondness for Fedamore and its great people, of whom he spoke often. I knew him well in those years. It was palpable that he was deeply rooted in his people and place. He loved its landscape and had a special place in his heart for its culture as expressed through traditional music and the Gaelic Athletic Association. I had the privilege of working with Peadar Clohessy when he was assistant Government Chief Whip in the early 1990s, at a time when I was Chief Whip for the Fine Gael Party. In our work together I always found him to be frank, decent and honourable and have a very particular and individual sense of humour. In that role, as in all his work, his standards and attitude exemplified the best sense and idea of politics and public service. His passing is deeply regretted on all sides of the House. However, while we have lost an esteemed former colleague, the Clohessy family has lost a father, someone who can never be equalled and can never be replaced. As Taoiseach and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I extend my sincere sympathy to Peadar's sons, Andrew, Patrick and Michael; his daughters, Alice, Margaret and Sinéad; his extended family and many friends. Sad as they are, all our partings are only for a while. Love, as they say, never dies. I am absolutely certain that we will once again meet those whom we love and have lost at some point in the future. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	Ba mhaith liom ar son pháirtí Fhianna Fáil agus ar son mo chomhghleacaithe, go háirithe na Teachtaí Willie O'Dea agus Niall Collins, ár gcomhbhrón a dhéanamh le clann Peadar Clohessy. Is pribhléid an-mhór é dom mar uachtarán Fhianna Fáil an ráiteas seo a thabhairt agus a rá gur Teachta Dála den chéad scoth ab ea Peadar Clohessy. Fear ciallmhar ceanúil ab ea é. Bhí suim faoi leith aige i gcúrsaí cultúrtha, go háirithe cultúr a dhúiche féin, i gcúrsaí spóirt, i gcúrsaí ceoil agus - gan amhras - i gcúrsaí reatha agus polaitíochta. D'oibrigh sé ar son a mhuintire go dian dícheallach, Domhnach is dálach. Is léir go raibh tionchar faoi leith aige sa Teach seo agus i gcúrsaí polaitíochta go ginearálta. I join the Taoiseach and all other Members in expressing sympathy to the Clohessy family on the death of their beloved father, Peadar. I particularly wish to express my sympathies to his sons, Andrew, Patrick and Michael, and his daughters, Alice, Margaret and Sinead. May the many happy and loving memories they share sustain them in the time ahead. By remembering the late Peadar Clohessy, the House is again acknowledging the central importance of public service in our society and our lives. Behind all the daily hustle and bustle of political adversarial engagement, the fundamental point with regard to participation in politics is that it involves public service. Peadar Clohessy personified this more than most. Public services and love of parish - Fedamore - county and country defined the man and informed his politics and how he behaved in the political arena. He was one of Irish politic's true gentlemen. Peadar was a great GAA lover and a passionate believer in the prospects of Limerick hurling. He was very much rooted in his local community and his county. We shared a memorable year. For me, as a Cork football supporter, 1973 was a magical year and it was also magical for Peadar in the context of Limerick's All-Ireland win. He had eternal belief in the capacity of Limerick to come back and win future All-Ireland championships. He is probably doing is very best above in heaven to try to influence the outcome of this year's championship. Peadar was clearly a great family man who enjoyed a long and happy marriage with his beloved wife, Jean. Sinead spoke very movingly at his funeral about their wonderful relationship and about what it meant to their children. Peadar was a farmer and he loved to be out and about meeting people. He was a very accessible individual, which was an important facet of his political life. He was elected to Limerick County Council in 1974 and went on to serve as a member for a quarter of a century. During that period, he also spent over 11 years as a Deputy. He contested many general elections from 1973 onwards, with the exception of one of those held in 1982. He contested four elections for Fianna Fáil and the final three for the Progressive Democrats. He was successful in gaining election on quite a number of occasions. We all recall the general hurly-burly and very difficult times of the 1980s, particularly the three general elections which occurred during an 18-month period. In political terms, it was a extremely volatile period but Peadar gained respect from colleagues and those on the opposite side of the divide alike. He was first elected for Fianna Fáil in June 1981. He was not elected at the snap election held the following February but five years later he returned to the Dáil as one of 14 Progressive Democrat Deputies. He served in the House on behalf of that party for just over ten years before standing down in 1997. His best election was that which was held in 1987 when he easily took a second seat for the new party with over 6,000 first preference votes. That was my first election and an extremely difficult one it was indeed from my party's perspective. Peadar had huge personal support in his constituency. As Des O'Malley said at his funeral, Peadar was not a soundbite merchant and nor was he to be found in regular attendance on the plinth. Nonetheless, he knew how to differentiate between what really mattered to the people he represented as opposed to passing fancies. I understand from my colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and Niall Collins, that the constituency of Limerick East was highly competitive during the period to which I refer. However, Peadar showed remarkable tenacity and great astuteness in harnessing transferred votes left, right and centre and in remaining engaged with people. He won a seat in 1989 and 1992 in very difficult electoral circumstances for himself. He was greatly admired for both the tenacity to which I refer and for the success he achieved. He had personal appeal for those in all parties and those of us who remember him recall his gentlemanly demeanour, quiet disposition and engaging manner. He was intelligent and, above all, he knew the importance of the fourth and fifth preferences on the ballot paper. All those who are candidates in the forthcoming elections would do well to check his electoral record in that regard. The one constant in Peadar's political life was having Des O'Malley as his running mate. At three consecutive elections, they took two seats in Limerick East for the Progressive Democrats. It was only in 1997 when Peadar stood down that the second seat was lost. He and Des had in common the fact that they both had uncles who had served as Deputies before them. Paddy Clohessy was a very celebrated hurler and was elected to the Dáil alongside Des's uncle, Donogh O'Malley, in the elections of 1957, 1961 and 1965. His bond with Des was strongest when they left Fianna Fáil to establish the Progressive Democrats in 1985. I understand the decision to leave the party was an extremely difficult one for Peadar to make. At his funeral mass, his daughter, Sinead, stated that his decision to leave Fianna Fáil in the 1980s was "the hardest thing he had to do in his lifetime". Obviously, it was not a decision we welcomed at the time but we accepted fully that Peadar acted out of conviction and on principle. Less than four years after he left, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats went into government together and, as the Taoiseach indicated, he was the Progressive Democrats' Whip in that Administration. He worked very conscientiously and effectively in that capacity. It is fair to say that Peadar did a great deal for many people and that he worked hard for his constituency and for the country. He was calm and dignified in everything he did. He was also quintessential gentleman who had time to listen to everyone by whom he was approached. He had deeply held and cherished political principles and beliefs. He was closest to the people he represented and was always available and accessible. He loved his parish of Fedamore and his home county and was a great advocate for both. Following his time in politics and into his retirement, he did a great deal to restore the local cemetery and to protect his area's heritage, culture and folklore. His empathy and concern for people remained ever present. We would all do well to try to emulate Peadar in terms of the attributes he displayed during his time in politics. Perhaps he displayed them despite his involvement in politics. I again wish to extend our deepest sympathies to Peadar's sons, Andrew, Patrick and Michael, his daughters, Alice, Margaret and Sinead, and his nine grandchildren who loved him so dearly.

The first thing to say about the late Peadar Clohessy is that he exemplified what is best in public representatives across the political divide in the context of his genuine commitment to serving his community and to doing his best for the people he represented. It was well known that people could come to the home of the late Peadar and Jean Clohessy at any time and that, regardless of their backgrounds or their problems, the door was open to them and they received a warm reception. That was the kind of service Peadar provided for a quarter of a century as a member of Limerick County Council and for over 11 years as a Member of this House. I came to know Peadar during the course of several elections. I stood for my first general election in 1992 but I had met him previously as a result of our both being local representatives in Limerick. I witnessed at first hand the fact that he was a gentleman and that he was somebody for whom public service was a service to the people rather than about being for personal gain. He was rooted in his local community in Fedamore but also in the wider county of Limerick. His commitment to the GAA, traditional music, culture and the people around him was very evident and strong.He was also a man of principle and when the decision had to be made and he helped to form the Progressive Democrats, he made that decision, difficult as it was, and served his new party in the House as assistant Government Whip with great dedication and in the constituency also. He was a gentleman to his fingertips and someone whom people always enjoyed meeting and for whom they had a strong affection, no matter what their political affiliation. I join other Members in extending sympathy to Andrew, Patrick, Michael, Alice, Margaret and Sinead, the grandchildren and other family members in the Visitors Gallery.

Ní raibh aithne pearsanta agam air, ach chuala mé a ainm go minic thar na blianta. Níos luaithe, nuair a chonaic mé a chlann ag teacht isteach, bhí a fhios agam go raibh an clann sin, clann Pheadair agus Jean, ag croílár na hócáide seo. Chaill an clann sin athair a rinne obair anseo agus tá mise, an Taoiseach agus ceannairí eile ag déanamh ár ndíchill cúpla focal a rá faoi. Nuair a smaoiníonn an clann ar sin, tá súil agam go mbeidh siad sásta go bhfuil muid buíoch as an obair a rinne a máthair agus a hathair thar na blianta. I did not know Peadar Clohessy, although obviously I had heard his name through the years. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I extend my deepest condolences to all the family in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. I saw them coming while we were debating in the Chamber, as he would have done. It reminds me that family is at the heart of this occasion and that this is a great personal loss for the family, no matter when we lose a parent. This is a serious event during which the Taoiseach has led the tributes and we have heard a senior member of the Labour Party, the leader of Fianna Fáil and me, in my own modest way, try to give some consolation to the family above and beyond politics. I express solidarity with the family. Any family with a member, particularly a parent, engaged in public service and public life makes sacrifices. Mr. Clohessy's family know that and I thank them for it. I imagine that their mother, in particular, made many sacrifices during the years. I presume, although I am not sure, we have sisters of Peadar in the Visitors Gallery, but to the extended family - Patrick, Andrew, Michael, Alice, Margaret, Sinead; the nine grandchildren and the entire family circle and friends - I extend my deepest condolences. As we have heard, Peadar Clohessy served for decades as a local councillor and was elected to the Dáil in 1981. He was a member of Fianna Fáil and subsequently a founder member of the Progressive Democrats. Leaving politics to one side, I have always had a natural affinity with Gaels, especially when I hear about someone who loves the countryside, traditional music and so on. That is above and beyond the cut and thrust of political parties. I imagine his family feels his loss, following the loss of Jean, but I would like to think they will take great comfort from knowing that he made a positive contribution to public life and the well-being of the people of Limerick East.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I also express my deepest sympathy to the Clohessy family. I recall well the election held in June 1981 when Peadar was first elected after several unsuccessful attempts. The ticket included Des O'Malley, Peadar and me. Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil only got two seats and I was third in terms of votes cast, which meant that Peadar was elected. Unfortunately, from his point of view, the Government collapsed after seven months and he did not have a chance to consolidate and expand on his support. Interestingly, in the election in which he lost his seat his first preference vote hardly dropped; he received approximately the same number of first preference votes he had received in June 1981. It was simply the case that the number of votes for me went up and I replaced him in the Dáil, which was not a very happy occasion for me, seeing that my family and I had supported him so strongly during the years, as well as his late uncle, the former Deputy Paddy Clohessy. Of course, he made a comeback, as mentioned by the Taoiseach and Deputy Micheál Martin, and went on to serve several terms under the Progressive Democrats' banner. The fact that he occupied a seat in Dáil Éireann meant that both Fine Gael and ourselves failed to win a second seat on several occasions. Curiously, we did not begrudge him this because there was a general feeling he had been hard done by in losing his seat in February 1982. He was a tireless and dedicated worker for his constituents and a great champion for his people, particularly the disadvantaged people in the more rural part of the constituency. Peadar Clohessy was not a man for weighty policy speeches in the House. Nevertheless, when he had something to say, he said it and it is worth looking back over his contributions because they are a model of common sense, as befits someone who was so close to his people. His family have every reason to be singularly proud of him as an individual and a public representative. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I, too, join in the expressions of sympathy on the passing of Peadar Clohessy. I welcome his children and extended family to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery and the Visitors Gallery. He was an outstanding public representative in and from County Limerick. He was completely committed and dedicated to his family, community and constituency. Above all, he was completely committed to the people within his constituency, regardless of their political point of view. That was the marked key to his success, as articulated by other speakers. It is fair to say and worth noting that the Clohessy family have been on the political landscape in County Limerick for generations. Peadar Clohessy followed in the proud tradition of public service which had been instilled in him by his late uncle, the former Deputy and great Limerick hurler, Paddy, and his late father, Andy, who had cultivated in him at a young age a keen interest in politics. They attended many political events and political party meetings together. This generated the spirit of public service which was to flourish and grow into a full-scale career at local and national level. What rounded and grounded Peadar Clohessy was his many keen interests outside of the world of politics. They served to inform and help him in his role as a public representative. He had a notable interest in history, education, folklore, the countryside, farming and, of course, the GAA. Other contributors during these expressions of sympathy have noted his keen interest in the GAA in Limerick. He took to his grave the yearning for Limerick to put to bed the bogey of 1973 - Limerick has not won an all-Ireland hurling championship since - something we all share. I was proud to have known Peadar Clohessy. Although his long and distinguished career never overlapped with mine, I express my thanks and appreciation to him for his often sound advice and encouragement from which I benefited. Outside the Chamber we all act as constituency public representatives.In doing so, we travel the highways and byways of our constituencies. Many times, I had an opportunity to meet Peadar Clohessy at a funeral, a crossroads or a public function. In fairness to him, he always had time for me or to have a quiet word. I could ask for his opinion or advice. I am eternally grateful to him for that advice, his perspective and his insight, which he was more than willing to share with me. He had years of experience and a wealth of knowledge. It was great to be able to tap into them. Proper mention has been made of Peadar's late wife, Jean, who pre-deceased him. From my contacts with the Clohessy family, I know that she was an immense rock of support for Peadar throughout their marriage, their life together and his political career. It is only fitting that she has been mentioned today. In an obituary on Peadar written not long after his funeral, the headline in The Irish Times described him as a politician "who was committed to his native Limerick". This was true, but his overarching commitment was to his family - his sons, Andrew, Patrick and Michael, and his daughters, Alice, Margaret and Sinéad. Their loss is immense. However, I am sure that they are warmly comforted by the considerable depth of goodwill that exists and will live on for a long time because of the actions of Peadar Clohessy in carrying out his role as an outstanding public servant.

It is great to see so many of the family today. I am delighted to be a part of these expressions of sympathy to the late Peadar. I had a quick look back. Peadar was born in 1933. People referred to his connection with the GAA. He was born when Limerick hurling was coming out of the doldrums and just before a golden age. We won All-Irelands in 1934, 1936 and 1940. His uncle, the late Paddy Clohessy, played in all of those All-Irelands. I hope that, in 2014, Limerick will go on to take another hurling All-Ireland. Peadar had a fantastic career that spanned 25 years. In 1974, he was elected to Limerick County Council for the Castleconnell electoral area, which I also represented. He was in the local authority until 1999 and served as cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council between 1992 and 1993. Side by side with this work, he had an illustrious career as a Deputy for the old Limerick East constituency, which is now called Limerick City. He represented many of the people on my side of the county. Obviously, Fedamore was his native base. He represented Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats with distinction for a long time. As the Taoiseach stated, he was Whip for the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Chief Whip while that party was in government with Fianna Fáil. Furthermore, he was spokesman on marine and defence. He was an extremely approachable man and the epitome of the wise and simple man. He understood people's needs. Deputy Niall Collins referred to his late wife, Jean. From speaking with family members, I know that she was a central focus in the family. This crosses all political divides - the family plays a vital role. This is particularly so of spouses and partners. Matters are different now, but when Peadar was a Deputy and councillor, the work was based in the home. Constituents came to one's home. Family was extremely important. Peadar was synonymous with Des O'Malley. They went through all phases of their careers together and were a good combination. I pay tribute to the fantastic work that Peadar did for the people of Limerick. I also pay tribute to his late wife, Jean, and his family members, who are present. It is great to see his sons and daughters - Andrew, Patrick, Michael, Alice, Margaret and Sinéad - and, I do not doubt, some of his sisters and extended family. It is a proud moment for them. We in the national Parliament have the great privilege of being able to serve people. Peadar served the people of the country and, in particular, Limerick East with great distinction and I am delighted to be a part of this tribute.

I knew Peadar well. He was highly respected in Limerick. I was elected to the council in 1985, by which time he had served 11 years. I got to know him. He was an incisive contributor and spoke when he had something to say. Everyone listened when Peadar spoke. He was highly respected by the officials, staff and members of Limerick County Council during my time there. He was chair in 1992 and 1993 during its Fine Gael-Progressive Democrats coalition. He carried out that role with total objectivity and fairness. It was the highlight of his council career, as he loved the council and local politics. He may have had more time for local politics than national politics - when discussing matters with him, he always reverted to issues of local politics. He was elected to the Oireachtas in 1981 and I was elected in 1989. After that, I got to know him extremely well. He had a great affinity for and commitment to Limerick and his constituency's people. He also had a fantastic work ethic and output. I remember with fondness some chats that four of us who met over a drink used to have - Jim Kemmy, John Mulvihill, who was from Cork but a native of Shanagolden and who had worked at the docks there as a 14 year old, Peadar and me. We had great chats about Limerick, its hurling and politics. Peadar was a wise man and a great person to advise others on issues. As a green Member of the Oireachtas, I used to consult him on many issues during those discussions. I remember his great sense of humour and an attractive, husky laugh when he responded to a humorous statement. Above all, he had common sense and a commitment to Limerick, his family and his country. I am honoured to be able to pay tribute to the life and work of Peadar Clohessy and to offer my sincere sympathy to his children - Alice, Margaret, Sinéad, Andrew, Patrick and Michael - and his extended family.

Like some of the previous speakers, I did not have the pleasure of serving in the Dáil or on the local authority with Peadar, but I did have occasion to meet him at several Limerick County Council functions while I was a member. Once the decision was made to reconfigure the old Limerick East and Limerick West constituencies into Limerick City and Limerick, the rural part of Limerick East came into what is now the Limerick county constituency. I am sure my colleagues will agree that, whether it was in Fedamore, Bruff, Meanus, Cappamore or wherever, people had a great affinity for Peadar Clohessy's work, particularly in rural parts of the county. When canvassing on doorsteps in the rural part of east Limerick and mention was made of previous Deputies, it was always in a positive light that Peadar Clohessy was mentioned. I once met him with a predecessor of mine in the Dáil, former Deputy Michael Finucane.We spoke about the reconfigured Limerick East and Limerick West, which are now the county and the city constituencies. Peadar gave a summation of what he thought was likely to come out of the ballot boxes in 2011, and he was not far wrong. That proved his connection with and understanding of the electorate. Anybody who could take a seat in Limerick East on the eighth and twelfth counts, as he did in the early 1990s, showed how he was tuned into the single transferable vote. He would never walk away from a house without the promise of a No, 4, 5, 6 or 7 because being elected on the twelfth count proves that every vote one gets on the ballot paper is worth getting, and he epitomised that. I would like to sympathise with Peadar's sons, daughters and extended family. The greatest tribute that can be paid to people who gave their lives to public service is paid by their own people. I know that the people around Fedamore and rural east Limerick turned out in huge numbers to say goodbye to Peadar. One of the comments made by the Limerick Leader at the time was that Peadar Clohessy showed an unselfish public service, and any of us who can leave this House with that as our legacy will not be doing half bad.

Annette and Declan Coyle spoke movingly about it, and everybody who saw the programme could not believe what has happened. It would go through one's heart, Taoiseach, and I do not understand it. I am aware legislation has been published on one aspect of this but given the clear decision to eliminate discretionary medical cards it appears that some aspect of the legislation on universal primary care must be moved forward. It needs legislative change. I believe the 1970 Health Act provides for the award of discretionary medical cards. I do not agree with the Minister of State, Deputy White, on that. An attempt has been made, almost in a North Korean style, to write discretionary medical cards out of existence and say they never happened, there was never a legal basis for them, therefore, they should no longer exist. That is the narrative that is emerging. There is a legislative template but if the Taoiseach is not satisfied that is the case or he is concerned about it, why will he not bring in urgent amending legislation to ensure the provision of discretionary medical cards in cases such as that revealed on "The Saturday Night Show" and to children and adults with a terminal illness, particularly people with rare syndromes that, by definition, create enormous and multiple challenges for such children? It defies any rational explanation that we could not do that. Can the universal primary care Bill promised in the programme for Government be accelerated now with a view to making such a provision, and when will we see it?

There were 100,000 medical cards issued in 2013, 23,000 of which were discretionary cards. There are 40,000 medical cards issued for the first three months of this year. I have given the details previously of the discretionary cards that applied two years ago and their current status. It is not true to say that discretionary medical cards are being phased out.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	I ask the Taoiseach about the Government's position on the Narrow Water Bridge project. I understand he has said he is now committed to ensuring the project will go ahead to the next round of European Union funding. I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach many times. The project did not go ahead because of the Government's failure to provide the financial investment needed to supplement the funding from local councils and the European Union.The Taoiseach will be aware that this has the support of all of the parties in Louth, south Down and south Armagh and that the North-South Ministerial Council of last November stated its unanimous support for this worthy project. Perhaps the Taoiseach would update the House on this matter. Last July, the Taoiseach told me, and more important, the Dáil, that the Walsh report on symphysiotomy would be published soon. Almost a year later, there is still no sign of it. Last November, the Taoiseach appointed Judge Murphy to examine the issue of symphysiotomy and bring closure to the many women who have suffered this barbaric practice. It should be remembered that most of these women are very elderly. The Walsh report was to be completed within eight weeks. I have previously raised this issue with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions. In his absence prior to Easter I raised it with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, who told me he would come back to me on the matter. I then received a note saying that an update would be provided but none has been received. More important, no one, least of all the victims, is any the wiser. When will the Murphy report and, separately, the Walsh report into this cruel and totally unacceptable, sinister and evil practice of symphysiotomy be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	Deputy Adams knows that the reason Narrow Water Bridge did not proceed is not because the Government did not put up the funds but because of the scale of the difference between the tender and moneys provided under the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB and Newry, Mourne and Louth councils. As previously stated, I support this proposal and would like to keep it alive. The issue will be the subject of discussion at the June meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. I understand that the SEUPB programme is being redrafted and that it is expected the Narrow Water Bridge proposal will be resubmitted. I cannot confirm to the Deputy whether the same proposal will be resubmitted. Suffice it to say that I would like to see this happen and will support it. Obviously, the moneys previously available under the SEUPB were diverted to the rail line and a number of other issues. On the symphysiotomy report, Judge Murphy commenced her work in December last, which she estimated would take approximately eight weeks to complete and following which she would provide the Minister with a report and recommendations on the next step. The Minister has received that report but has yet to bring it before Government. Following this, the Government will make its decision on the next steps to be taken. This is an issue that has been around for a long time and needs to be dealt with quickly. Obviously, the survivors have had a very difficult time. I will come back to the Deputy on publication of the Walsh report.

Page 14 of the programme for Government reads "...to make greater use of mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage repayments, which is a better and cheaper option than paying rent supplement after a family loses their home". How does the Taoiseach reconcile this definitive commitment with the Government's action in abolishing mortgage supplement, which is what it is doing?

The nine-person commission as proposed in the Bill will come within the established structure of the Central Statistics Office, with the legislation in respect of the CSO being amended under this Bill. The CSO has the expertise and skills to complete the specific functions proposed. The commission will have a specific role in regularly informing the public about levels of wealth and income across Irish society. Data collection and compilation on income and wealth will be the starting point. The commission will engage in research on best practice models of income distribution and seek to determine an appropriate structure in which the awarding of executive high pay and other remuneration may be reformed. It will also have a role in supporting the development of economic and fiscal policy in a fairer manner. The Taoiseach will be aware that the genesis of this Bill is the efforts in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of myself and other Independent and Opposition Deputies to present alternative budgets to the budgets of cuts and grave austerity. We, and the bodies on which we were relying, including the TASC research organisation and the OECD, believe there is a huge dearth of information in relation to income levels and wealth in this State. The proposed high pay commission would help to plug this information deficit by way of compiling the information necessary. It is hoped this commission would play a key role in beginning to address the problems associated with high pay, including high levels of executive pay. Only last Friday, I urged the Government not to approve the €1.5 million pay and benefits package to the Aer Lingus CEO, Christoph Mueller. I was grateful the Government did not support those outrageous pension increases for a company struggling to address a huge deficit in its pension fund on behalf of its workers. We also learned in recent weeks that the top ten best paid Irish CEOs shared €67 million between them. In fact, two of them shared almost €30 million between them. These are outrageous levels of remuneration for people running, in some cases, relatively modest sized companies.This is at a time when young citizens are being forced to live on €5,000 per year. Lone parents are subject to progressive cuts to their incomes and elderly citizens have been subjected to terribly unfair cuts to home care packages, etc. Many hundreds of thousands of workers are living on the minimum wage, at €8.65 per hour, and often rely on very unjust zero-hour contracts. Many societies are very concerned about the significant and rising levels of income inequality. Economist Paul Krugman, for example, refers to the Luxembourg Income Study Centre, which shows that primary income and assets are very unequally distributed in nearly all countries. Several IMF studies have shown that reducing income inequality through redistributive methods does not necessarily hurt economic growth. The most talked about book on economics at present, which I am sure the Taoiseach is reading, is that of Professor Thomas Piketty, entitled "Capital in the Twenty-First Century". It makes a close study of the evolution of income and wealth in Europe in the past 300 years and covers the rise in wealth and income inequality, especially since the 1970s, and the Thatcherite governments. The associated ideology was promoted in this country by the Progressive Democrats, the Progressive Democrat Fianna Fáilers and, at times, the Taoiseach's own party. The book identifies the main driver of inequality as the tendency for the returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth. This is a central feature of capitalism and one of its great flaws. In the United Kingdom, there is the High Pay Centre. In Australia in 2009, there was a public inquiry into executive high pay. Exorbitant levels of high executive pay in Ireland have not been tackled in any serious way, either in policy or legislation. We have heard the outcries about massively high pay in voluntary bodies. We all tend to know what public servants earn. I include ourselves, or everybody who works in this Chamber. However, there is a considerable range associated with the territory of high pay and wealth. We need to establish the facts and the data. The Taoiseach is the man who famously said, "Paddy likes to know." Paddy and Patricia do not know regarding high income and high wealth. I propose that the high pay and wealth commission will engage in an executive pay project to establish a process whereby excessively high pay can be addressed at policy and legislative levels. Generating accurate information on the extent of high pay will be a key starting point for the commission. To some extent, this work has begun in a very tiny way, as the Taoiseach will probably know, in that the CSO was a member of the Household Finance and Consumption Network and is carrying out the household finance and consumption survey as part of its role. However, the survey is limited to only 5,000 households out of a couple of million. Introducing the Bill would be useful first step, therefore, as it would provide the basic data and information we need to formulate public and taxation policy.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	I am very pleased to address the House today at the start of Europe Week and the start of a significant few months for the European Union, its citizens and its institutions. By the end of this month, a new European Parliament will have been elected. Later this year, we will choose new presidents for the European Council and the European Commission, and a new College of Commissioners will be appointed. This month ten years ago, under an Irish Presidency the European Union celebrated its biggest ever enlargement. Ten member states - Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - joined on 1 May 2004. Bulgaria and Romania joined shortly afterwards. They have each contributed greatly to the Union since then, and we have been mutually enriched by their membership. More recently, we have welcomed Croatia to our European family. We in Ireland have had a particularly positive experience of strengthening our relations with the newer member states, including through the welcome presence here of many of their nationals. Over the past ten years, the number of EU member states has almost doubled, from 15 to 28, and this is a testament to the enduring attraction of EU membership and our shared commitment to working together for the mutual benefit of our citizens and nations. In the past few years, the Union has faced what is perhaps the most serious economic crisis since its foundation. Together and individually, the Union and its member states have acted to confront this challenge; we have taken significant and, at times, painful measures but we have made progress. While there is still a way to travel, the Union and its member states are beginning to emerge stronger, more resilient and more confident. The Union today faces another great challenge, albeit of a very different type. Events in Ukraine represent a serious threat to the hard-won security and stability of Europe, and to the still-fragile economic recovery. EU leaders continue to work together to support the Ukrainian Government and people, to act against those responsible and to bring about an early and a peaceful resolution. This Government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and has emphasised the importance of seeking a negotiated political settlement. However, we are also ready to take decisive action, if required. The European Council has addressed this issue twice in the past two months, and it remains at the very top of the agenda. The challenge the situation in Ukraine presents is not just to our interests, but, more fundamentally, to our common EU values. Our Union is founded on respect for the rule of law, in international relations as well as in our internal affairs. We cannot celebrate Europe Day and all that Europe stands for while at the same time simply acquiescing in the illegal annexation of the territory of a European country. Our European values - democracy, respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law - demand more from us than that. We must not forget why we came together as a union and what we stand for. The Union touches the daily lives of most EU citizens, including the Irish, most closely in the manner it effects their economic and social well-being. I refer to the familiar trio of jobs, growth and stability. Recently, both the domestic and EU economy showed signs that recovery is beginning to take hold. Significant challenges remain, however. Supporting recovery remains a key policy focus for both Ireland and the Union. In particular, we must ensure recovery brings jobs, and therefore that employment remains one of the key priorities of the European semester process. The European Council will complete next month the 2014 European semester process when it signs off on the country-specific recommendations for each member state, including Ireland, this year. We can expect employment to be front and centre here. At the end of last year, the Government published its medium-term economic strategy to 2020, which complements efforts at European level such as the guidance given by the March European Council as part of the semester process. The indicators for Irish GDP growth, Irish public finances and Irish employment growth are all moving in the right direction. The unemployment rate, for example, is projected to average 11.5 % this year. Of course, this is still far too high, and we will continue to spare no effort to redress that situation. As the House knows well, last December Ireland exited its EU-IMF programme and did so without the assistance of a precautionary credit facility. It was able to exit without a credit facility thanks in the main to our steadfast programme implementation, the continuing support of our EU partners and the acceptance of the challenge by our people.Modest, but still important, growth is forecast for the EU and eurozone in 2014, and this is expected to strengthen further in 2015. A slight rise in employment is forecast from this year onwards, with unemployment falling to 10.4% in the European Union and 11.7% in the euro area by 2015. In 2014 deficits are set to fall to 2.7% of GDP in the European Union and 2.6% in the euro area. Developments in Portugal and Greece provide further encouraging evidence of recovery. Later this month Portugal will exit its EU-IMF programme and indications are that, like Ireland, it will do so without a precautionary credit facility. Last month Greece returned to the markets for the first time in four years, raising €3 billion on foot of bids exceeding €20 billion. The reductions in bond yields for countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain in recent months confirm that our economies are on the right track. Real progress has been made in completing banking union, the key to ensuring there will be no repeat of the economic and financial crisis. From November the Single Supervisory Mechanism will assume responsibility for the 120 most significant institutions and the Single Resolution Mechanism will enter into force from 1 January 2015. The effect of these will be that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers’ money. Progress has also been made since last year on direct bank recapitalisation and I remain confident that the commitment made by the euro area Heads of State and Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. My colleagues and I on the European Council are adamant that sustaining the economic recovery remains the key priority. The conclusions of the March European Council focused on the economy and I expect those of the June Council to maintain this focus. However, we also addressed other vitally important issues. A secure, sustainable and affordable energy supply is an essential requirement for citizens and businesses. The March European Council called for urgent work on fair effort sharing, modernising the energy sector, prevention of carbon leakage and an energy efficiency framework. We also agreed to accelerate efforts to complete the internal energy market this year, including through increased electricity interconnections, and launched a process to reach agreement on the 2030 climate change and energy framework by October. Energy security has become more urgent given developments in Ukraine. My colleagues and I on the European Council will be tackling this issue and the difficult decisions that come with it in the months ahead. Ireland and the European Union have travelled far since the Dáil marked Europe Week this time last year. Since last May, we completed our successful and well received Presidency. We successfully completed and exited our EU-IMF programme. We re-established our standing and influence in Europe. We worked hard and long with our partners in Europe to meet the challenges facing citizens. While we have achieved much together in the last 12 months, we recognise the scale and seriousness of the challenges still facing us. Some of these challenges, like the crisis in Ukraine, would not have been foreseen this time last year. Others, like climate change and energy, are growing in priority and urgency. Still others such as fighting unemployment and strengthening Economic and Monetary Union have been and continue to be the focus of determined efforts on all our parts. Of course, in the year ahead we must continue to work together to build on what we have achieved and implement what we have agreed. I look forward to updating the House in that regard in the months ahead. However, we should also take the opportunity of Europe Week to look beyond the challenges and consider what has brought us together. The European Union’s 28 member states and 504 million people are bound together by shared interests, shared values and a shared future. Together, we are clearly more than the sum of our parts and together we will make the continent and our world a better place. The European Union is a force for good and the Government is proud to be among its most committed supporters.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House in Europe Week in what is, undoubtedly, an important year for the European Union. This is a time of transition in Europe and, as we put the crisis behind us, we need to look ahead at the challenges that remain. As the Taoiseach and many commentators have noted, we again find ourselves in a time of institutional change. A new European Parliament will be elected this month, to be followed by the appointment of a new President of the European Commission and a new college of Commissioners. There will also be a new President of the European Council and a successor to Catherine Ashton as High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. These changes have growing significance for us all because of the enhanced roles of the European institutions and our ever-increasing interdependence within the European Union and the euro area. While much of the focus in recent years, since the advent of the recession, has been internal, recent events on Europe’s borders have served as a stark reminder of the necessity in a fast-changing, multi-polar and often unpredictable world for the Union to act in unison and speak with one voice. The European Union strongly supports the international rules-based system founded on the principles of human rights, justice and respect for international law. This rules-based order is our best guarantee of stability, security and prosperity. What happens beyond our borders can and does directly affect us in Europe, as the crisis in Ukraine clearly demonstrates. The Taoiseach has spoken about the importance of seeking a negotiated political settlement to the crisis in Ukraine. To that end, the Government strongly supports High Representative Ashton’s call on all parties to the joint Geneva statement of 17 April to ensure its terms are fully implemented, including by using their leverage on illegal armed groups to stop violence and provocation and make them hand in their arms. The European Union will continue to be actively engaged in international efforts to facilitate a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis, supporting initiatives involving the United Nations, the OSCE and others to that end. At its meeting on 14 April the Foreign Affairs Council expressed strong support for the holding of free and fair presidential elections on 25 May. Ireland is sending a team of observers to Ukraine to help achieve that objective, one which will allow the Ukrainian people to determine their own future and help to build trust and confidence across the country. It is in the interests of the entire region that a sovereign, prosperous, stable, democratic and inclusive Ukraine emerges from the current crisis. Events in Ukraine remind us of the core achievement of the European Union in creating a stable, democratic and prosperous Europe. We have achieved this by working together in a spirit of mutual co-operation and solidarity, putting ancient enmities behind us. Throughout the crisis, member states and the shared institutions we have created worked together to restore stability. It was not easy and many critics predicted failure, but the European Union has come through stronger and better equipped to meet the challenges of the future. This includes real progress towards banking union, reflecting agreement on what is necessary for both restoring normal flows of lending to the real economy and ensuring there will be no repeat of the current crisis. The Single Supervisory Mechanism will take effect from the beginning of November, followed by the Single Resolution Mechanism from the beginning of 2015. The European Semester will also play a crucial role in strengthening co-ordination of national economic and budgetary policies towards the overarching objective of supporting growth and jobs. It is clear that economic conditions across Europe are improving. Last year saw GDP in both the European Union and euro area back in positive territory for the first time since late 2011. Many member states, including Ireland, have returned to net job creation and this year will see a return to net employment growth for the European Union as a whole. However, unemployment remains unacceptably high at around 11% for the European Union and 12% for the euro area. This is at the heart of the growth in support for those parties which reject Europe without plausibly explaining how member states confronting recession, climate change and the need to trade freely within each other’s markets and with the wider world on a fair basis could do better in acting alone. This is not to deny the challenge, namely, that there is more we can and must do to support a stronger, EU-wide recovery in the period ahead. This means unlocking a new wave of investment for job creation and growth.The recent spring European Council took stock of the Europe 2020 strategy. Europe 2020 is the EU strategy to support growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive. It is focused on five targets - employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion. These are translated into specific goals for each member state and progress is monitored annually. It is clear that Europe's performance against these objectives is mixed and has been overshadowed by our need to respond to the crisis. This is the right time to develop a strong re-engagement with Europe's post-crisis growth strategy, on which a full public consultation will happen in the coming months. When Commission Secretary General Catherine Day met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in January, she emphasised the importance of strong stakeholder engagement with this renewal of the Europe 2020 strategy, including, of course, from national parliaments. Work in this area will be supported by pressing forward on the Single Market and external trade agendas, restoring normal lending conditions through a fit-for-purpose financial sector, creating stronger business networks around our research and development investments and ensuring the supply of skills is aligned with what the market needs. At the same time, we have to ensure the European Union is doing things right and doing the right things. That is why new steps in the area of regulatory fitness are so important - withdrawing unnecessary proposals, simplifying what is already in place and repealing what is out of date. This is an issue to which the European Council will return in June. The European Investment Bank will play a key role in supporting the new wave of investments needed to deepen the economic recovery under way. This €10 billion increase in its capital base - agreed to as part of the Compact for Growth and Jobs - will support a 40% increase in its lending capacity in the period 2013-15, bringing annual EIB lending volumes to between €65 and €70 billion. There was almost €1.2 billion worth of EIB project signatures and loan approvals in Ireland in 2013 - double what was approved two years ago. I see room for continued and strengthened EIB support, including in the area of access to finance for SMEs. This will remain a top priority for us in the coming months, including the establishment of a dedicated initiative to assist with the provision of finance for exporting SMEs, as provided for in budget 2014. While creating the right conditions for new job creation across Europe, we must also equip young people with the skills needed to fill them. It is clear that there is a shared challenge across developed economies in adapting the education and training systems to the reality of the 21st century. That is why getting agreement on the key principles of youth guarantee schemes ranks among the most important achievements of last year's Irish Presidency. We finalised our own initial youth guarantee implementation plan in December and published it at the end of January. It will be a phased roll-out initially, targeting those at greatest risk of long-term unemployment. When fully rolled out, all young people will receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. We have also set a clear path for returning the economy to full employment through the medium-term economic strategy produced in December.  Over 60 years ago Robert Schuman recognised that Europe would not be made all at once or according to a single plan; rather, it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The events of the past six years, as much as those of the past six decades, surely prove his wisdom and prescience. His early insight remains no less relevant today and can continue to guide our shared efforts in the coming months and years.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	Commemorating the Schuman Declaration through Europe Day is rightly focused on stepping away from the day-to-day debates on policy proposals. It is an invitation to us all to look instead at the bigger picture, the fundamental achievements and directions of what remains the most successful inter-state organisation in history. The European Union has many failings, but they come nowhere near outweighing the positive contribution it has made to a continent which was once defined by near-permanent conflict and widespread poverty. It has enabled rising standards of living which would have been impossible if every member state had stood alone. The Union's critics are fully entitled to criticise it, but, equally, they undermine their own arguments when they refuse to acknowledge the sustained progress in many areas enabled by it. The events in Ukraine should concern us all. The people of Ukraine want to live in an independent democracy. They have repeatedly been let down by their leaders and are now facing a conflict directly fomented by a former imperial power which does not recognise the right of Ukraine to be a sovereign and genuinely independent state. Ukraine has already been partitioned by Russia which has actively encouraged the Russian-speaking population in the east of Ukraine to stand against the majority. Europe has a moral duty to stand against this aggression and the idea that one state can partition another in this way. On this island, we have seen that encouraging divisions does immeasurable long-term damage. Further significant sanctions are becoming both reasonable and, unfortunately, inevitable.  I pay tribute to the Irish personnel who have participated in the work of the OSCE in Ukraine and elsewhere. They are a reminder that Ireland continues to build on its proud record of promoting the peaceful reconciliation of disputes. They also disprove the myth that Europe is or wants to be an aggressive military superpower. It continues to respect the neutrality of member states which do not want to participate in a military alliance and enables these states to better participate in tasks associated with preventing conflicts and protecting human rights. In many of our debates on European issues there can be a real imbalance. We hear a defence of whatever has been agreed to by leaders sitting in the Council and then attacks on everything they have and have not done. There is a false division at the heart of debate whereby there is an expectation that one must defend or oppose Europe, with little room in the centre ground. As I have said in a series of lengthy policy statements on Europe, my party believes there must be a space for "critical friends" – those who are absolute in their belief in the idea of a union of European states but who reserve the right to criticise the decisions and directions set by its leaders.  For the past six years the European Union has experienced what is by far the biggest crisis in its history. The economic and financial crises have been added to by a political crisis. While there are welcome signs that Europe's economy is recovering and that stability has returned to its financial system, major concerns remain. Core flaws in the design of Economic and Monetary Union have not been addressed and the new banking union is incomplete and insufficient. Growth forecasts suggest unemployment will remain high, with youth unemployment stuck at a level which will directly lead to long-term social problems. In spite of this, the leaders of the Union, especially the Heads of State and Government who meet in the Council, are expressing their satisfaction with how things have developed. They continue to show a lack of ambition or urgency.  The only person in a leadership role who has risen to the crisis is Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. He assumed his current position more by accident than design. It was part of closed negotiations between a few larger states. The Taoiseach admitted here in 2011 that he had not even talked to Mr. Draghi and did not know his views before agreeing to his appointment. In spite of this, President Draghi has implemented changes in policy which are the direct and primary reasons the sovereign debt crisis has eased and some growth has returned to Ireland and the eurozone. It is a pity that the need of governments such as our own to promote themselves means that they have failed to acknowledge the central role of one EU institution in helping member states. Of course, the political approach of the Government also means that it has not acknowledged the central role of failed and now abandoned EU policies in Ireland requiring the troika's support. The success of President Draghi's policies has been confirmed in recent days by the exit of Portugal from its support programme on 17 May 2014, the return of Greece to the debt markets and the low borrowing rates faced by Spain and others who were on the edge of requiring support. The Government recently deployed its spin machine to manipulate an OECD report on its jobs plan. It ignored two very important statements in the report which undermined the Government's spin. First, it stated there was no direct evidence of the link between the plan and the jobs which the Government was claiming to have delivered. Second, more importantly, it stated there was direct evidence that the jobs being created were linked to improved economic conditions in Europe.It is a pity the Government's eagerness to promote itself is getting in the way of acknowledging how central EU recovery has been to our own. This is not to say the ECB's policies are all what they should be. It remains the case that Ireland has not received full justice. Greece receives the profits from ECB holdings of its bonds and Ireland should do so, too. In addition, there is the issue of conversion of the promissory notes into bonds held by the Central Bank of Ireland. From the moment the deal was announced I pointed out that the Central Bank of Ireland should be allowed to hold them to maturity because selling them early would cost us billions and wipe out the entire benefit of the deal to Ireland. The Taoiseach has repeatedly dismissed concerns others and I have raised on this issue, but the evidence is incontrovertible that there is pressure on the Central Bank of Ireland to sell them early. It is long past time for the Government to state this would be unacceptable. While the situation with the economic and financial crises facing the European Union is undeniably better, the political crisis is getting worse. In most countries parties and individuals promoting anti-EU sentiments, frequently in an ugly populist way, are doing well. The extremes of the right and the left are united against the European Union and in challenging them there has been no strong political leadership. In fact, many leaders have indulged anti-EU sentiment rather than confronted it. The decision of the British Conservative Party to seek a renegotiation of the United Kingdom's membership as a prelude to an in-out referendum is hugely significant for Ireland. Even though their review of competencies is disproving anti-EU arguments, the destructive and negative debate which is mostly confined to England continues. Ireland and others need to make their positions clear - we should never support the agenda of hollowing-out the European Union and reducing it to a free trade zone. It is only a union which invests in its regions, supports equality, demands decent working conditions and protects its citizens which benefits Ireland. We must not stand on the side lines when these fundamental issues are being debated. We must not allow the Tories to believe they can gain all of the benefits of access to the European market, with none of the responsibilities of common standards. We must stand against the race to the bottom and in favour of the vision of a Europe which sees economic development as an enabler of social progress. If we have learned one thing in recent years it should be that progress in Europe is not something that is inevitable - it must be worked for. The vision set out in the Schuman Declaration 64 years ago is as relevant today as it ever has been. What is missing is the leadership to act on that vision.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	I begin by apologising for the absence of my colleague, Deputy Gerry Adams.  This Friday, 9 May, marks the EU celebration of Europe Day. It marks the date of the Schuman Declaration in 1950 which proposed the pooling of French and West German coal and steel industries and which led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. The people of this state voted to join what was then the European Economic Community on 10 May 1972. Two weeks after Europe Day, on 23 May, Irish people will enter polling stations and decide who they want to represent their interests in the European Parliament. As with the last election, the feeling being expressed on the door step is that the people want change. Some say they are tired of our representatives being bullied and blindly submitting to the wishes of the bigger EU countries. It is most worrying that many do not appear to even know who their MEPs are. That is part of the disconnect and difficulty we need to overcome. Irish people are fed-up with the continuation of EU-enforced austerity policies, while the Government and its MEPs continue to vote for and champion these crippling policies. The electorate was promised seismic shifts and game changing deals on banking debt, both inside and outside the House. They were told that this would mean the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt and that in future bank crises the ESM would directly recapitalise banks and that the sovereign would not be expected to take on a bank bailout. An tUachtarán Higgins has said on numerous occasions that there is a flaw in the economic model and the social and political mores of EU leaders, but the Government and its MEPs continue to champion them. Voters across the island have a real choice on 23 May between sitting MEPs who have supported the European institution's austerity policies at every turn or Sinn Féin candidates who have consistently set out a real political, economic and social alternative. I believe the people of Ireland need to send a strong and clear message about their desire for change on 23 May. Sinn Féin's policies towards the European Union have always been focused on critical engagement. Where measures are in the interests of the Irish people and the peoples of Europe, we support them and seek to further them. However, where they are not in the interests of the people, we have opposed them and campaigned to change them. We want to work with everyone to create an inclusive Europe which reflects the needs and aspirations of all its peoples, not just the few. We will not, however, support a drive for further centralisation of powers in the hands of an unelected EU bureaucracy. Irish citizens do not want to live in a province of a European super-state in which technocrats take decisions with no accountability. Sinn Féin has been consistently critical of the European project's federalist character and the profound lack of democracy at its core. We do not support a European Union in which a small number of large member states take it upon themselves to dictate economic, security or other policy to smaller states. I know that, if elected, Sinn Féin's EU election candidates will work to secure EU investment for job creation, a deal on legacy banking debt, a real alternative to austerity, the protection of workers' pay and conditions, action on climate change, Irish neutrality and promote Irish unity and EU support for a Border poll. We support a Europe of equals, a social Union in which all states act together in common cause and interest. The European project was created to build solidarity between European countries and avoid continued inter-state violence and war. Europe directly experienced two World Wars, the carpet bombing of civilian areas, the flattening of towns and cities, with whole communities nearly wiped out through genocide, fascism and division, yet we moved beyond this towards reconciliation. EU countries may not be facing the threat of fighting each other, but we are seeing the unemployment, homelessness, emigration and food queues that are reminiscent of those dark days. There is a growing awareness that cutting expenditure and increasing taxes will not get the European Union out of this disastrous financial position. The European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, reported that the incidence of poverty in the European Union had increased by over 6 million since 2010 to 124.5 million people, despite the target being to reduce it by at least 20 million by 2020. What is needed is a focus on job creation, growth and protecting the most vulnerable in our societies. Unilateral austerity will continue to drive the European Union into a destabilising abyss from which it might never recover. As the European Union faces into the heart of this crisis, what we need is greater solidarity between EU citizens, not the strong versus the weak model being promoted. As we approach Europe Day, it is extremely important that we do not forget about the escalating crisis in Ukraine where the situation has gone from bad to worse. Incidents in the past week signal that it may be sliding into civil war. The violence and instability have drastically spread from eastern Ukraine to other parts of the country. On Friday 42 protesters were killed in the multi-ethnic south-western Black Sea port city of Odessa after clashes between pro-Russian and pro-EU groups. This included the murder of 38 pro-Russian protesters by - according to media reports- extreme right-wing Ukrainian nationalists when the trade union building in which they were taking shelter was torched. The last seven days have been the deadliest since the separatist uprising began and have transformed the conflict by hardening positions and reducing the room for peace. As we remember Europe Day and how Europe came together from the ashes of the Second World War to rebuild and revitalise itself through peace, solidarity and co-operation, we must also remember Ukraine.The geopolitical posturing and advances for self-interest by the European Union and Russia in Ukraine must stop now. It sounds simplistic, but a radical change in approach which places Ukrainians at the heart of their future political and economic decision-making, free from outside pressure and intimidation, is the only way to ensure peace and stability will return to Ukraine. This Friday, 9 May, marks the celebration of Europe Day. There will be celebrations in some parts of Europe, although I do not know how much celebrating there will be in this part of the world. The celebration of Europe Day has never really been on my agenda, but there have been hugely positive gains from being involved in the European Union. Given its historical background, it can play a major and positive role in trying to bring about peace and reconciliation around the world. That is the direction many people in Ireland, particularly after the conflict we have been through, want to see the European Union taking. They want to see it moving forward and member states working together in solidarity to try to bring peace, stability and economic prosperity to peoples around the world.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	Yes. Today in Brussels Finance Ministers are discussing the financial transaction tax. Eleven EU countries seem intent on signing up to it, including two of the biggest member states, France and Germany, as well as two of the bailout programme countries, Portugal and Greece. I am disappointed that Ireland is not doing the same. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has argued on several occasions that the introduction of a financial transaction tax could displace financial sector activity. However, little concrete evidence has been brought forward to support this assertion. As UK researchers have highlighted, financial companies still enjoy considerable tax advantages in Ireland. The financial transaction tax would only be levied on a part of their activities. When it is considered that the tax on 1 million derivative trades would come to only €100, it is hard to see how this would undermine an entire sector.  Given that the financial sector played a major role in creating the economic crisis and the massive socialisation of private debt that has taken place in recent years, there is strong support across Europe and elsewhere internationally for moves that would force the financial sector to make a fair contribution to economic recovery. In addition, as the European Commission has pointed out, the sector is under-taxed in comparison to other sectors. The many benefits of a financial transaction tax include the fact that it would reduce the volume of high risk financial transactions and, therefore, help to prevent future crises. It would also help countries to monitor their financial sectors in a better fashion. As we, unfortunately, know, governments and state agencies had little insight into the scale and nature of financial transactions as the 2008 financial crisis unfolded. This lack of information inhibited a comprehensive response to the crisis. A financial transaction tax would also level the playing field for JobBridge SMEs which are not exempt from VAT. This exemption means that the financial sector enjoys preferential treatment over other sectors of the economy. This is a questionable policy decision, given how important the SME sector is in terms of employment. Over three quarters of the population are still involved in the SME sector, despite the difficulties it is going through.  An interesting article by Mr. Chris Huhne was published in The Guardian last week. Mr. Huhne is a former Liberal Democrat Cabinet Minister in the United Kingdom who had to resign because he had passed on a couple of penalty points to his wife. For some strange reason, the English do accountability. It has been proved today that the Minister for Justice and Equality broke the law, but everyone seems to be okay with it. Seemingly, we do not have a problem with it here. Mr. Huhne's article focuses on the French author Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the Twenty-First Century. I have only read an analysis of the book to date, but it is very interesting. In the book Mr. Piketty challenges the conventional post-war view that capitalism was developing in a balanced way such that growth would float all boats. This complacent assumption was true in the post-war reconstruction period but only as a consequence of war and policies adopted to cope with the shocks of war. The physical destruction of wealth by war was followed by a further destruction of private wealth, as governments reduced their own war debts through inflation. Mr. Piketty has revived Marx's belief that capital would accumulate and become concentrated in ever fewer hands. Mr. Piketty, arguably one of the world's leading experts on tax and wealth, bases his argument on an analysis of wealth dating back two centuries and tax statistics in many countries dating back to the first progressive income tax under a Liberal Government in Britain in 1909. He says, "There is no natural spontaneous process to prevent destabilising, inegalitarian forces from prevailing permanently." He shows that in rich countries, at the frontier of technology and skills, the growth of incomes has been between 1% and 2% a year. Meanwhile, the rate of return on capital averages at about 4% to 5% a year. Therefore, those who draw their income from capital returns will outstrip wage earners and inherited wealth grows faster than output and income. That same philosophy is something about which the Government should think. Part of the housing crisis is related to the fact that people were allowed to accumulate incredible profits on the sale of land. Only a handful of people controlled most of the development in Dublin city, which, sadly, is still true today. In 1974 the Kenny report recommended that the price of development land only be allowed to rise a certain percentage above the price of agricultural land. It would make a lot of sense for the Government to bring forward such a measure.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	When I first saw this item on the agenda, it was entitled, Statements on Europe Day, but now I see it has been amended to read, "Statements on Europe Week". I notice that two Europe Days are being celebrated this week. The Council of Europe marks Europe Day on 5 May. The Council of Europe is an international organisation that promotes co-operation between all the countries of Europe in the areas of legal standards, human rights, democratic development, the rule of law and cultural co-operation. Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, with over 800 million citizens participating in it. We should celebrate Europe Day on 5 May. This House should be lauding that day because the Council of Europe has meant a lot to this country. It has allowed citizens whose court cases failed in this state to go to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, for redress. The ECHR is an institution of the Council of Europe, not the European Union, as a lot of Irish people seem to mistakenly consider it to be. Many politicians like to allow Irish people to continue to think along these lines. People have been able to have their rights vindicated in the ECHR which has had a huge impact on our national laws, most recently in the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill which arose from an ECHR ruling, not from a ruling of the European Union. The other Europe Day being celebrated this week and, unfortunately, the one this House wants to celebrate and commend is Friday, 9 May. It commemorates the 1950 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. When it was introduced, Jean Monnet said it was the first step in the federation of Europe. It is unfortunate that we are celebrating it in the House. The federation of Europe started in 1950 with the European Coal and Steel Community between Germany, France and the Benelux countries. It has proceeded through Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community, as it was in 1973, and the formation of the European Union. In 2007 European Commission President Barroso said, "... I like to compare the EU, as a creation, to the organisation of empire. We have the dimensions of empire." That is the project on which the European Union has embarked. It is the project into which successive Irish Governments and all of the major Irish political parties like to lead the people, blindfolded. In today's contributions, rather than looking at the overall direction of Europe, we hear talk about recovery from the crisis and what the next European Council will do. It is stuff that would put the average Irish person to sleep. Their eyes glaze over when they hear Europe being mentioned because it is so mundane and drawn out that they are not interested.The result is that there is no discussion of the direction Europe is taking, where the process will end and where Europe wants to see it end. The end of the process is a fiscal union, a federation of European states and a united states of Europe. That is the project in which we are participating and the one into which the Government and its predecessors have tried to lead the people blindfolded and asleep by stifling discussion about the overall direction of Europe. We have seen it recently with the crisis in Ukraine where the European Union facilitated and encouraged the overthrow of an elected government and supported fascist participation in the interim administration. That crisis will now be used to further develop the military aspirations of the European Union. We have even heard, on 14 April, Catherine Ashton ask European Ministers that if Ukraine is not a trigger to get serious about spending, pooling, sharing and smart defence, what more do we need to get real. That is the agenda - the militarisation of the European Union - Catherine Ashton, the Commission, the large member states and the Government want to see pursued to provide us with all the trappings of empire. As Angela Merkel wished for in 2010, we could even have a European army in the future. These are the issues we should be discussing in the context of the overall direction of the European Union when we discuss Europe Day and Europe Week, a celebration of the Schuman Declaration of 1950. I hope we will some day have a discussion in the House on the Council of Europe's Europe Day which would be something in which we could all participate.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	This year Europe Week is at a significant juncture, falling in the middle of the campaign for the European elections which will take place throughout the European Union between 20 and 23 May. Campaigns are well under way. While it may be tempting for some to sell the election as an opportunity to cast a protest vote on domestic policies, to do so is disingenuous and a wasted opportunity. The election is about European issues and the next five years in the European Union. It is not about domestic policies or politics today. Citizens need strong representation at European level. We elect our MEPs to represent us in the increasingly relevant and powerful European Parliament. Many of us will remember when the Parliament was not as powerful as it is today. It is very powerful today and becoming more so, in which regard it is important to elect MEPs who can adopt positions on proposed European policies and legislation on our behalf with the governments of the member states which are represented on the Council. MEPs play a vital role in connecting citizens directly to the European Union. The importance of the European Parliament is clear when we reflect on the parliamentary term which has just gone by. During the term of office of MEPs from 2009 to 2014, they have been legislating on our behalf in key areas directly relevant to Irish citizens, including the creation of a banking union to ensure taxpayers' money is never again used to bail out the banking system. The European Parliament was instrumental in bringing about a youth guarantee for young unemployed people in Europe and securing additional funding for the scheme. During the parliamentary term which will run until 2019 it is likely that we will see some proposals emerge for changes to the existing treaties. We will almost certainly see more significant changes for those countries that share the single currency, the euro, particularly in relation to the further development of an economic and fiscal union. Crucially for Ireland, the question of the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union will be addressed during this period. A great deal is at stake in the next five years. To ensure we have sufficient democratic legitimacy and accountability in the European Union, we first need a strong European Parliament with a strong mandate working on behalf of citizens and capable of holding the European Commission to account. So too at national level, we must ensure the Oireachtas is fully equipped to play a full role in the scrutiny of draft European legislation and to hold the Government to account for the decisions it takes at European level through the Council. In this regard, I welcome the Government's review of Oireachtas structures for the scrutiny of EU proposals which the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donoghoe, is leading. The European Union remains central to the achievement of Ireland's domestic and foreign policy objectives, the promotion of our values and interests and peace and prosperity throughout Europe. There is no doubt that the Union has become more complex in recent years. I am pleased that the review of Ireland's foreign policy and external relations being led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is examining how Ireland engages in the European Union. The review will be critical to ensuring Ireland has the right strategic approach in place to maximise its contribution to and benefit from the European Union. Critical to the achievement of policy objectives in the future will be increased Oireachtas engagement in political dialogue with the European Commission and in dialogue and co-operation with the European Parliament and other national parliaments. I see the respective roles of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the Euorpean Union as distinct and complementary. It will be important to build on this dimension once the newly elected European Parliament is in place. We must strive to make better use of our MEPs to increase their visibility and better integrate them into the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for continuous dialogue and feedback. Last week I had the opportunity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to attend a parliamentary conference in Riga, Latvia, to mark on 1 May the tenth anniversary of Latvia's accession to the European Union. On that occasion I shared some of Ireland's experiences of EU membership over 41 years and learned of Latvia's experiences in the past ten years. Despite the different time spans, the number of shared experiences was striking. There was experience of an economic boom, followed by a property bubble and severe contraction in the economy, leading to high levels of emigration. All contributors at the conference were in agreement that the experience and destiny of countries within the European Union rested largely in the hands of each member state. It is for each country to maximise its contribution to the Union and thereby reap the political and societal rewards that membership offers. While Ireland has successfully managed the process to date, it is one we must renew our commitment to on a continuous basis to secure our interests in an ever more complex Union. This year Europe Week provides us with an opportunity to look ahead to the next five year period and the further development of the European Union in that time. The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs set out in February its work programme for the year, flagging the main pieces of work it intended to progress. Since the beginning of 2014, we have contributed to the Government's review of foreign policy and the review of structures for the Oireachtas scrutiny of European matters. Reports have been prepared on both reviews. The joint committee is considering the issue of voting rights for Irish citizens who have exercised the right to live and work in another EU country and we will be preparing a report on the issue following the conclusion of a number of hearings in the coming weeks. This comes on foot of a recommendation from the European Commission in January that Ireland do more to ensure its citizens were not disenfranchised when exercising a right they enjoyed under the EU treaties, the free movement of persons. The joint committee is also looking at Economic and Monetary Union and what it might mean for Ireland, with a particular focus on democratic legitimacy and accountability. The committee will review the new rule of law mechanism for the European Union which the Commission put forward earlier this year. It will also look in greater depth at the implications for Ireland of a possible changed relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. As always, the committee will continue to build on its bilateral and multilateral engagements with our counterparts in national parliaments throughout the European Union. The national committees will foster better relationships and inform each other of EU scrutiny activities and the views of our respective parliaments on key matters. We will meet again in Athens in June with the other member state committees as part of the COSAC meetings. We will also use the opportunity to meet our colleagues in Albania and Montenegro.As the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, knows, the issue of enlargement, particularly concerning the former Yugoslavian countries, is high on the agenda of the committee. The committee has a full agenda and is keen to be fully engaged in European issues through scrutiny and examination of proposals and bilateral and multilateral relationships. We look forward to continuing to do so.

I will respond to each in turn and offer some views on the points made. Before doing so, I want to frame the debate with figures that provide the backdrop to the discussion and some of the challenges Europe and Ireland will face together in the years to come. The first concerns Europe's share of the world's population. At the beginning of 1900 Europe represented nearly one quarter of the population of the world. Currently, it represents 12% of the global population and by 2050 it will represent 7%. In the economic context, depending on how it is measured, Europe represents four or five of the ten largest economies in the world. By 2050, based on current trends and a degree of judgment, it will have two of the ten largest economies in the world. We will, therefore, see a large shift in Europe's share of the world's population and wealth. Much of the change will happen for positive reasons. It will happen because purchasing power in other countries and regions is beginning to change and develop. Europe and Ireland have invested in and supported strongly the development of these changes. Much of the development is due to the fact that the rest of the world is getting healthier, as demographics change, and Europe's place in the world will change from where it has been historically, let alone from where it is now. I offer these figures to colleagues to give a brief sketch of the change likely to take place across the world in our lifetimes, let alone the lifetimes of generations to come. This will offer major opportunities and pose major challenges to Ireland. We are very much aware of the acute challenges faced in the past five or six years in response to the major changes taking place at such speed within the European and global economies and Ireland. Due to the shifts outlined, many of which will happen for positive reasons such as the changes in demographics and technology and positive developments in other economies, there will be equal, if not greater, challenges in the period to come. I emphasise these changes because they offer a new rationale for the benefits of the European Union. They offer a practical benefit in supporting the level of integration, while being open to thinking about what will happen in the future. In the face of the changes mentioned, which provide the backdrop to the changes outlined by Deputies, given the scale of the challenges and the opportunities, the only way any country in Europe, no matter how small or big it is, can respond is by working with others and sharing the challenges and opportunities we face collectively and taking advantage of or rising to them. In a number of my contributions in the Dáil and elsewhere during my months in office, I have pointed out that all roads lead to that point and the question of how countries like Ireland respond to these opportunities, given their scale. The best vehicle for us to respond is through the European Union. The strongest rationale for supporting strong participation in the European project is a national one. On its own, Ireland could do very well in the face of the changes I have outlined, but it can do even better based on how we work with our neighbours. The European Union offers the best way of coming up with that model and mode of co-operation. Despite the challenges the Union has faced in recent years, if it did not exist, in the face of what I have referred to, we would be working to create it now or in the future. The instincts that guided Schumann, Monnet and great political figures from across the political spectrum are as true now as they were then. The themes touched on by each Deputy relate back to that level of change. Deputy Micheál Martin made an important point in stressing that between outright opponents and outright supporters of the European Union there must be a space for those who are supporters of what it has achieved in the past and is achieving but who want to be critical and offer differing views about its direction. The point is important because the absence of that space leads to the creation of political forces, as seen elsewhere, that could, if not challenged, pose great challenges to the benefits the European Union has managed to achieve. Deputy Seán Crowe referred to the need for a social Europe and for us to respond to the challenges of equality and opportunity. Where I differ is that I believe the European Union, as constituted and regardless of how it may change in the future, still provides the best platform for individual countries to respond to the challenges he correctly identified. I differ from him on the idea that the European Union imposed austerity on member states. Regardless of whether Ireland had been inside the European Union, we had reached a gap between the spending to which we had committed and the taxes we were taking in and no one was willing to fund the difference. That was one of the key reasons for the major difficulty the country has endured in recent years. The challenge was not one imposed on us by the European Union or any other body. It had to do with spending and taxation decisions made in Ireland. While saying this in reference to the point made by Deputy Micheál Martin, I acknowledge design flaws and mistakes in the mechanisms in place to create and supervise a single currency, most notably the absence of equivalence for large European banks and the absence of the measures and architecture being created in terms of how budgets are created and recognising how decisions one country makes can have a major impact on another through the shared single currency. Deputy Mick Wallace referred to Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty, a book that is getting a lot of coverage. I have read most of it and challenge his analysis about the challenges that can be posed when the rate of return on capital is substantially ahead of the rate of return delivered when national economies are growing. For me, much of the response can best be delivered through membership of something like the European Union because it offers a mechanism whereby the efforts of individual member states can be co-ordinated to deal with the difficulties of one country in taking a measure on its own and not being supported by or being challenged by decisions other countries can make. I endorse and recognise the huge work being done by Deputy Dominic Hannigan through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. I appear regularly before the committee. The point the Deputy made about the need to support the political legitimacy of the European Union is very important. If we do not keep going back to the well of popular support the peoples of Europe offer to any political project, whether national or European, we run the risk of eroding that foundation in the future. The work parliamentary committees all over Europe do, including that of the Deputy, plays an extremely important role in scrutinising the work of governments and ensuring popular support and its foundations are constantly uppermost in the minds of those of us involved in the European project.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter. This issue concerns a problem that has occurred seasonally over the past couple of years, in particular because demand has increased capacity and the system is reaching its limit. The algae involved occurs naturally in clean, fresh water and does not pose a health risk, but it seriously affects and slows down the treatment process at the production plants. As a result, over the past ten days, we have seen a significant reduction and limiting of water supplies to north-east Wicklow in particular. People in the area become annoyed when they see restrictions on water which originates in and is treated in Wicklow, albeit under Dublin City Council up to now, but from now on the responsibility of Irish Water. The water seems to be flowing unimpeded to Dublin city. I do not begrudge Dublin getting water, but many areas of north Wicklow which are much closer to the supply source are being cut off, in particular areas such as Kilpedder, Enniskerry, Kilmacanogue and higher areas where pressure has become a problem. A statement this afternoon from the head of communications at Irish Water states that it is not planned to interrupt supply tonight, 6 May, but a further assessment of shut-offs will be made tomorrow, Wednesday, 7 May. Nonetheless, properties at high elevations will suffer loss of water during daytime, but should receive enough water. I acknowledge this is an improvement on the situation. I flagged this issue at a briefing we received from Irish Water some time ago and pointed out the algae problem was a problem that was likely to occur. While, there are long-term proposals to upgrade the plant to deal with the issue, we need an interim solution. This is a predictable phenomenon. We need a rapid response plan in place. We can predict weather. Therefore, we could determine and predict this problem. We know roughly when the algae bloom is about to occur and are aware of its impact. Until we have a new plant, we know what interim, remedial work is required. Unfortunately, this involves painstakingly and laboriously scraping the algae off the filter beds to keep them in production. This may be a simple manpower issue, but it is resolvable. This interim measure should be taken until such time as the significant work to upgrade the plant is completed.  I call for the Minister, in conjunction with management and officials at Irish Water and local management, to address this issue so that we do not suffer this unnecessary and avoidable problem. As I said, the algae does not cause health problems, but indirectly, the lack of water or limited water can have a health impact on families, older people and people with special needs. Last weekend, Fáilte Ireland was part sponsor of a very successful gourmet Greystones weekend. While the gourmet weekend may not have been the reason for it, the water was turned on in Greystones for the weekend. While there was a limited supply, at least it was turned on and without it, the festival would have had to be cancelled. I call on the Minister of State to take on board the concerns I have expressed here on behalf of the citizens of north Wicklow.

However, the Department has no responsibility for, or role in, the management, maintenance or operation of water infrastructure. This is a matter for Uisce Éireann, the water services authority, which is responsible under statute for the operation, maintenance and management of water infrastructure. Local authorities, in this case Wicklow County Council, continue to provide water services on behalf of Irish Water through service level agreements that have been put in place. The Vartry water supply is a critical element of the greater Dublin area water supply system and is the sole supply to north-east Wicklow, including Bray, Greystones, Delgany and Kilmacanogue. In recent years, the plant has been badly hampered in late spring and early summer by heavy algal growth which clogs the sand filters, reducing output severely. From inquiries made to Uisce Éireann, I understand that water production at the Vartry water treatment works at Roundwood has reduced significantly due to the seasonal impact of algae in the source water. The algae occur naturally in clean, fresh water and do not pose a health risk, although it does slow the treatment process. In addition, local supply issues, which were unrelated to this reduction in production, impacted on customer supply. Irish Water has also confirmed today that supply to Enniskerry is now back to normal. However, in Greystones, there has been a continued loss of some local service. The cause of this loss is being investigated and Wicklow County Council, on behalf of Uisce Éireann, is working to ensure that all customers have a supply of water from the public mains for a period within the 24-hour day. Continued water conservation measures over the weekend were necessary to replenish the water level. Wicklow County Council is reviewing whether it will be necessary to continue with restrictions for the coming days to ensure the reservoir levels are recovered. Properties at a very high elevation have been suffering a loss of water during the day time, but should receive water at pressures sufficient to fill storage tanks during night time. The council is continuing to investigate improvements and is organising an alternative water supply via water tankers. Uisce Éireann has confirmed that water to the two main centres of population are close to normal and will further improve during this week. Customer information has been posted on the Wicklow County Council and Uisce Éireann websites and customers have been offered a range of communication channels for more information, including phone, post, web and twitter. The Irish Water customer contact centre receives regular updates on the situation so customers receive current information. This service provides details of the locations at which water is being provided from tankers. Irish Water recognises that the whole Vartry system is in need of major upgrading and has commenced a study to determine the scope, cost, timeframe and planning for the works required. Uisce Éireann is looking at options for interim plans of a temporary nature which might be put in place in the short term. Since 1 January, Irish Water has had responsibility for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure and is preparing a capital investment fund for the period 2014 to 2016. The additional funding of €200 million approved by the Cabinet this morning for the period 2015 to 2016 will assist in enabling Irish Water to accelerate additional capital projects. While I understand the distress being expressed by consumers at the lack of a continuous supply of water in their areas, Uisce Éireann and the local authorities are doing everything possible to alleviate the problems and restore an adequate and safe supply at the earliest possible opportunity.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	I thank the Minister of State for his response and acknowledge the efforts being made by Wicklow County Council to address this problem. The Minister of State has referred to local supply issues that are unrelated to the reduction in production but which have impacted negatively on the consumer. That is a contention of Irish Water and one with which the county council would likely disagree. As I understand it, the problem is to do with the pumping system which, if it is interfered with, causes more problems than it solves, including air locks. As the Minister of State noted, Irish Water is considering the provision of interim, temporary plants in the short term. That needs to happen without delay and I ask the Minister of State to communicate very strongly its urgency to the chief executive officer of Irish Water. I sent an e-mail to Irish Water more than one week ago using the Oireachtas Members' e-mail facility and have yet to receive a response. I wrote to the CEO on Thursday expressing my disappointment at the lack of a response against a background where we had received strong reassurance there would be no such issue. I do not like having to raise the matter here, but I am obliged to do so. It is not acceptable that a query submitted on behalf of a considerable number of people, all of whom will be expected to pay their water charges, should be ignored in this way. I have no problem with the introduction of water charges, but people cannot be expected to pay for water when there is no supply. We need to address this issue now; it is not something that can be left on the long finger. While significant funds will be coming on stream for capital development, an interim measure is necessary to ensure the problem does not recur. As I said, it is a predictable and foreseeable issue and a plan of action must be in place to address it.

Everybody is entitled to a response to his or her queries, whether he or she is a Member of the Oireachtas through the 1890 278278 telephone number or the e-mail facility or an ordinary member of the public. One of the key objectives is that Irish Water should be able to respond to issues as they arise and ensure communications are properly and effectively managed. The Deputy's experience is not acceptable and I will ask Uisce Éireann to get back to him immediately on the matter.

What is happening in the provision of discretionary medical cards is simply deplorable and something must be done to alleviate the burden being imposed on families. Those affected include individuals who are very ill, some of whom are terminally ill, and many facing huge challenges and difficulties in their everyday lives. The Government, however, continues to insist there has been no change in policy. If there has been no change in policy, there certainly has been a change in practice. The numbers speak for themselves when it comes to the culling of discretionary medical cards, with a reduction of more than 30,000 since 2009. To any fair-minded person, the idea that the probity exercise of €113 million announced in the budget would not in some way impact on people is beyond belief. At this stage, if we could get the Government to accept that the policy or practice it is pursuing is having a detrimental impact, we would at least have achieved something. The issues that arise day in and day out in constituency clinics throughout the country and which have been repeatedly raised in the House in the past two years by Members of all parties and none must surely resonate with the Minister. There has to be a reversal of policy in this regard. The Government has chosen to prioritise the provision of free GP care for all children aged five years and under. I have said time and again in the House that the easy, populist choice for me would be to endorse that proposal without criticism. The difficultly, however, is that the resources which will be applied to fund free GP care for the under sixes are being taken from children and older people facing the gravest challenges on a daily basis. For many of them, it is a challenge just to get through one day. Universal provision of free GP care is a noble idea; the problem arises when there are scarce resources. By my analysis and that of many commentators, this proposal is being funded by depriving those who need a medical card simply to get by on a daily basis. We on this side of the House have consistently maintained that there must be a prioritisation of need in this matter. The Minister has spoken about being a proud citizen of this republic. Any genuine republic should be judged on how it treats those in most need of the state's support. It is not in the vein of true republicanism to ask a very sick seven year old, a very frail 90 year old, a person with motor neuron disease or a child with Down's syndrome to fund general practice cards for healthy children of five years and under, some of whom are from affluent backgrounds. That is simply wrong. I urge the Minister to reverse the cull of discretionary medical cards which is in nobody's interests, least of all those who need them most.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. To clarify, an additional €37 million in funding was made available in the budget for the specific purpose of providing free GP care for children aged six years and under. We are not taking money from anybody else to fund the initiative. Under the Health Act 1970, persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their families can qualify for a medical card, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure. The Health Service Executive can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, must assess the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its medical card national assessment guidelines. "Undue hardship" is ascertained through an assessment of financial means. It is not legally possible to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a disease. However, where an applicant or a member of his or her family has an illness or disease, medical costs and necessary expenses arising from that condition are taken into account in the assessment process for a medical card. Thus, people whose means are above the income limits but who face genuine hardship in providing GP care for themselves and their dependants may qualify for a medical card. Recent media reports have referred to the reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards. I reiterate that there is no policy to abolish the awarding of medical cards on discretionary grounds or target any patient group.The medical card scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer undue financial hardship as a result of a disease or an illness are awarded medical cards. Last year I insisted on a medical team being put in place to review the position on discretionary medical cards in order that people's medical conditions would be taken into account in the context of the financial hardship to which they gave rise. While the number who hold medical cards on discretionary grounds has fallen in recent years, many individuals who previously were marginally over the normal qualifying guidelines have been granted medical cards. Only a small proportion of people with discretionary medical cards have been found to be ineligible for medical cards. While the number in this regard may be small, I in no way underestimate the difficulties caused for those who are considered ineligible. We know that even where medical expenses have been taken into account, there will be some who are not eligible because their net income remains in excess of the guidelines, sometimes by as much as €1,000 a week. Some of the households in question include people with ongoing medical conditions and, in that context, I have asked the HSE to consider how best we can ensure such households receive all the supports available to them from the health system, within the relevant legislative parameters. The clear intention is to ensure people's entitlements to health services will be maximised to the fullest extent possible, especially where individuals may be facing significant medical expenses. This process is ongoing and I hope it will come to a conclusion in the near future.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	My difficulty is that we have been raising this issue for over two years. In that time we have drawn a complete blank in obtaining an admission that there is a difficulty in respect of those with discretionary medical cards. Last week, however, there was some semblance of a response from the Minister when some 20 of his colleagues in Fine Gael raised this issue at a parliamentary party meeting and he acknowledged that we at least had to consider it. We must do more than this. In good times and bad, the process of governing involves establishing priorities and making choices. In that context, the Minister has, unfortunately, got caught in a bind between the commitments made in respect of free GP care and trying to fund a health service which, for many reasons, is inadequately resourced. I accept all of the responsibility my party bears in that regard and which the Minister outlines on a continual basis. In this instance, however, the difficulty has arisen on foot of a choice made by him initially. It is echoed in similar choices being made on a daily basis by the Department of Health and the HSE and under his watch. As a result of the choices to which I refer, resources are being transferred from those who need them most to persons who may not need them at all. That is clearly wrong. As a result of a television interview on Saturday night last, people have been made aware of the case of Alex Coyle. There are hundreds of similar cases. Organisations which represent and advocate on behalf of people with profound intellectual and physical disabilities and life-limiting illnesses have stated it is inherently more difficult for people to retain discretionary medical cards or access full medical cards than it was some years ago. Regardless of whether the Minister likes it, there has been a change in practice. I urge him to amend this by introducing a policy initiative in order to ensure vulnerable people will be protected.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	During 2013 the HSE issued 644,858 review notices. As of 27 February 2014, assessments of eligibility had been concluded of 482,000 medical card holders and continuing eligibility was confirmed in respect of 465,000, or 96.4%, of these individuals. Some 17,258 medical cards, or 3.6%, were not renewed because the eligibility criteria, that is, the income thresholds, were not met. In a further 52,000 cases medical cards were not renewed because the card holders did not respond in the review process. On the date in question, assessments of eligibility were ongoing in respect of 102,000 medical cards and in 6,736 cases the card holders were deceased. I could supply the Deputy with much more information, but I will not do so at this time. There must be probity within the system as a result of the continually changing dynamic. From discussing the matter with the primary care reimbursement office, PCRS, I am aware that the vast majority are not written to at all, except to be informed that they will be keeping their medical cards. This is because we know, on foot of the information in our possession, that they are entitled to them. Another large group are only required to tick a box to indicate that their circumstances have not changed. We are required to examine a small percentage of cases in order to ensure those involved are still entitled to medical cards. As Minister for Health, my role is to ensure the system retains the compassion it is supposed to possess in the first instance. I am also obliged to ensure there is more focus on ensuring people have access to the support and care they require as opposed to medical cards. The HSE is seeking to find the best way to achieve that to which I refer in order to ensure families will receive the support they need.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I was prompted to raise this matter once more by reports in the Sunday newspapers which indicated that the Coombe hospital did not have full insurance prior to 1961 and which highlighted the prospect that it would be obliged to bear the cost of claims related to the 14 symphysiotomies carried out in it between 1950 and 1967. Frenzied calls were then made in respect of bankruptcy by some of the patient associations. These calls were not repeated by the Minister or the survivors of symphysiotomy. The claims of bankruptcy have clearly been exaggerated, but the real issue relates to how we might obtain justice for those women who were so cruelly butchered in their prime. I am somewhat concerned about both the origin and timing of the story. It emerged against the background that, relatively soon, the Minister who is examining the Murphy report would be making an announcement on how he proposed to deal with this issue. I again record the determination of the survivors that they will not be corralled into any sort of redress scheme. I do not know whether the story relating to the Coombe - one of the hospitals in which only a small number of symphysiotomies were carried out - has been put out in order to create a climate against the women taking the type of legal action I believe they are entitled to pursue. It is clear that the damage visited on the women to whom I refer cannot be undone. Some were obliged to undergo 25 operations following the initial procedure and left immobilised while in the prime of their lives. In many instances, children were robbed of their mothers, while husbands were robbed of their wives. The women in question were obliged to suffer incontinence and chronic pain for decades. In some ways, this is not a health issue at all; it should be treated as one of justice. One of the important points to make is that the survivors have made it clear time and again that they view it as one of personal injury caused by gross medical negligence. They need this to be acknowledged before there can be any closure in this matter. The judgment handed down in January by the European Court of Human Rights in the O'Keeffe case vindicated the position of the survivors of symphysiotomy, namely, that redress schemes are not adequate in addressing the needs of the victims of human rights abuses. It is clear that the women to whom I refer are the victims of such abuses. The women in question have stated any scheme based on the Magdalen laundry model would be unacceptable because wrongdoing would not be admitted and due to the fact the levels of restitution would fail to reflect the damage done to them. References to payments in excess of €50,000 being made on a phased basis appear to be a cynical ploy aimed at ensuring the women who are elderly will die before they receive full compensation. If a Magdalen laundry model were adopted, there would also be no right of appeal and the right of the women concerned to independent legal representation would be denied. Some members of the Survivors of Symphysiotomy group have indicated that such a scheme would be one of the worst imaginable and that they are not interested in pursuing it. The group offered to meet the Minister over one year ago in order to discuss their proposals with regard to what they believed would constitute an adequate and acceptable settlement. Such a settlement could facilitate the provision of more appropriate restitution along the lines of what the courts were offering but with a haircut to reflect both the austere economic times in which we are living and the fact that legal actions would not be taken.However, they also require an individualised assessment and independent medical and legal supports such that the compensation paid would reflect the range of injuries inflicted on them. I call on the Minister to reconsider that position and to agree to meet the survivors of symphysiotomy to negotiate a settlement. If the Minister imposes a settlement it will only result in their going to the Irish and European courts to seek justice.

Second, no one is coercing anyone into anything. To effectively and comprehensively provide indemnity to hospitals and their patients in the event of a medical mishap, the State introduced the clinical indemnity scheme in 2002. The scheme is managed by the State Claims Agency and provides a robust system for managing eligible claims that arise nationally from that date. Indemnity in respect of claims made relating to incidents occurring prior to the introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme in 2002 is a matter for the individual hospitals concerned and their insurers. The Government at the time decided that the clinical indemnity scheme should not apply retrospectively given that individual hospitals and doctors would have purchased indemnity from insurers on a commercial basis and insurers have an obligation to fully provide the cover which had been purchased. It is important to remind ourselves of that fact. Insurers have an obligation in this regard. The master of the Coombe Women & Infants University Hospital informed the Secretary General of my Department in April last year that the hospital had issues relating to insurance cover prior to 1961. Since this matter has arisen in the context of legal proceedings the Department cannot comment on indemnity obtained by either the hospital or the medical practitioners involved in respect of any individual claims. Indemnity is a complex technical issue and a range of indemnity and insurance arrangements are in place for hospitals from before the establishment of the State's clinical indemnity scheme. My Department together with the State Claims Agency will continue to monitor the position in respect of historical claims against the Coombe hospital. Since coming into office I have endeavoured to satisfactorily facilitate closure for approximately 250 women affected by symphysiotomy. On 26 November 2013 the Government approved the appointment of the retired Circuit Court judge, Yvonne Murphy, to assist in setting out a possible course of action in respect of women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomies. Judge Murphy commenced a review of the issues relating to symphysiotomy in December and submitted a report to me in mid-March. I am examining the report and its recommendations and I intend to bring a memorandum to Government in the coming weeks in order that a decision can be taken as early as possible with regard to the next steps. Any proposals brought to Government will take into account the findings of the independent research report, Symphysiotomy in Ireland, 1944 – 1984, commissioned by the Department, otherwise known the Walsh report, along with any other relevant information. It is also intended that the Walsh report would be published once the Government has decided on its response to this complex and sensitive issue.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	I hope I can take the Minister's extra minute. The Survivors of Symphysiotomy group specifically requested that the Minister meet them to discuss their proposals for a settlement of survivors' actions. This is the meeting to which I am referring. Their needs include that the wrong be acknowledged and that restitution be in line with what has been awarded by the courts. In the Kearney v. McQuillan case Mrs. Kearney was awarded over €300,000. That was probably a mid-range case rather than one of the more severe cases. In other cases, figures of approximately €600,000 have been mentioned. The group are prepared to negotiate a haircut on those amounts but the key stumbling block is that there is no acknowledgement of wrongdoing. The Minister referred to the Walsh report, but that report was much criticised for the very reason that basically it stated that the practice of symphysiotomy was medically acceptable at that time, although it actually was not, and because there was no admission of wrongdoing. There is a belief that much of this is framed to protect the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the interests of certain members of that organisation. Furthermore, if hospitals are insured then individual medical practitioners are also so insured, and presumably their personal insurance could be called to account to pay for some of these debts and for the horrendous cruelty and damage inflicted on these women. A repeat of the arguments that have been rejected by the overwhelming bulk of the survivors simply means we are going around in circles on this issue, and as a result I do not believe we will have a solution. Since he has said that he has met the group several times - I know he has - I call on the Minister to take up their invitation from one year ago to sit down and discuss precisely what they are seeking in respect of the legal actions. I fear that if this does not happen we will be dealing with European court cases, going to the United Nations committees and so on. Meanwhile, the women concerned are getting older and some of them have tragically died in the intervening years.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	I accept that the Deputy has the interests of the women at heart, as do I. The reality is that many of the women in these cases do not know the doctor concerned, cannot remember the name of the doctor or cannot find notes. The possibility of their succeeding in court is next to nil. Deputy Daly referred to a court case involving a lady who has been very public about her experiences, but it took her 11 years to get a settlement. How many more women will pass away in that period? I am trying to bring closure to this in the quickest way possible for all the women concerned. I realise that for many of them what is suggested, regardless of what it is, will not be a suitable substitute for going to the courts. The case Deputy Daly highlighted was a clear wrong. It was symphysiotomy on the way out, as it is alluded to - in other words, symphysiotomy after the baby had been born - which is utterly inexplicable. I know the suffering that these women have had and I have heard their harrowing stories. I want to address their suffering by achieving closure of this as quickly as possible. I know I cannot undo the pain they have endured. That pain is physical, psychological and societal in many respects because it limited their ability to socialise. Having said that, I have no wish to pre-empt what the Government might say. We have a report. I wish to take advice from the Government. A memorandum is going to Government shortly. I believe this is the quickest way to expedite the matter for all the ladies concerned. No one is suggesting for one moment that people who wish to go to court would be prevented from so doing.

I apologise on behalf of my colleague Deputy Barry Cowen, who has a family commitment this evening. He assures me, and he is keen to assure the Minister, that he will be here in fine fettle tomorrow night. Despite the big announcement and the drama and spin today, there are still serious questions this evening over the Government's water charges regime as well as the long-term implications for users, families, taxpayers and those on low and fixed incomes. We welcome the fact that this motion finally forced the Government, particularly the Labour Party, to come clean on their charges. I know it was the ambition of the Government, and the Labour Party in particular, to avoid having to do that ahead of the local and European elections. Anyway, substantial questions remain and this evening's announcement is not the end of the matter. We still do not know the precise charges that will apply to hard-pressed families and water users throughout the country. The €240 is an estimate and gives no certainty to anyone. I gather we will have to wait until August.Despite all of the political pirouetting of recent weeks, this is the figure that Labour promised Fine Gael would deliver in 2011. At least it is an election promise that Labour has kept. There is no guarantee of service and there is a vague commitment on capital investment. Despite Government assertions of underinvestment, during our time in government €2 billion was invested in water services. That investment was made through local authorities around the country, many of which were controlled by the Minister's party and Labour. The criticisms by Fine Gael backbenchers of the inefficiencies of that investment can be left at their door.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	Despite €180 million of local property tax being invested in Irish Water, not a single cent of this was spent on fixing leaking pipes or addressing problems with quality in many parts of the country. In the Minister's remarks, he might address the issue of water charges for the 1 million households that will still be without meters when charges kick in next October. Despite an accelerated metering programme, more than half of the country's houses will be without meters at the end of this year, which is the end of the first quarter of charging. As such, there will be a flat charge for hundreds of thousands of households at least until they get meters, which will possibly be as late as 2016. They have no certainty about this flat charge. The commitments in respect of water allowances for children and a cap on charges for people with special needs are vague and have definitely been determined in a pre-election period. No detail of the medical conditions that will qualify people to receive discounts has been provided. This will require consultation between the Ministers, Deputies Hogan and Reilly, and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. We have seen the hames being made of discretionary medical cards by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly. Will this be a repeat of that fiasco? The Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated that €40 million would come from the Department of Social Protection. Will it be from existing budgets or must there be a Supplementary Estimate for that Department? Many of the measures to be undertaken by the Department will be tagged onto the household benefits package, which the Government has driven a coach and four through in every budget since entering office in 2011. There used to be a telephone allowance; there is none now. There used to be an electricity allowance; it is much reduced. I predict that the €100 water allowance will go the same way as the telephone allowance as long as the Government is in power. The debacle of Irish Water's establishment and the manner in which the regime, limited as it is, had to be dragged out has undermined public confidence in that utility company. Water is essential and there is much to be done in terms of conservation and investment, but forcing a model on people that is completely based on charges instead of investing in the service or encouraging people to conserve is not the way to go. However, it is the way the Minister has outlined. Those houses that will not be metered face serious questions. Apparently, they will be assessed based on the number of adults and children in each house. Had the Minister listened to the public debate at any stage, he would have heard that adults differ, children differ and, depending on age, people have different usages. He would also have heard medical experts this evening discussing various needs arising from medical conditions. For an unmetered house where there is no ability to measure or to see the impact of conservation, it is all pi in the sky. These houses need some certainty. Will they be the ones that pay for the Minister's deal with the Labour Party? Will the fact that they do not have meters mean they can be played around with until such time as their meters are installed, making them the profit centre for Irish Water in an attempt to alleviate the political pressure on the Labour Party? The Minister has yet to provide the CER with the policy framework it needs to proceed with the exact pricing structure. He is delaying four key items on which it is waiting, including the level of the free allowance, which he has decided will be 30,000 litres. Given that the average usage in a house is 140,000 litres, this allowance is a far way off. Even when the 38,000 litre allowance for under 18 year olds is added, the overall allowance is still far short of what many families will use, not in a wasteful way or one that requires conservation, but in the normal day-to-day family home scenario. There is a vagueness about the level of public subvention. Irish Water's questions and answers document, which was released this evening, highlights this vagueness as well as the difficulties it presents to Irish Water in calculating a pricing structure. The Minister has announced a first fix policy, which is interesting and welcome, but this will use some €50 million of the extra €200 million investment under the capital programme. There will be a no fix policy for other repairs and people will need to pay for them to be done. Given the state of much of the infrastructure, will they still be required to pay if the faults are not theirs? The linkage between low-income household supports and the household package and the vagueness around the funding of low-income household supports raise questions and doubts. The estimated bills, as outlined by the Minister today, will be approximately €240 per household. This figure could increase under various economic models to €580, depending on public subvention levels. This is similar to the property tax. The Government introduced it, then doubled it. It will be subject to further increases in the coming years. For many householders, the difficulty lies in the fact that they are paying local service charges and will soon pay water charges. The combined amounts will hammer households, making them fear for their ability to pay this charge. They must know what they will get in return. If people are in metered houses, they need to know that they will no longer have access to the information contained in the meters after next August because it will be the property of Irish Water. This is unlike the case of electricity meters, where people can see the information. What kind of information will bills give them on their usage? What certainty will there be for people who engage in conservation and follow the advice that sages in the Minister's party have been giving in various media outlets this evening? Some of the most unlikely Fine Gael Deputies have the zeal of the Green Party as regards water conservation. If people follow that advice, will they be able to see it working? Will they have access to Irish Water's information? Given how quickly the metering programme has proceeded to date, is there not a case to be made for extra investment to ensure we reduce the number of unmetered households to below the expected mark before billing begins? Can Irish Water not use some of its money wisely for a change? The water charging system must be efficient and coherent. It must encourage water preservation while creating a sustainable funding base so as to secure the supply of water for business and domestic users. However, households cannot be expected to pay for a service that does not deliver or give them information or clarity on the costs. Consider the different water leakage rates around the country - 16% in south Dublin and, I gather, 60% in Kerry. The national leakage rate is 40%. This shows why there must be a coherent, sustained and ambitious roll-out of mains renewal and serious investment. A case must be made for the Minister to invest further in the network and to consider various funding options, for example, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other available schemes. Focusing investment would create employment. Then the Minister could tell people that the money being spent on Irish Water was being spent in the right way. The Minister has not given the precise details on the formation of Irish Water or its expenditure on consultancies. Its set-up costs have been incredibly high, yet not a single cent has yet been spent on the network. The lack of information and wastage of resources have left public confidence in Irish Water low even before it begins in its role. There is significant public confidence in many of our utilities, for example, ESB. In order for people to have such confidence in Irish Water, we need clarity as well as scrutiny of its expenditure, employment practices and plans on rolling out this project. The way in which Irish Water was established is coming back to haunt the Minister. The debate was rammed through the Dáil on its last sitting day in 2013. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, promised to amend the Bill, as Irish Water was initially not subject to freedom of information requests. This situation needs to be clarified so as to build confidence among the public that their money is being spent properly. Will the Minister clarify a couple of issues? What are the prospects for unmetered houses?What is the highest amount they will pay, or is it in the Minister's gift to establish a maximum amount they will have to pay? Second, where will the €40 million come from within the Department of Social Protection budget? The Minister, Deputy Burton, in her parish newsletter in the Sunday Independent last weekend, promised that there will not be any cuts in the Department of Social Protection budget but less than 48 hours after it was published, we have a €40 million-----

If it does, that promise given today will be as good as that given by the Minister, Deputy Burton, last Sunday. Many issues remain regarding Irish Water. There is still zero public confidence in Irish Water. There is still zero political confidence, even on the benches behind the Minister, in Irish Water. The charade of recent weeks is all about the elections on 23 May, and nothing else. The so-called fight within Government over the level of charges to households has ended up bringing us back to exactly where we were in February 2011, when Labour predicted that Fine Gael would introduce a fee of €238; the fee has increased. It predicted that in 2011 and promised it would stop it, but here we are tonight facing a minimum charge of €238 for those fortunate enough to be metered. For those unmetered that could increase to God knows what amount. That is a great result for the so-called party of the lower classes. I look forward to the Minister using this debate to bring clarity to the various issues. I look forward also to my colleague concluding the debate.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	At the outset I compliment Deputy Barry Cowen for drafting the motion and my colleague, Deputy Calleary, for moving the motion. As the Minister is well aware, many people are already to the pin of their collar to get by financially on a week to week basis. Putting aside the jockeying and the politics of Fine Gael and Labour on this issue over the past three weeks, the bottom line is that the introduction of water meters here will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many families.  I have learned from examining statistics down the years that averages can be very misleading, and it is worth teasing out in more detail some of the facts the Minister put on the record today by way of the Government decision. The average charge of €240 per household includes households where there is only one occupant, therefore, the average is immediately dragged down by that fact because it includes all those people. On the "Six One News" a couple of hours ago the Minister made the point that the average gross charge per adult is €138; therefore, for two adults in a house the average charge is almost €280, not €240 because the €240 includes properties occupied by only one adult.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	If we examine the figures we will see that the people who will be crucified by what the Minister is introducing will be families with grown up children still living with them. He is providing a free allowance of 38,000 litres for a child under the age of 18 but many people in leaving certificate year are 18 or even 19 years of age or they are attending college for a number of years. The reality is that a household with two parents and two or three grown up children over the age of 18 could be facing a water charges bill of €600 or €700 per annum, even based on the Minister's own figures. We know that young adults will use a great deal of water because they are involved in sport, and they socialise. Their use of water will be far greater than that of the children for whom the Minister has provided a free allowance of 38,000 litres. The reality is that where there are more than two adults in the house, families with grown up children still in school or starting off in the workforce, they will be facing savage water bills in the years ahead. In many cases the bills for those people will be €600 and €700. The obvious place to start in all of this is to fix the system. It is daft to have contractors installing water meters around the country when the Minister confessed that approximately 40% of the water generated is leaking from the pipes and going into the ground. That does not make any sense. The Government has access to a National Pensions Reserve Fund of over €6 billion. That could be leveraged for a commercial project such as this one, which has the potential to deliver a return in the long term by initially fixing the water system so we can eliminate the leaks. Most Irish people are fair-minded. If they have a proper quality water supply where the issue of outages is kept to an absolute minimum, they are open to paying for good quality water, but that is not the situation now facing them. The Minister made great play about the fact that the standing charge has disappeared but the spokesperson for Irish Water made it very clear on "Drivetime" a few hours ago that, in effect, the standing charge is now being incorporated into the per litre charge that will be charged on households. How else can a situation be arrived at where the average figure is remaining the same? The average figure before the standing charge was removed was €240. The average figure now with the standing charge gone is still €240. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister have been going around saying that people will get a very generous free allowance. The impression was given that if people are prudent and sensible with their use of water they will not have much of a water charge. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Minister said the average use of water for an adult is approximately 78,000 litres, therefore, for two people it will be in the region of 150,000 litres. The allowance being given to that household is 20% of that, namely, 30,000 litres. The notion, therefore, that people are being given a generous free allowance does not stand up to scrutiny. People will be charged, and the standing charge is being built into the per litre charge for the water being charged on people. A fundamental issue relates to quality. The Minister said in his statement today that Irish Water will have to take account of the quality of services provided to customers, including circumstances where services are reduced or restricted due to boil water notices etc. As the Minister is well aware, there are very localised problems in many cases. I received an e-mail the other day from a constituent who told me her tale about the quality of the water supply. There was no boil water notice issued in her area but her experience was one of broken pipes as the system is so old. She stated:Normally, when we finally do get connected we have to run off gallons of thick, brown water and this can take as long as an hour or more. However, who is going to pay for all the water run off in the kitchen, the bathroom, the toilet etc.? Who will clean out the sludge from the cold water tank and the toilet cisterns? On occasions, even after over an hour, we still have to boil the water so that it is usable. If I am in the middle of a clothes wash, the washing has to be rewashed as clothes are dirty brown.That is the reality for many people in terms of their experience of water quality. In many cases the quality is very poor, and we have not had a satisfactory explanation as to how Irish Water will take account of that quality issue, which is a real problem for many families. I do not understand the reason bonuses are being built into the Irish Water structure before a single pipe in the country has been fixed. There should be no suggestion of that.The Minister said approximately 1 million meters will be installed. As I understand it, based on the local property tax system, there are approximately 2 million properties in the country. Leaving aside group water schemes and so on the Minister should be able to provide a breakdown of how these 2 million properties are to be treated for water charges into the future.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	There is no doubt but that the public takes a cynical view of politics in general in this country. This is evident from the opinion polls and the dissatisfaction ratings of the Government and all political parties. It is worrying and disturbing that a large section of our society is cynical about the way in which politics in this country is being conducted. The evolution of Irish Water and the progression to charging for the supply of water in this country, broken promises, spin, vagueness, couching of language and general attempts by Government to avoid telling the public what they want to know are among the reasons for this cynicism. To use the Taoiseach's words, "Paddy likes to know". Unfortunately, Paddy is not being told the truth or, at least, the whole truth in relation to the charging structure coming down the tracks from Government and Irish Water. That is regrettable. I believe this motion forced the Government's hand. The statement made today by the Government is shrouded in vagueness. During the recent progression of the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 through the House many Government Deputies who seek to be champions of freedom of information happily voted to exempt Irish Water from that legislation. Another issue of concern is that of bonuses within the new entity of Irish Water. Irish Water has rightly been described as a bonus-driven, out-of-control super quango. It is worrying that this recently established semi-State company, in advance of offering the public its services and a transparent water charging regime, is paying vast bonuses. I do not believe this should be permitted. The Government should have taken steps to address that. Following on from this is the issue of millions of euro expended by Irish Water on consultancy fees. The question that must be asked, in the context of the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards and queues at accident and emergency departments is whether this expenditure by a new entity was necessary. The public is very concerned and cynical. Today we had various people, including members of the Labour Party, absent as usual from debates on Private Members' motions, trying to claim credit for what was announced, as if it was a type of political win. The Government needs to stop treating the public as fools and using people as a pawn in the middle of an election campaign. The public want to know where they stand. As outlined by the two previous speakers from this side, the €240 mentioned is, unfortunately, an average of what consumers will pay. We do not know the maximum or minimum payment or the amount of water to be provided free of charge. Can the Minister tell us how long 30,000 free litres will last on average? Also, as mentioned by Deputy Michael McGrath, what will be the free entitlement of a household in which there are a number of children over 18 years of age? How are people to afford this charge? This is the question foremost on people's minds. The Minister has stated that equity and fairness will be ensured. As rightly stated earlier, no real element of equity or fairness was built into the household charge or local property tax. The property tax was subsequently doubled. People are focused on and concerned about this issue because they cannot afford a bill which could be anywhere north of €500. It would be great if every bill was €240 but that will not be the case. The Minister needs to tell us the maximum and minimum payments. We also need clarity in relation to the service level agreements. These 12 year agreements entered into by the local authorities with Irish Water were also shrouded in secrecy. I know that a number of local authorities produced their estimates without having had sight of the service level agreements, many of which arrived in the local authorities over the Christmas period. That is no way to reform local government or present Estimates. Despite the transfer of billions of euro of assets to Irish Water the pension liabilities remain with local authorities. This leads to the conclusion that Irish Water may in future be privatised, which is also of concern. I would be obliged if the Minister when responding later would address those issues. Unfortunately, despite the announcement by Government today there is not clarity around this issue. The public is entitled to clarity. The Government can dress this up in PR speak all it wants but the public needs clarity. I do not believe the public got that today.

Given the Labour Party's position prior to the last general election was to oppose the introduction of water charges, I never expected to be debating the introduction of water charges in this House during the lifetime of this Government. The 2011 Labour Party manifesto states: "Labour does not favour water charges". On 18 February 2011, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, stated: "We are not in favour of water charges". On 28 June 2010, the Tánaiste in an article in The Irish Examiner states: "I am against water charges. Water is a necessity. I will always believe that essential services like water should be delivered as a public service." Obviously, somewhere along the way the Labour Party abandoned its ideals and the commitments it gave to the Irish people prior to the last general election. What we are now faced with is the introduction of make-shift water charges. Serious questions arise in relation to the Government's proposed water charges regime and the long-term implications of this for taxpayers and social welfare recipients. We welcome that Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been forced to come clean on aspects of the water charges plan. Fine Gael in particular has been doing its utmost to avoid having to tell households ahead of the local and European elections how much they will have to pay for their water. The Government's hand was forced by the tabling of this motion which demands an end to the secrecy surrounding the water charges regime. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, focused in today's announcement on charges rather than water quality.He did not outline any major investment in water networks. He gave no guarantee that families who fork out hundreds of euro per year for their water-----

It is still the case that despite the tens of millions of euro in taxpayers' money pumped into the setting up of Irish Water, not a cent has gone towards fixing a leaky pipe or addressing serious problems with water quality in certain areas. I am told by members of the local authority that if a constituent makes a complaint about a leak, he must contact Irish Water, which in turn contacts the local authority. The local water service man must then assess the leak, obtain three quotations for fixing it and send the details back to Irish Water before a decision is made on repairing it. Obviously, it is bureaucracy gone mad. There is confusion surrounding the water charges for the 1 million households that will be still without meters when charges commence in October. We have heard all about the accelerated metering programme. The fact is that more than half of the houses in the country will still be without a meter at the end of the year. Irrespective of how the Government spins the matter, there will be flat-rate charges for hundreds of thousands of households for at least the first year. The Minister did not state today, but will perhaps clarify tonight, what he means by "flat rate charge". How much will a person have to pay if his house has no meter? It is important that the Minister be up-front and spell out what people will have to pay. We are concerned that the commitment to a water allowance for children and the cap on charges for people with special needs is a very short-term commitment to salvage votes for Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the upcoming local and European elections. The Minister refers to special concessions but he did not state whether they will extend beyond 2016. Are they just short-term concessions? We all know of the series of reductions brought about by the Government affecting concessions for old age pensioners. I refer to the telephone and electricity allowances, the withdrawal of medical cards and all the areas that have been seriously hit. We would like the Minister to spell out clearly whether the special allowances will be short-term or long-term. We have consistently opposed the Government's Irish Water charges model, which was rammed through the Dáil in order to avoid real scrutiny. This entirely new layer of bureaucracy, populated by highly paid consultants and which will involve unwarranted bonus payments, will be funded directly by water charges on ordinary homeowners and businesses across the country. When the Minister established Irish Water, he ignored all the advice available to him. This was the case when he awarded the contract to Bord Gáis. The PwC report that was commissioned by the Government itself advised against using an existing State agency such as Bord Gáis as it would incur costs due to the level of external support required to plan, manage and execute the integration of Irish Water into an existing utility. The Government went against this advice and set up Uisce Éireann. As Deputy Collins stated, the public is very concerned and annoyed about the significant payments to the employees of Irish Water. They are very concerned about the bonuses being paid to the senior staff in the organisation and they perceive a lack of transparency and accountability. Despite the efforts of every Deputy in this House to obtain some information on the costs involved in setting up Irish Water and those associated with consultants and advisers, no one seems to be able to get the exact figure from the Minister. I, along with the public, believe there will be an enormous cost. Some of the figures being bandied about indicate costs of well over €100,000 and €150,000, so the Minister needs to clarify the period for which costs will continue to arise. The Minister, whom I saw on television today, made very clear that the regulator will have the final say. I have always had serious concerns about regulators having the final say-----

From having listened to the Minister this evening, I believe he seems to be saying again that the final decision will rest with the regulator. With regard to the social protection budget, the Minister made great play about the concessions he will give to less well-off people in society. The concessions will amount to approximately €40 million in total and will come from the social protection budget. This raises alarm bells in respect of the impact on key social welfare supports. The Government has already slashed child benefit and cut a range of supports for people with disabilities and their carers. It has targeted young jobseekers. The Government needs to spell out exactly where the €40 million is to come from. Will it be taken from next year's budget or this year's? Will it require cuts to social welfare payments in the future? Currently, responsibility for the supervision and licensing of group water schemes rests with local authorities. Will this continue to be the case? What is the position on the schemes? There are many such schemes in County Wexford. I am sure the Minister appreciates the great work being done voluntarily by those organising group water schemes throughout the country. I am sure he will clear up the matter tonight. Some groups feel under threat and that they will be forced to hand over their schemes to Irish Water eventually, although perhaps not this year or the next. Tremendous partnerships have existed between local authorities and group water schemes down through the years. This is the way to continue. Will future financing of group water schemes be carried out directly by the Government or Department, or will the funding have to come from Uisce Éireann? The Minister needs to clarify this. I hope that tonight, when he is responding, he will outline very clearly where he sees group water schemes fitting into the modern water scheme for the future. Will the group schemes continue to be under the control of local authorities or will they eventually be taken over by Uisce Éireann? Despite the Minister’s announcement today, we have not got the full picture. It is a case of fobbing us off to get his party and the Labour Party over the local elections on 23 May. There is a lot of small print still to be issued and it will seriously affect people, who will have to pay more than €238 per annum. As some Deputies have pointed out tonight, they could be paying twice that by the time the full facts emerge on foot of the Minister's announcement today.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	The programme for Government contained commitments in respect of a comprehensive programme of reform of the structures for delivering State services which included plans for the overhaul of the delivery of water services. The Government's programme of reform of water services is a vital step towards ensuring the sustainability of Ireland's water resources. The people of Ireland deserve first class water services and a system in which the drinking water they are supplied with is safe and wholesome. It is also critical that wastewater be treated effectively to avoid causing pollution to watercourses and beaches. We also need to ensure there is security of supply in order to attract investment in towns and cities throughout the country. This is also critical to economic growth as a reliable water supply will promote economic competitiveness and, in particular, can assist in promoting and attracting water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agrifood companies. The programme for Government recognised the need for modernisation and committed to the introduction of a fair funding model, the establishment of a new water utility, Irish Water, and the implementation of a fair charging system based on usage above a free allowance. It is clear that the Government is delivering on these commitments. In July 2013 Irish Water was established as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Energy which has saved €80 million to date. Moving from the previous fragmented approach, where water services were provided by 34 separate local authorities, is an important milestone in the reform programme. We cannot continue with a situation where €1.2 billion of taxpayers' money is being spent each year, with 40% of the water leaking away into the ground. Irish Water will provide a co-ordinated national approach, with a focus on reducing operational costs and achieving economies of scale in service delivery. A co-ordinated national approach will allow major cost savings through achieving economies of scale in service delivery and for targeted reduction of the unacceptable levels of treated drinking water being lost through the water mains. The integrated utility model being put in place by Irish Water will provide the basis for the new utility to borrow from the capital markets, in the same way as other utilities, fund an accelerated capital programme and address infrastructural deficits. Fianna Fáil's solution, of course, is to continue as we are and ignore the need for greater expenditure. It fails to point to where it will get the money to provide for a more ambitious capital programme. Would it be through higher taxes on income or through cuts in expenditure in the areas of health, education or social protection? It cannot have it every way. This is the model we have taken in order to borrow money so as to ensure we can continue to invest to ensure job creation, stability and growth on the basis that we will not increase taxes on work or incur additional cuts in expenditure over and above what is included in the troika agreement. In July 2013 Irish Water commenced work on the domestic water metering programme. The installation of meters provides for a fair way of charging households for water services. People will be charged based on what they use and provided with an incentive to use water efficiently. The international evidence shows that where meters are introduced, savings in excess of 10% can be expected. This is a major capital project which will see water meters installed in over 1 million homes by 2016. It is also an incredibly ambitious programme, with the level of meter installation far in excess of that for similar programmes being undertaken by water companies in other parts of the European Union. For example, Southern Water in the United Kingdom is implementing a 500,000 meter installation programme over five years, while up to 450,000 meters will have been installed by Irish Water in the first 17 months of its programme. Notwithstanding this, the roll-out of the metering programme has taken account of supply chain availability, quality control, health and safety issues and the practical need to minimise disruption to pedestrians and motorists. Already, over 200,000 meters have been installed by Irish Water since the commencement of the metering programme. The programme has also had a significant employment spin-off, with 1,150 jobs created so far. Irish Water made a number of social inclusion commitments at the outset of the programme and, as a result, 57% of the jobs created have gone to SMEs, 22% to people who were previously on the live register and a further 8% to graduates, apprentices and school leavers. Irish Water has committed to accelerating the metering programme such that it will be completed in mid-2016 rather than at the end of that year. This will mean that up to 450,000 meters will be installed by the end of 2014, a very significant achievement, and that approximately 1.05 million meters will be installed by mid-2016. Approximately 300,000 properties are not being addressed as part of the current programme. They include apartment blocks and other multi-occupancy buildings, houses with shared service connections and properties where the connection to the mains cannot be identified. In order to increase metering penetration, Irish Water commissioned a study to examine ways of metering these categories of property. My Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase which could involve metering approximately 48,000 apartments identified by the report as being feasible for cost-effective metering. In addition, a programme will be finalised in the coming weeks to allow customers to "opt-in", where the householders know or can identify a connection point. Water charges for households will be introduced on 1 October 2014, with the first bills to be issued after 1 January 2015. In order to protect the interests of customers, the Government has established an independent economic regulator for water services within the Commission for Energy Regulation. The role of the regulator is set out in the Water Services Acts 2013 and the legislation specifically requires the regulator to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. Under the legislation, Irish Water's tariffs must be set out in a water charges plan which will be subject to the approval of the regulator. The regulator will undertake extensive public consultation before making a final determination on the level of tariffs. Last month the regulator commenced a public consultation process on the structure and design of tariffs for both households and non-domestic users. The regulator will be undertaking further consultations in June before announcing the details of the tariffs in August this year. The regulator also has wider role in customer protection. Under the Water Services Act, Irish Water is required to prepare and submit codes of practice to the commission. These codes of practice will address matters such as standards in Irish Water's services; billing by Irish Water; methods of payment; the provision of information for customers; and the standards of service customers should expect. The regulator also has the power to direct Irish Water to prepare a code of practice on any matter the regulator considers necessary to protect the interests of the customers of Irish Water. Is it not refreshing to have some honesty in politics at last and clarity on this issue of water charging? Paddy now knows what the charge will be. It is galling to listen to the hypocritical cant from people like Deputy Niall Collins who talked about cynicism. Fianna Fáil invented the words "political cynicism" and is stating the complete opposite to what its leader signed the country up to when he signed the memorandum of understanding in 2010. Earlier today the Government agreed the details of the funding model for Irish Water, including a range of measures to support the affordability of water charges. First and foremost, the subvention to be paid to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016 will be conditional on the average domestic charge per household not exceeding €240 per year. Each household will receive a very generous allowance of 30,000 litres of drinking water and a corresponding wastewater allowance each year. An additional free allowance up to 38,000 litres per annum will be provided for households for each child under the age of 18 years.This is based on a child's normal consumption of water but the level of consumption underpinning the allowance will be verified by actual metering data. The result of the additional free allowance for children is that water charges will effectively only apply to adults. Those free allowances and affordability measures will continue post-2016.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	What about the €400 that the previous Government was going to charge everybody in 2010? Fianna Fáil's leader signed up to it. People are able to read. They are not stupid. The subsidy provided to members of group water schemes will be adjusted to be aligned with the free allowance approach for public water supplies. This will ensure that the sector receives equivalent support while at the same time allowing for transitional actions which may be required to sustain improvements in water quality. Fianna Fáil can scrap the canvassing literature where it says that rural people will have to pay these water charges. There will be no charge on private wells or for those on group water schemes who get their water from private water sources. It is my intention to use the powers provided to me under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to issue a statutory direction to the regulator requiring it to take a number of issues into account to ensure that charges are implemented in a manner that is fair and equitable. This will include fixing the first domestic water tariffs it approves until the end of 2016. It will also reflect the Government decision that charges should be capped for people with high water usage due to medical conditions. The precise conditions of this will be determined in consultation with the Minister for Health. The direction will also require that for social and environmental reasons there should be no standing charge for domestic customers, but there may be a minimum charge for properties that are not permanently occupied - for example, holiday homes. The direction will also address the need for assessed charges for customers who have not been metered by the time charges commence to be based primarily on occupancy to ensure they are as close a proxy for metered usage as possible. The assessed charges will be refined if required as more and more properties are metered and consumption data become available. The direction will also address the need for the CER to make provision for retrospective adjustment of charges, including rebates - above a reasonable threshold - in the context of transitional arrangements for customers who are moving from assessed charges to metered charges and the need for Irish Water to take account of the quality of services it provides to customers, including circumstances in which services are reduced or restricted - for example, due to boil water notices. The Government recognises that the domestic metering programme will highlight a significant number of properties where water usage is very high due to leakages on the property. To support water conservation and prevent households from being faced with large water bills, Irish Water will be introducing a first fix scheme which will provide each household with a free fix of the first leak on the customer's water supply pipe. The cost of this programme is estimated at €51 million. The announcement today provides certainty to households around the level of water charges that will be involved when the first bills are issued next year. An average charge of €240 for domestic customers in Ireland will compare very favourably internationally. In tandem with agreeing the level of Government subvention to Irish Water for 2015 and 2016 which will ensure that the average tariff does not exceed this level, the Government has also agreed to provide funding to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016 to allow for a more ambitious capital investment programme. It has been agreed that this programme will be increased by €200 million over the next two years. This demonstrates the commitment of the Government to accelerate investment in our water services infrastructure to deal with the historical deficits bequeathed to this Government by its predecessors and provide a reformed water sector with a greater resilience and level of quality. Before I conclude, it is worth recalling that when this Government took office we were required to implement commitments given by the previous Government to the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank. One of those commitments provided for the introduction of domestic water charges with no provision for metering by the end of 2012. This Government decided that water charges should be based on metered consumption, as this is the fairest way to charge for water, and we have put in place the measures and structures to achieve this. We also secured agreement to defer the introduction of water charges until the final quarter of 2014 rather than 2012, which was the year in which the previous Government thought they should be implemented. I will conclude by saying that, like the commitments contained in the programme for Government, the commitments that were made to provide clarity on the level of charges have been honoured. This Government has delivered on its plans for reform and will continue to deliver with the aim of ensuring we have a first-class water services and one which is affordable for consumers.

I very much welcome the clarity the Minister has brought to the subject. Coming from a constituency in rural Ireland, I am frequently asked about group water schemes and people who are not on the public water supply. It has been clarified that such people will not pay water charges. In some respects, water charges were implemented many years ago in rural Ireland with these group water schemes, but it is important that this clarification was given tonight. I very much welcome the announcement by the Government earlier today relating to the average charge, which is far less than the figure of €400 per annum suggested by the previous Government. I understand it was also suggested previously that there would be no allowances. It is a pity that any charges must be implemented, but given the financial situation the country has found itself in, we will be like all other countries in Europe that have water charges.  I also welcome the fact that there will be free water allowances for children and that vulnerable groups with medical conditions, people living alone or those with lower incomes were taken into account in the announcements today. That is very important. I have been listening for the past month or two to people saying there would be no announcements until after the local and European elections. I welcome the fact that there is now clarity on the matter. There should also be clarity on an ongoing basis between now and the end of the year because in many respects it is only when people go to write a cheque or pay some charge that they focus on how these charges are to be paid, and many questions come up at that stage. We have seen this with the household charge and the property tax, so it is important that there be a continuous system of information setting out clear amounts and ways to pay.  The additional €200 million that will be invested over the next two years is the least that is needed to fix leaks and improve the standard of water. I note that the Sinn Féin motion calls for water rates to be basically scrapped. I would not have a major problem with that if there was a property charge akin to that paid in the Six Counties.

Sinn Féin now states that it put off individual water charges to houses until after 2016, so does that mean that people in Northern Ireland will be paying water charges in addition to the sums of £1,200 and £1,500 they are paying at the moment? Clarity is needed in Northern Ireland as well, and I hope that when Sinn Féin debates this, it will clarify the situation. The announcement today is welcome, but there is a need for further information as the year goes on so that people are clear about the situation.A good suggestion was made to me recently which should be considered, that is, the putting in place of a facility to allow people to pay as they use water. In that way, people would not have a significant bill coming in every quarter. Such a payment option would allow people to have more control over the size of their bills. This suggestion was made to Irish Water but received a negative response. I ask the Minister to raise this matter with Irish Water again because it is an option that some people would take. As I understand it, next January a property tax bill and a water charges bill will arrive in people's homes at almost the same time. There is a need to stagger those two bills, particularly in the context of what is an expensive time for a lot of households, following the Christmas period. Some fine tuning of the bills is required.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I wish to raise the issue of the post offices and the sustainability of the post office network. I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that he will encourage all Departments to make as much use of the post office network as possible. The post office network has done a tremendous job with the passport service and with facilitating payment of property tax bills. I hope that the post offices will be allowed to deliver a water charges payment service to the same standard as the other services it provides.  I will conclude now by saying that while I welcome the clarity provided today, there is a need for continued clarity between now and January 2015.

It is a power-sharing Executive in the North and not a Government as we understand it in this State. We are using our contacts in the other parties to try to retain that position. I would urge Deputy O'Mahony - seeing as he is showing concern for the good people of the Six Counties in the north-east corner of Ireland - to use his influence with any contacts he may have in the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Alliance Party or any of the other parties with whom we share power in the North. It is a power-sharing arrangement and I am happy to explain that to Deputy O'Mahony because perhaps he was not aware of it. If he has any contacts in those parties I would urge him to do the same as what Sinn Féin is doing.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	In fact, his party might even decide to run for election in the North. I wanted to put that issue to bed before speaking on the substantive issue. I am speaking in support of our amendment which calls for the scrapping of water charges and the return of control of water services to democratically elected, reformed local authorities rather than leaving it in the hands of the corporate monster that Irish Water is becoming. We also call for a statutory assurance that water services will not be privatised in the future. Many members of the public suspect that once the cash register goes into the footpath outside their front door, the threat of privatisation is there. I have heard politicians say in the past that Bord Gais and many other State bodies would not be privatised but we have seen what happened in that regard.  While I welcome the fact that Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion and allowed more time to debate the issues surrounding water, we should not forget the fact that it was that party which agreed to establish a separate utility and to introduce water charges. Now we have some Fianna Fáil candidates in this State saying they want to abolish water charges and I have seen public meetings advertised to that effect. Back in December 2010 a memorandum of understanding was put in place and the then Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government agreed to establish a new entity, to take the control of water services away from local authorities and to introduce water charges. It is a bit hypocritical of Fianna Fáil to pretend that it is now concerned about the impact of water charges on householders, many of whom are already struggling to keep their heads above water. It is also true, as the current Government spokespersons have said, that Fianna Fáil would have implemented water charges at a much higher rate and much sooner, in 2012. That is a fact and is on the record. These are not my words - Fianna Fáil put them on paper. It is also worth pointing out that the Labour Party promised, during the 2011 election campaign, to prevent Fine Gael from going ahead with its commitment to introduce an average annual domestic charge of €238. Indeed, it ran Tesco-style advertisements prior to the general election lambasting the proposals of its now partners-in-government to levy a water tax and highlighting how the Labour Party would stop them. Not only did the Labour Party not stop them; the average charge being talked about now is €2 higher than the rate the party promised to prevent being imposed. The party has retreated so far from the high moral ground it sought to occupy in 2011 that it is now boasting about having introduced a charge which it said it was totally opposed to in the first place.  The rate at which Fianna Fáil was planning to charge for water reflects the overall cost of the running of our water services. The average rate proposed by the Government would only cover half of that. It has said that the shortfall will be made up initially by subvention, taken either from the local property tax or the Exchequer. How will the costs be met in future years? Will the local property tax be used every year to prop up and support Irish Water and the monster it is becoming? It is already the case that the local property tax fund, which was meant to pay for local amenities such as footpaths, public lighting, libraries and parks - I have heard those words from Deputy Hogan, the Taoiseach and others on the Government benches countless times in the last two years - has been taken away from the local authorities and 85% of it, or €486 million, is being used to subvent Irish Water. In effect, for the first year at least, householders are paying two new taxes. The real average cost initially will not be an average of €240 but a combination of the two charges - the property tax and the water charges. Add them together and one arrives at the total figure that people will pay for this service. The troika, with Fianna Fáil acquiescence, was looking for a charge of up to €500 or more to cover the full cost of providing water services for domestic and commercial users. The EU Water Framework Directive insists that this must happen. This State had a derogation since 1997 from the directive. Does that derogation still exist? Annexe 3 of Article 9 sets out that member states must conduct an economic analysis to determine the rate at which the cost of water supply and waste disposal be charged to households, agriculture and industry. Has such an analysis been conducted here? What findings did it come up with? I would suggest that such an analysis would provide a much more definite guide to what people will end up paying than the average suggested here today. The economist Richard Tol, writing in The Sunday Business Post, calculated that if the EU insisted that all of the cost of providing water services be accounted for through water charges, the average charge per household would be more like €560. How then can the Minister propose that the average charge of €240 per household, with a further €200 million in commercial rates, is adequate to pay for the overall cost of running Irish Water? This does not even take account of the millions in legacy debt which will be taken on by Irish Water, money which was borrowed in the past for the upkeep of water services.The hangover from expensive PPPs is still there, including 30-year contracts brought in during the boom years at boom-time prices. I know the Government cannot do anything about that, but the legacy is still there.  Many people will be initially pleased by the promise that households will receive 30,000 litres free every year but the average household use, based on a family of four, is six times that figure. Given that the average rate charge for any usage above 30,000 will have to increase, many people will inevitably pay far more than the €240 suggested by the Minister.  Averages are a poor guide to anything. If one household is paying €120 while another pays €360, it makes an average of €240. That is the way it will be, but it is a meaningless figure that bears no relation whatsoever to what people are actually paying. That is what will happen with water charges. Some people, depending on the composition of their household and other factors, will end up paying vastly more than we are being led to believe.  I do not buy the claim from Labour that the so-called concessions they extracted are based on social justice. I accept there will be exemptions for people with medical conditions and a couple of other exemptions within narrow parameters. Outside of that, however, there are no indications as to where the burden will fall. Neither is there any indication of how the shortfall in charges and the absence of a standing charge will be made up. There are growing legions of people on low pay, including thousands of workers on zero-hour contracts. Some of them are not even getting the minimum wage because, although they may have been in a job for two years, they are told that they are training. They are still being paid €7 or €7.50 an hour, but employers get around it by claiming they are training. They are being trained to do the most menial jobs that a person could learn in half a day or, in some cases, half an hour.  There is no reprieve for the unemployed or those on low pay. Neither is there any reprieve for those struggling to pay mortgages. The shortfall will have to be made up by charging a higher rate, which is a key point that the Minister is not telling people about. There will be a higher rate for the quantity of water used that exceeds the free allowance. It is no more than a smoke and mirrors job. The Government is just moving the figures around and holding back until after the election. We have seen promises before to exempt those on low incomes from bin charges, for example, but they were not kept. Under this Government, the experience of people is that once a new tax or cut is implemented the impact will become more, not less, as time goes on. The proposed waiver scheme is simply a ploy. It is a fig-leaf to get the Government parties, and particularly the Labour Party, through the election. Like the waiver scheme for waste collection, it will disappear, as it did in the counties where that existed previously.  For the past two or three weeks, Ministers have been at the Cabinet table discussing the pressure on the Labour Party rather than the pressure on households. That is what they have been debating in the corridors of Leinster House. The issue has not been the pressure on households or low-paid workers, but the pressure on the Government parties, particularly Labour, in the run up to the elections. The figures are there. The Government is wasting €530 million putting meters outside front doors. The Tánaiste said that as there is currently a loss of water of about 40% in the system, the structure of the charging regime would encourage incentivised conservation. Somebody should tell the Tánaiste that the 40% is being lost out of the mains network. That is what all the engineers are saying. How will charging the householder at the other end of the system stop those leaks two or three miles down the road? How will that happen? I have never read such a statement in all my life. Today, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, said there would be an additional €200 million over two years for Irish Water's capital investment to include a free first-fix scheme providing each household with a free fix of the first leak on a customer's water supply pipe. Irish Water will be outlining its proposed capital programme, subject to CER approval, in the coming weeks. Can the Minister tell me what that extends to? Is it 2 m of the pipe beyond the stop-cock? Is it as far as the front or back wall of a house? What exactly does that mean? It seems deliberately vague to me. People reading that today may feel happy but when they see what it actually means they will find that a very restrictive scheme is being put in place. It is a sop to soften any opposition to what is being done. The cost of this includes €530 million on meters and €180 million setting up the corporate monster that is Irish Water, yet not one leak has been fixed as a result of that expenditure. There will be a call centre with hundreds of workers. As I understand it, 500 new staff are being employed in Uisce Éireann, some of whom will earn over €100,000 a year. That is on top of an existing local authority system. We already have the call centres. They are called Áras an Chontae or Áras an Chathair. Clerical, administrative and engineering staff are already there in the local authorities' water services, yet the Government has created a corporate monster which is being superimposed on those structures. It has turned local authorities into mere subcontractors to be hired and fired.  The councillors who will be democratically elected in a couple of weeks time will be given the number of a call centre to contact. Those are the facts of it. Up to now, councillors quite rightly had a direct input into making water services plans. Deputies could make representations to county managers. However, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have joined hands together to set up a separate structure. In some other countries, water services have been taken back under the control of local authorities because this is a fragmented service. It cannot be managed centrally unless one injects huge amounts of money into a large bureaucracy. It is a fragmented service because every county has hundreds of water sources. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, knows that coming from Sligo, while Deputy John Browne from Wexford knows it also. I know it is the case, coming from Laois-Offaly.  There are hundreds of small and large water schemes, which cannot be run centrally unless it is done by a huge bureaucracy. That is what the Government is creating but it should return control of water to reformed local authorities. That power should be given back to local authorities, rather than wasting money on meters and establishing Uisce Éireann. We need to fix the leaks.

Some people may say that we have to pay for water usage and that we cannot continue to have free water, but we never had free water in this country. The €1.2 billion cost of producing water across the country has been paid for all along by central taxation, so there has never been free water. Car tax contributed to water services, so will we get a reduction in motor taxation due to the introduction of water tax? No, we will not. Water tax is being introduced to allow the Government to pay the €9 billion in interest payments on the unjustified bank debt that every one of us must carry as a burden. Therefore there is no such thing as free water because we have been paying for it already. We will now be paying for it on the double because of the introduction of water charges.  Over the last three weeks or so, we have been treated to the charade of the Labour Party throwing its toys out of the pram in Cabinet and wanting to get what it calls benefits for people who cannot afford water charges. We have seen the rigmarole of today's agreement on water charges.What we see out of the agreement is that the average charge per house for water in 2015 will be the same as was suggested four weeks ago - that is, €240 per house. In fact, it has gone up by €2 from the initial figure of €238. There has been no change. The average cost of water per house will still be €240. All the Government has done is to give a small consideration to people who must use extra water because of illness. People who cannot afford to pay water charges will have the privilege of going to the community welfare officer to ask for some discretionary contribution to the cost of water bills. The same system is already in place for people's ESB and other utility bills and it has proven extremely difficult for them to obtain support from community welfare officers. It will be just as difficult for someone to get support in paying their water charges. There has been no concession for people who will have difficulty paying. There is nothing in the scheme for them. The Government has made much play of the fact that there will be 30,000 litres of free water for each household. I heard the Minister refer earlier to how generous the allocation is. It is interesting to look at existing commercial customers which have a domestic element in their billing process. Their free allowance at the moment is 227,000 litres. Those who are already paying water charges - commercial customers with a domestic element - will see their free allowance reduced by a factor of 7.5. A couple living in rural Ireland offering bed and breakfast accommodation which is metered by the local authority will see their free allowance reduced from 227,000 litres to 30,000. This is the extremely generous allowance the Government has implemented. It means those people will pay more for their water supply in 2015 than they did this year. Much has been made by IBEC and other business interests of how commercial water charges will have to be reduced now that Irish Water has come into play. However, people with a commercial element in their water bills who live over the shop, pub or post office or operate a small bed and breakfast will see their charges increase significantly because the Government has wiped out the free allowance that is already there. Why was that allowance not used as the model for delivering a free allowance nationally? If one takes the average charge of €240, Irish Water's own figures, circulated today in a frequently-asked-questions document, show that we will have a unit price of approximately €2.25 per cubic meter. That is the price the CER will come out with in the coming months.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	My Department works closely with the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and the Health Service Executive (HSE) to identify and address medicines shortages so as to minimise their impact on the market. Each year a number of medicines are withdrawn from the Irish market for commercial reasons. Manufacturers are obliged to notify the IMB of their intention to withdraw a medicine from the market. When they intend to withdraw a critical product for which there is no alternative in Ireland, they must notify the HSE nine months in advance to give it and the IMB the opportunity to source an alternative product for the Irish market. The IMB engages with manufacturers to facilitate continuity of supply of all medicines and particularly critical medicines on the market. Among the steps taken by the IMB are an expedited review of submissions for authorisation and the facilitation of joint packs with other EU markets to improve efficiencies for manufacturers. In terms of best value for patients, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 means that patients may now opt for lower cost interchangeable medicines, where available.

The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended. It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response. Contact information has issued to Oireachtas members.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework. As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees. The Government is providing new, additional funding of €37 million to meet the cost of this measure which will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children that must currently pay to see a GP. The implementation of this new service requires primary legislation. In that respect, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 was published on 23 April 2014. The key features of this Bill are as follows: - it provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees;- it removes the need for children aged under 6 to have a GMS medical card or GP visit card in order to qualify for a GP service;- it provides that the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of this service to children; and - it provides that the Minister may set the rates of fees payable to GPs for this service, though requiring that the Minister must follow a set process before doing so. It is intended to introduce the Bill in the Oireachtas during May, with a view to enactment by July. Payments can only be made to GP's where the requisite legislation and contractual arrangements are in place. Therefore, payments related to the provision of the GP service without fees for children aged 5 and under cannot be backdated, prior to when the service is available, to the date on which the measure was announced.

With the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, I attended the signing of the contract for the N17/N18 Gort Tuam PPP on Wednesday 30 April 2014.  The contracting authority is the National Roads Authority and this scheme is a non-tolled PPP.  The contract consortium is Direct Route, whose members include Roadbridge, John Sisk, Lagan, three large Irish civil engineering firms and Strabag of Austria. The Gort-Tuam PPP project is one of a number of road projects identified in the Government's Financial Stimulus Package. Now that the contract has been concluded and signed the NRA will be in a position to prepare the project implementation schedule.The NRA has allocated €3.25m to the project in 2014. The expected construction time for this project is 3.5 years and the project is expected to be completed in 2018.  Overall scheme value is approximately €550 million.

The period of validity of a certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) is calculated by reference to the last test due date. In cases where a vehicle is overdue its test by more than one year and is presented for testing, current Regulations provide that the period of validity for the CRW shall be either 6 months falling after the testing date or a period of validity determined by reference to the date of the anniversary of the test due date whichever is earlier. This change was introduced so as to ensure that an operator who does not have the vehicle tested by the due date does not gain economic advantage over an operator who had their vehicle tested annually in accordance with the legal requirements.
