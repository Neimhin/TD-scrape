          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Brian Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish an interdepartmental inquiry to investigate the granting of citizenship outlined in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 5 in Dáil Éireann on 17 October 2002, with a view to establishing whether the applications for the 11 citizenships granted by the former Minister, Ray Burke, were validly grounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the implications of the proposed sale of 4.65 acres by Great Southern Hotels immediately adjacent to Killarney railway station and the likely adverse impact on the development of services and car parking facilities thereat.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matter raised by Senator Hayes as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule Senator Coghlan's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_6">The Order of Business today is Nos. 1, statements on crime, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators five minutes, to conclude not later than 1 p.m. and on which Members may share time; and No. 2, motion on Seanad reform (resumed). The Whips are to meet to discuss arrangements for No. 2 as they did not have time to do so this morning. The debate may or may not conclude today, but we should be able to work out a likely timetable when the Whips meet. Senator Higgins is currently in possession on this matter and has eight minutes left for his contribution. On this item, Members have 20 minutes each and may share time.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">I thank the Leader. Will she inquire from the Government about the latest state of play with regard to the funding of the GAA's project to fully complete the development of Croke Park? I understand that the total sum of money involved for this development will be in the region of €240 million. When one considers that the Government has already given €70 million to the project and that the GAA is seeking a further €40 million, the total taxpayer's allocation will come to 40% of the estimated overall cost. Would it be possible for the Minister to obtain a commitment from the Government that, before additional funding is forwarded to the GAA for the purpose of completing Croke Park, two guarantees will be sought from the association, namely, that it will agree to provide the Croke Park facilities for the 2008 European Championships and, more importantly, that it will agree to open up what is a magnificent stadium to soccer, rugby and other sports?</p>
          <p eId="para_12">It is ridiculous that we have a wonderful national stadium in Croke Park which cannot be used for any other purposes, particularly as taxpayers have contributed 40% of the total cost of the redevelopment project. In light of the downturn in the public finances and the need to extend sporting opportunities, we must obtain the guarantees to which I refer from the GAA before additional public money is committed to the organisation. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Government.</p>

In past debates on crime and alcohol, Members have always noted that the nub of the issue revolves around how people use their time. Whatever our views on the principal issue of funding the GAA, it should be recognised that this organisation has a major input to Irish society in terms of guiding young people in a positive way. While I understand the points raised by Senator Hayes – I do not disagree with his fundamental argument – I do not believe that significant conditions should be attached to the operations of a great national organisation which makes a huge contribution to Irish life. I did not intend to make a contribution on this matter. However, the Cathaoirleach nodded to me and I believe he felt that Senator Hayes's remarks were being made in a vacuum.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">When the issue of clerical child abuse was raised yesterday, we asked the Leader to consider engaging with the Government or the appropriate Minister in order to arrange a debate. Our requests for a such a debate were not rhetorical because this matter must be discussed. As stated yesterday, we are not shooting from the hip on this, we are merely raising the issues as they arise. I would like a transparent investigation of the sort of agenda pursued by those people who tried to object to young children obtaining the information and confidence they need to protect themselves against abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Senator Norris made the point yesterday that in a previous debate Members heatedly argued that it was completely wrong that the church could be exempt from certain parts of the equality legislation. Under the law of the land teachers can be sacked for holding an inappropriate set of beliefs, whereas people in the church found guilty of child abuse do not have to take responsibility for their actions. They continue blithely on their way as priests, which is wrong. To reaffirm my comments yesterday, I ask the Leader to bring forward an outline plan of how we might rectify this and make a valid contribution to the debate. We will not go away.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">Yes, it was upheld by the Supreme Court. I agree with Senator O'Toole. Our debate should not impinge on the criminal investigations, which I hope are now ongoing, but we need to reflect on the institutional arrangements in the State, the degree to which they can be used to cover up the crimes of individuals and, to the degree that it exists, how the well-being of an institution is assumed to be more important than the well-being of children. We need to look at issues such as the claims now emerging and the advice given in guides on Canon Law. It is not particularly about one institution but institutional arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">There should be a debate on the funding of sports organisations. I have always believed the GAA is the softest target in the country. If one is going to do sums about taxpayer support for organisations, one should look at the contribution to the overall funding of the organisation. There is a pitch in virtually every parish and a clubhouse in every second parish into which went very little taxpayer's money. If one looks at the total capital investment of the GAA in the last 20 years, the proportion of funding that came from the taxpayer is shamefully small given the contribution it makes to society. We should not talk about issues such as Croke Park in isolation. I am seeking a debate on the funding of sports organisations generally because the record of successive Governments on this issue is nothing less than shameful.</p>

I proposed some years ago that we should join central European time, even if the British do not come with us. As I said on a previous occasion, we should be willing to leave the nursery, even if nanny does not come with us. I have no wish to bring the matter up, but this is the appropriate week to do so. We should become part of Europe in this regard. There are benefits in social terms and for business and sport. More importantly, the evidence from the United Kingdom indicates that the number of road accidents would be reduced if daylight saving time was introduced. It makes sense. I will not make the case now, but urge the Leader to remind the relevant Minister of the need to look again at this matter.</p>

This dispute will have dire consequences for the farming community, meat exporters and workers employed in the plants. It is vital that somebody intervenes in the dispute as a matter of urgency. If the Leader finds the Minister is unwilling to intervene, perhaps she would use her considerable experience and her office in this House to intervene and bring both parties together in order that the dispute can be satisfactorily resolved. It is criminal that it has been allowed to continue during this critical time for the farming community.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">With regard to GAA funding, I have had the privilege of being to Croke Park and it is a superb facility of which any country could be proud. I am delighted a wonderful place. On the other hand, there is good reason for us to look impartially at the funding arrangements. I remember, some years ago, examining data on lottery funding and page after page referred to funding for the GAA. Perhaps it is justified and maybe, as its members have said, it provides a valuable infrastructure that keeps small rural communities together. There is no doubt, however, that disproportionately massive funding goes to the GAA. Perhaps it is deserved but that is a fact. If Senators want the facts I will bring them to the House for the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Following on from what a number of Senators said yesterday, I support strongly what Senator O'Toole said concerning the horrible and shameful subject of the sexual abuse of children. Will the Leader request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring to the House at an early date a re-examination of all equality legislation for precisely the reasons that Senator O'Toole and I have raised?</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I wish to put a point on the record in order to advance the case. I am a Member of this House, in good standing. Certain schools in this country are paid for by taxpayers' money. Although I am a person of good character, I could be fired legally because I advocated homosexual law reform and because I acknowledged publicly that this is my sexual orientation. According to the laws of the land, the church authorities could fire me from a job paid for by taxpayers' money, while simultaneously protecting people who abused hundreds of children. I am in favour of discrimination on the basis of behaviour so that children can be protected, but I am not in favour of discriminatory attitudes which harm people of otherwise good character. As legislators we now have an opportunity to address this issue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">All Governments have found themselves in this situation. The first time Senator O'Toole, myself and others discussed this point, we were arguing against a very progressive Labour Minister, Mervyn Taylor. He was not a conservative but, due to pressure from the churches, he found it impossible to act. As a result of these scandals, that pressure has weakened and this House can do an important job of reform by removing those exemptions by way of amendment to the equality legislation. The Minister should bring the legislation before the House once more.</p>

I am calling for such a debate in light of the fact that local authority members and Members of the Oireachtas regularly visit Irish communities in America, Australia and elsewhere. We should examine the possibility of economic opportunities, harnessing the Irish diaspora around the world by using electronic methods to link up the participants in such a debate. Tele-conferencing could bring together members of the diaspora from as far apart as Dubai, Australia, Thailand, America, London and other places where Irish communities exist. I am encouraged by the board mindedness of debates in the House and we should promote that as much as possible.</p>

It transpires that the fine for non-attendance at the coroner's court is a mere €5. It is obvious, therefore, that the Coroners Act is grossly outdated and there is an urgent need to revise the penalties. We need to examine how we can redress a situation where somebody who is centrally involved in someone's death can fail, with virtual impunity, to turn up at the coroner's court which is attempting to establish the cause of death. The Leader should bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as it needs to be addressed urgently.</p>

He also mentioned the need to open up Croke Park – a wonderful facility – to other games in light of the joint Irish-Scottish bid to host the 2008 European football championships. I hope that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will address the House in the near future when that issue can be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I agree with Senator O'Toole's call for a rational and responsible debate on clerical child abuse and he has asked me to outline plans for such a debate. The leaders of the groups should meet to plan the structure of the debate and see who we would invite to participate in it. We want to contribute to the debate and do not wish to hinder any such discussion. We will arrange that after meeting with the group leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Senator Ryan said that the reputation of an institution is often assumed to be more important than the individuals who are in its employment. Several Members, including myself, alluded obliquely to such a case where a teacher was sacked for what was perceived then to be a particular lifestyle with which the churches did not agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">The debate on clerical child abuse has also thrown up the issue of church-State relationships. Many countries which have a separation of church and state still have huge trouble concerning clerical abuse, so I am not blaming it on that. However, there is a parallel implicit debate beginning to emerge about church-State relationships, which is a whole other issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Senator Quinn does not want us to lose the hour.

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_100">I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the issue of crime. It is a broadranging issue and obviously, from what has transpired just before my arrival, many Senators have a great deal to say on different aspects of today's debate. I will watch my back on the monitors but I think I am all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">It would be somewhat artificial in current circumstances not to say that crime, as a concept, is an issue of huge latitude, but sexual abuse of young people is a very serious crime and must be treated as such. The Government is considering carefully what steps it proposes to take to address the issues that have been brought to public attention in recent days by the "Prime Time" programme and by other media programmes and publications.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">This is of such importance that it is equally important to avoid knee-jerk reactions. It is important to make sure that everything we do is measured and effective. Without rehearsing matters which have been dealt with elsewhere, and doubtless will be dealt with in this House on another occasion, I state clearly that, as far as our system of law is concerned, no one is beneath its protection and no one is above its reach. It applies across the board and to everyone. As we are citizens of a Republic, the law is the law of the Republic and is not inferior to, or even on a co-equal status with, any private law.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Having made those points, it is important to emphasise to the House that the Garda Síochána is taking steps to strengthen and sharpen its capacity to deal with crimes of sexual abuse against children. The criminal law, such as it is, is a matter, not for direction by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to how individual investigations should be carried out, but for enforcement by the Garda Síochána in partnership with the Director of Public Prosecutions. Any resources needed to counter and detect cases of child abuse will be made available by my Department to the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Senators will be aware that the statistics furnished by the Garda Commissioner in relation to headline or serious offences for 2001 are disappointing and very worrying. Although in the period 1996 to 2000 the figures for recorded indictable crime showed a decrease of approximately 27%, the trend, regrettably, altered in 2001 when Garda statistics indicated an overall increase of 18% over the previous year. Although these figures are obviously a cause for major concern, they also reflect the targeting of resources and the resultant increased activity on the part of the Garda Síochána in addressing this problem. This is confirmed by the detection rate of 75% in the assault category and 87% in the homicide category.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The increase in the number of public order incidents has led to serious and, in some cases, fatal injuries. This is a major cause of concern to the Government. I know that all Senators will share my concern at the death of a young man who so tragically lost his life in Dublin last week and that they join me in extending sympathy to his family and the families of other recent victims of similar heinous crimes. I am convinced that the serious nature of these crimes underlines the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to changing levels and patterns of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">In order to address the problems associated with public order, I have reintroduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, which, when enacted, will give the Garda Síochána significant additional powers to assist it in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink-related late night disturbances and the growing problem of late night street violence, which have their origins in or outside licensed premises, fast food outlets, night clubs and the like in urban areas. It applies to pubs, off-licences, discos, night clubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles. Existing Garda powers in this area will be strengthened. The Bill will extend the sanctions that may be imposed on offenders under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Many, including several Members of this House, have expressed concern about the contribution of under age drinking to the problem of public disorder. Establishing the incidence of under age drinking and associated public disorder in an empirically sound fashion is a very difficult task as statistics in relation to non-headline crime are not usually disaggregated according to the age of the offender. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that under age drinking undoubtedly contributes to the problem, although I do not wish to overstate this contribution in the context of the behaviour of young adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 was designed to make it as difficult as possible for persons under the age of 18 years to be sold alcohol, to be in possession of it or consume it other than in a private residence. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 strengthened the law in this regard by providing for the removal of the reasonable belief defence of licence holders in selling alcohol to under age persons and by providing that where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under age person is upheld, the licensed premises may be closed for a specified period. From the date of commencement of the Act in the year 2000 to 23 September 2002, some 118 closure orders were made by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Moreover, statutory regulations have been introduced providing for the issuance of age cards to persons of or over 18 years of age, certifying that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. This so-called national age card scheme has proven to be considerably successful in making it that bit more difficult for under age persons to purchase alcohol, with approximately 70,000 cards having now been issued. To further promote the scheme, I also plan to initiate a €150,000 awareness campaign to highlight the desirability of the use of these age cards among both young adults and on and off-licensees.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Senators will be aware of the Garda operation named Operation Encounter, which was introduced in February this year and continues to focus on all issues of public order in the community. Particular attention is paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. The Garda strives to ensure the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. This will be given statutory force when the latest public order Bill becomes law. The operation has also increased the number of gardaí available to target locations where public order and assault offences are likely to be committed</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The Government regards the situation as one which requires in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of crime as well as priority action to deal with particular issues. Our response is multifaceted. The programme for Government includes proposals in relation to many of the issues I have already touched upon, such as innovative public order legislation, targeted Garda operations, a strict enforcement of the liquor licensing laws and an extension in the use of closed-circuit television systems. Of particular note in this list is the major expansion of Garda CCTV systems currently under way. Systems are due to be installed in the following 17 areas: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo and Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Of particular relevance to the issue of crime are the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, which is acknowledged as one of the most comprehensive youth justice statutes for generations. The Act sets out the manner in which Ireland will be dealing with offenders under the age of 18 years for the foreseeable future. For the benefit of new Members of the House, I will outline some of the provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The Act provides that for children at risk of becoming involved in offending or out-of-control non-offending children, family welfare conferences may be convened. This entirely preventative, inter-agency mechanism brings together the key participants, including the child and parents, to determine whether special care or protection is required or warranted. In addition, the existing Garda juvenile diversion programme will be established on a statutory basis as a means of dealing with the offending child who accepts responsibility for his or her behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">In cases where Garda discretion in the use of cautioning is inappropriate or has failed and the matter proceeds to the Children Court, provision is made for an adjournment of proceedings and the convening of a family conference in cases where the child accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour. The family conference, organised by the probation and welfare service, aims to formulate an action plan for the child, which may include an apology or reparation to the victim, participation by the child in appropriate sports or recreational activities, attendance at school or work, or participation in other recreational, training or educational courses that would not interfere with school or work. The court remains in ultimate control of this process, and if the terms of the action plan are not adhered to, charges against the child may be reinstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">In those cases where prosecution and conviction become unavoidable, in keeping with best international practice, the guiding principle is that detention should be an option of last resort. To effect this, provision is made for a number of forms of community sanction, many of which are entirely new within Irish law. Although imprisonment will not be an option for persons under the age of 18 years, it is recognised, nevertheless, that detention will always be required for a small number of young offenders for whom nothing else will work. Children of 12 years of age up to 16 years of age will be detained in child detention schools, which will have an educational rather than punitive ethos. Children of 16 and 17 years of age will be detained in dedicated, sex-segregated secure detention centres provided within our justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I also wish to mention the National Crime Council, which was established to facilitate broadly based and well informed discussion on crime on an ongoing basis and to serve as an important aid to policy formulation. I recently had the honour of attending briefly at a meeting of the council and one of the Members of this House is closely related to its chair. It was a pleasure to see an independent group of people setting about feeding well researched, objective and valuable information into our democratic debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">In November 2001, the council launched its first report, entitled Crime in Ireland, which provides an analysis of the official crime statistics from 1950 to 1998. This study was carried out by the Institute of Criminology in the Faculty of Law at University College Dublin and contains a set of recommendations from the council. On 26 July 2002, I obtained Government approval to implement two of the key recommendations, namely, the establishment of an expert group to review the collation and presentation of information relating to crime and the development of a biennial national crime victimisation survey. I understand that, later today, the National Crime Council will be launching a consultation document dealing with crime prevention partnerships, entitled Tackling the Underlying Causes of Crime – A Partnership Approach. I understand that the council will be making definitive recommendations to me on this matter in spring 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The council has also commissioned a research report to establish the levels of public order offences in Ireland, the likely contributory factors, including but not exclusively alcohol consumption, and a comparative analysis of the problem with countries of similar size to Ireland. The research is being undertaken by the Institute of Criminology and the results are due later this year, together with recommendations from the council. An advisory group has been appointed by the council to oversee the development of a national study of domestic violence. This study will be non-gender specific and will aim to provide a more accurate picture of the prevalence and nature of domestic violence in Ireland than is possible from official crime statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I pay tribute to the loyalty and service which the Garda Síochána has given and continues to give this State and its people. I was gratified by the findings of the recent public attitude survey commissioned by the Garda research unit which showed an 87% general public satisfaction rating with how the community is policed. However, we live in a world of change and the Garda Síochána must change along with the society it serves. I regard it as one of the highest priorities of my period in office to foster and support that trust between the Garda Síochána and the community and to do all I can to ensure that the values of the service endure in a modern setting. We all want a situation to prevail where police action is characterised by the highest standards of professionalism, probity and respect for the law and the Constitution. The maintenance of these standards in an era of change will require new structures and procedures to be put in place and principal among these is the proposed Garda inspectorate which the Government has committed itself to introduce.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The current Government programme lays down a firm commitment to deliver on this new inspectorate, which can independently instigate complaints or investigations against members of the service and which will, in that regard, have the powers of an ombudsman. The inspectorate will also exercise an independent day-to-day oversight of police operating standards. In addition to the proposed Garda inspectorate, there is already under way a substantial programme of change and reform within the Garda Síochána under the Strategic Management Initiative. I have already announced measures to provide for a new performance and accountability framework for the Garda Síochána to enable the service to meet the challenges ahead. The legislation to provide for all these measures is well advanced within my Department and I hope to publish it next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Senators will appreciate that it was only possible in this contribution to touch on some aspects of crime, criminology and the State's response to crime and policing. We face many other challenges, not least the issues of terrorism and organised crime. I hope that the Members of this House will not consider that, in visiting just a few flowers on the plant of the crime issue, I am in any way dismissive of the others. I assume that Members will not consider themselves confined in this series of statements to dealing with the issues I have raised, but will range far, wide and constructively on all issues in this category. I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for their attention and assure them that I will listen attentively to any and all suggestions they may wish to make.</p>

          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_124">I welcome the Minister to the House. His presence provides us with a great opportunity to hear his views on how he intends to tackle the very serious issue of crime on our streets. It also provides Members with an opportunity to relate to the Minister our serious concerns about how the level of crime, which is rising each year, is affecting people. The Minister said that he is extremely worried about this rise in crime as are Members on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The rise in crime in recent years is unacceptable to Members and to people on the streets. Parents fear for their children's lives each time they leave their houses. Elderly people are afraid to leave their homes at night and even fear for their lives within their homes. All can relate stories on this matter. One of my sons went to Temple Bar one night and suffered an unprovoked attack in which his nose and some teeth were broken. A garda was called to the incident but he simply told my son to go home. He did not even ask my son's name or for a description of the young boys who perpetrated this attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">I raise that story because I believe that a large number of crimes go unreported. Young children are at risk of being attacked on their way home from school for something as simple as a mobile phone. I share the sympathy the Minister extended to the family of the young boy who lost his life in a mobile phone robbery recently. The situation on the streets is almost a lawless one. Nobody knows the terror and hurt that people must put up with until they are affected themselves. Each of us, when affected by crime, wants something done but we need to do something on a general basis. The level of drunkenness, public disorder and crime on our streets has to be tackled urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I would like the Minister to take on board some suggestions. He said that he will increase the number of gardaí from 12,000 to 14,000 over the next couple of years. That will be extremely difficult for the Minister to achieve because of the number of gardaí retiring naturally at their retirement age. There is also an increasing number retiring before retirement age. With that drop-out rate, the Minister will not be able to secure the numbers he wants to reach the 14,000 target. I suggest that he considers providing an option for gardaí to stay on later than the limit of 57 years of age which is currently in force. Many gardaí enjoy their work and would happily stay on given the option, and if the circumstances were right for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">While people said that they are happy with the gardaí in their communities, they want more gardaí. If there were more, there would be a decline in the number of incidents of crimes. The Blanchardstown area, which I represent, has a population of 75,000. There are not enough community gardaí in the area and those that are there cannot perform their community policing duties as a consequence of pressures from other areas of the Garda Síochána's work. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this problem by providing an increased number of community gardaí in areas of high population. The presence of community gardaí would alleviate the problems I mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I agree with the Minister's opinion that CCTV is necessary and helps the Garda to identify the perpetrators of street crime. People would feel safer if more gardaí were present on the streets and if CCTV systems were in operation. The Minister should deliver CCTV to the places he mentioned in his speech, along with other areas, as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">A community initiative in Blanchardstown, organised in association with the probation and welfare service, caters for the immediate and long-term needs of ex-prisoners between the ages of 16 and 21. It concentrates on helping them to return to the community. Some 87% of such people in the Blanchardstown area are addicted to drugs and, worryingly, 27% of them are homeless. Some local initiatives under the probation and welfare service provide homes for the people to whom I refer and I believe further suggestions for such programmes are on the Minister's desk. Such services set young people goals to meet if they are to change their lives, for example, by placing them on training programmes. Many of the programmes are undertaken by ex-prisoners over a one year period while they are living in a residential community.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Many people doubt that the money needed to retain these services will be forthcoming from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is important that we continue to provide hope for 87 ex-prisoners in the Blanchardstown area, especially if we are to ensure that they do not re-offend. If the Department assists these programmes, it will benefit these people and, hopefully, prevent them from returning to a life of crime. They should be allowed to live in their communities rather than being taken away to places with which they have no association.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The Minister's speech referred to the sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy. I support his endeavours in this regard and I agree that he needs to take time to deal with the matter. He is correct that nobody is above the law as, for too long, people have hidden behind canon law. I appreciate the Minister's line that we will not allow that to happen again and he can be sure that he is supported by Senators on this side of the House in that regard. All of us must hang our heads in shame that we allowed such abuse to take place over such a long period. I am glad that people are coming forward to tell their stories and I hope they receive the help they require. Equally, I am pleased that the perpetrators of such terrible crimes will be dealt with properly and that they will no longer be allowed to hide behind closed doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">In my opinion, late night drinking, introduced about two years ago, has added to the level of street crime. This matter was not mentioned in the Minister's submission and I ask him to re-examine it. The level of crime has increased since the changes in the licensing laws were introduced. We should consider reinstating the former opening hours as excessive alcohol consumption causes so much crime and violence on our streets. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_134">I welcome the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to the House and I am delighted to speak about the issue of crime. I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement that the measures he proposes represent the tip of the iceberg in relation to targeted responses to crime. I welcome these reactive measures, however, as they are necessary. A long-term crime strategy should include an examination of the perpetrators of crime. Many criminals do not have a sense of belonging; they do not feel that they belong to a particular group. They do not share an ethos of responsibility and they have become disenfranchised from society through no fault of their own. The fact that they feel they do not belong to a structured group is related to changes in society over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">I worked on a youth project in Letterkenny for two years. I met the Minister in Ballybofey recently and I urge him to contact the Garda Síochána in Letterkenny the next time he is in County Donegal to ask for statistics about the Glenwood Park estate. A youth group, funded by a grant from the peace and reconciliation fund, was established to work with young people in the estate when it was known by a different name. I was employed as a youth worker there for two years from 1997. The people of the estate were labelled trouble makers and were seen as being constantly involved in crime. Young people on the estate were viewed as beyond the law and the rigours of society. My task was to establish homework clubs, to involve children in football and other sports, to get parents involved and, generally speaking, to engage the people of the estate in tasks to build up a team spirit. I was there for two years and another youth worker is employed there at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Having worked with people between the ages of 12 and 15, I am of the opinion that children can become disenfranchised from society if we do not work with them in their early teens. When I was in Letterkenny two nights ago, I saw the group I worked with two years ago, when they were 14 years of age, playing football. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were still playing together. A garda told me at the referendum count last Sunday that crime levels in the estate have decreased. A girl from the estate now attends NUI Maynooth, although I do not claim that her success is as a result of the youth project. We have to look at long-term crime prevention measures. I appreciate that the Minister said that all his initiatives were not mentioned in his speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The Youth Work Act, 2001, passed by the Oireachtas last year, gives more power to vocational education committees. Questions have to be asked, however, as many of the Act's provisions have yet to be implemented. I beseech the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to use his position of responsibility to ensure that the provisions are implemented without delay. Paid youth workers are needed on the ground as the day of voluntary input has passed, more or less. People will continue to offer their services voluntarily, but structures need to be established in non-formal environments, such as homework clubs and youth organisations. We need paid employees to work with young people on the ground in estates and other urban centres if we are to prevent crime.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_138">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire chun an Teach seo leis an díospóireacht tábhachtach seo. Undoubtedly, crime will be a priority for the Minister and the Government. Recent statistics were disappointing in that between 1996 and 2000 we saw a reduction of 27% in the level of indictable crime while now there has been an increase of 18% in one year. The Minister has initiated urgent analysis of the areas involved, but larceny and burglary account for over half of the increase, with more than 8,000 cases, while the number of drug offences has gone up by 33%, sexual offences by 83%, assaults by 93% and murders by 33%. As the Minister stated, however, detection rates for crimes such as murder are very high.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The adage that crime does not pay could be debated in the current climate. It has been debunked and is attributable to social change as much as anything else. When I was growing up, a teenager robbed some pennies from the church. The shame visited on his family and the stigma attached were a significant deterrent to those participating in crime. As we become more affluent, however, money rather than respect for values is a criterion for social measurement and, as a result, there is not the same respect for the law, personal property and individual rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Parental responsibility must be addressed. There is legislation in place, but it would be good to have it rigorously enforced. The values instilled in the home stay with people throughout their lives. Everyone here can identify individuals who have become involved in crime and will know that previous generations of the family have the same record. That cycle must be broken. The Minister, rightly, subscribes to the dictum that prevention is better than cure. He has stated he will tackle the causes of crime. Marginalisation, housing and educational and employment opportunities have been identified as causes. Figures are often quoted that the African American population of the USA represents a much greater proportion of the prison population than its numbers within the overall population.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Education must play a key role. The study of civics and the involvement of juvenile liaison officers would be helpful. Greater interaction between the Garda and schools, with effective programmes that could be conducted during transition year so as not to interfere with the curriculum, could be effective in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Some of the more liberal Members will disagree with me, but I wonder what role the removal of corporal punishment has played in the lack of discipline. Discipline is not held in the same regard as it was previously. It might be politically incorrect to say so – I do not condone past abuses of corporal punishment – but when I grew up. the odd slap on the hand did no harm. It kept us in our place. Are we becoming too politically correct?</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Sports organisations play a vital role. The GAA was mentioned on the Order of Business. Its contribution to society is enormous, as are those made by soccer, rugby and boxing clubs. In my town a young man was in difficulties with the law, but he went to England and became a British boxing champion at welterweight. When he returned, we hosted a civic reception and many of those involved in the boxing club acknowledged what the sport had achieved for him. They commented that but for his involvement in the sport, he might have followed a course that would have had a hugely detrimental effect on his whole life.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I spoke to the manager of the local soccer club recently when we were making an application to the national lottery for funding. I told him to include in the application that in 30 years of involvement with the club, only one young man ever got into trouble with the law. This club would train children from under 10 level right up, hundreds have passed through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The role and participation of gardaí and priests must be acknowledged. The positive contribution they make to clubs often goes unrecognised. I have seen gardaí involved in basketball and other clubs and this interaction gives people a respect for them and, as a consequence, the role they play in society. More of this should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">It is impossible to discuss this topic without looking at the Garda's enforcement role. The Garda works in a difficult environment in which few of us would choose to work. Often it interacts with the worst elements in society and its members put their own safety at risk in the interests of others. The system, however, should be examined. When there is good management locally, the performance of the Garda has been noticeably better. Where management is not up to that level, members of the force feel vulnerable because they feel that if they step over the line, as they may sometimes do, they take the brunt of the blame without any support from their superiors.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Diversity of duty should be examined. There is no reason traffic enforcement should be undertaken by the Garda. It could be policed effectively by a dedicated force such as the community warden system that operates at local authority level. Such arrangements apply successfully in other countries. The prime focus of the Garda should be on tackling crime and reducing crime rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">I welcome the increase of 2,000 in the number of gardaí. Resources are vital in this area because it is imperative that there are more gardaí on the beat. I have often discussed this with the local superintendent and when he explains where he has deployed personnel, 30 gardaí in a small town can find themselves spread across 24 hours in a way that is ineffective when it comes to being seen on the ground. There is no substitute for visibility and any initiative should ensure this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">This may be the era of equality, but I have seen instances of a young ban gharda being sent into the middle of a fracas on her own. That does not strike me as the best mechanism for resolving local difficulties. It has been commented on adversely by people who are good enough to fulfil their civic duty by telephoning the Garda and making them aware of the situation. I welcome the introduction of CCTV in 17 locations around the country, but I would like to see it extended to a greater number of towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The hands of gardaí are often tied because there is no tolerance of physical force. There was a sergeant in New Ross some years ago who was extremely effective, although it was to the detriment of his health. He often became involved in fracas and, because he was a champion boxer, he sorted them out effectively. I am not advocating a return to that, but our attitude must be balanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I have heard of instances where gardaí are verbally abused by young men who know that effective action cannot be taken against them. I have known gardaí who have gone to great trouble to get a successful prosecution only to see the young person who was taken away to prison on Friday jeering them on Monday morning because of the revolving door system in our prisons. That is demoralising for dedicated gardaí. We must ensure they know they have our support to police effectively. That is different from saying they should step over the line. However, a certain line must be set.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The Minister referred to accountability. When the Local Government Act was introduced a couple of years ago some of us advocated the establishment of local committees which would operate on a similar basis to the joint Oireachtas committees and to which the Garda and other public services would be accountable. The direct line would still be to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Public representatives with an electoral mandate who have local knowledge – we often get complaints from people – could make a valuable input at local level. That could be done in committees rather than in public as people might be afraid of the consequences of adverse publicity arising from loose comments which might be made. That type of approach could be invaluable in trying to achieve accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I was glad the Minister referred to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002. We look forward to its passage through the House in the near future and to its enactment. We hope it will address the issue of Garda powers. We must tackle the late night disturbances which are a cause of concern to the public. The Minister spoke about disabling and fatal injuries. That is unacceptable in a civilised society. I agree with Senator Terry about our drink culture. We should examine closing times not only of public houses but of takeaways. People often congregate outside such establishments and that leads to the problems we have all experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Consideration is being given to drug abuse prevention programmes, reducing the number of suppliers, the treatment of addicts and research. However, we could do more in that area. The Garda know the drug peddlers in our town, as I do. I am sure everyone here knows those involved in their areas. However, they still seem to be able to operate with impunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">It is important to have a judicial system which relies on evidence. It is also important that innocent people are not given custodial sentences. No one wants to see that happening. However, it is equally wrong that people who devastate other people's lives through criminal activities – drug peddlers are in that category – can walk the streets of our towns, go into our pubs and sell drugs without being arrested. If we can put terrorists in jail on the word of a superintendent, surely we can see what could be done to address the problem. Unfortunately, it took the murder of a journalist before the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is an international example of how to tackle crime in certain areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I understand there is a backlog of cases to be heard in the courts. It has been said that we need more judges and I am sure the Minister is examining that. A suggestion was made to me recently – I am sure the Minister knows better than I do the value of such suggestions – that consideration should be given to bringing rape cases back to the Circuit Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The consistency of decisions by judges at all levels should be examined. The separation of power is important, but that does not mean people are not accountable for the decisions they make which often impact on the public. Some judges will adhere to technicalities, while others will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Community service should be more widely used. I mentioned the revolving door system in prisons. We should also examine drug use in prisons. I understand that it probably brings a certain degree of order in prisons, but many people who went into prison clean have come out addicted to drugs. That is unacceptable. They tend to become educational institutes for crime. I have seen many hard people go to prison and come out as drug peddlers because they came into contact with people whose criminal operations were more sophisticated.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">We need a multi-faceted approach to this problem. It is not only the Legislature, the Judiciary and the enforcement agencies which must tackle this problem. Society in general has a responsibility to ensure a reduction in crime as befits a proper civilised society.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_162">I welcome the Minister to the House. We are fortunate in the State to have a man of his eminence and qualifications because it is unusual to have someone who is expertly qualified in law and also has a distinguished career in politics. It is good that we have someone of that background as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The Minister rather unwisely invited us to trawl a little bit widely among the <i>fleur du mal</i> of the criminal system. I will take up that invitation because I was also invited on the Order of Business by the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, to raise something I and Senator O'Toole raised yesterday. It is in the context of clerical child abuse. I invite the Minister urgently to consider a review of the equality legislation. When it went through the House certain exemptions were granted specific to the Roman Catholic Church to allow it to dismiss teachers on the basis of their lifestyle. People can be punished without any criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I, as a reasonably upstanding member of society and Member of the Oireachtas who was elected by the people to this Chamber and who does not have any criminal convictions, was a teacher. Had I been a teacher in a national school paid for by taxpayers' money but under the control of a clerical managerial system, I could have been thrown out for advocating homosexual law reform. That would have been legal, while at the same time these people were concealing and moving around people who were molesting children by the tens, if not the hundreds. That is an intolerable situation. We fought this issue with the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, a member of the Labour Party, and with other people. Now is the moment that this issue of gross injustice and unjustifiable discrimination should be addressed. I appeal to the Minister to do that. He will find the churches very reluctant to resort to the kind of stiff lobbying they used before. This is a very important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Senator Jim Walsh raised the question of corporal punishment. In a way, I understand his point because in the area in which I live children of seven years of age give one cheek. They know exactly what their rights are. They break into garages and, when challenged, threaten to get the Garda or have one up in court. The problem is one of balance. Nevertheless, I would hesitate to reintroduce corporal punishment. We have heard all about the clerical sexual abuse of children. I went to an upmarket Protestant boarding school where the most vicious and deviant physical attacks on children took place which ruined lives and drove a number of people I know into areas bordering on criminality. That issue has never been addressed. We need to be extremely careful when considering the introduction of such a measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I hope the Minister is successful in increasing the number of gardaí, a measure which would still not be sufficient. The new gardaí must be specialised. Community policing was the best thing that ever happened in the inner city of Dublin. We have had some excellent community gardaí. Let us have people who know the area, the people, the families and the streets. I am fortunate enough to have a little house in Cyprus, a country with practically no crime. The reason for this is that if anyone even steals something from a shop, the entire family becomes criminalised and community action comes into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I ask the Minister for information on the question of mobile telephone use in cars. This is an extraordinarily dangerous practice. I see many drivers, including drivers of heavy good vehicles, with one hand on the wheel and the other holding a telephone. Apparently, there is some kind of legal difficulty in prosecuting this behaviour. I ask that something be done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I understand from newspaper reports that the penalty points system will come into operation, but only in terms of speeding. This is laughable. The area in which it is really needed is drink driving, which, it seems, will be exempt, although the newspapers may be wrong. I ask the Minister for reassurance in this respect. The fact that it will apply to speeding is a nonsense because the whole policy is incoherent. In various parts of Dublin, one passes from what appears to be a motorway into another type of road, also apparently a motorway, on which the speed limit suddenly changes arbitrarily and one can be fined and receive penalty points for breaking it. My feeling is that this has been done to make money and apply points. It is unreasonable that one should not be given penalty points for being drunk out of one's skull and a danger to people when one receives them for breaking arbitrary speed limits. It is a stupid approach which needs to be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I could not agree more with the Minister's comments on drink related violence. For years I have been warning this House about the development of these enormous hangars in the centre of Dublin. In the old days a Dublin pub had something special about it. One went out, had one's pint or short in a pub and held a conversation. Now one cannot hear a damn word. The whole idea is to push as much drink as possible. The drink companies have no conscience. They are drug peddlers and we should investigate them. They are not even Irish any more. We used to have Uncle Arthur who had a social conscience. Our companies have been gobbled up by multinationals whose target is to increase sales year after year. In the past couple of years, consumption has increased by 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">What are the judges doing with regard to the planning laws? Why are they giving licences to pubs in my area, for example, where, despite machine gun attacks and murders, new lapdancing clubs are opening all the time? Who licenses these places? We all know perfectly well that many of them are run by the mafia.</p>

Let us look into who is granting licences these days. I have been in court when applications are rubber-stamped without a single question being asked about the suitability of the people running these places.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">While CCTV cameras are a wonderful idea, half the time they are not monitored, the film is scrubbed or they are pointed in the wrong direction. The idea is good, but the policy must be implemented properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">On the question of children's recreation, we must provide recreational services for them in the inner city. Where I live we have the wonderful Breaking the Cycle programme. It is heartbreaking, however, that when they reach a certain age, the children are kicked back onto the streets where they exposed to drugs. We must do something radical and this is the Minister who could do it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_175">I welcome the Minister. I, too, have many things for him to do. The previous Minister, a great enthusiast for prisons, initiated a very extensive prison building programme. We have now reached the top of the league in Europe in terms of many aspects of our penal system. For example, we have the highest throughput of prisoners in Europe, the highest recidivism rate – 89% – which is utterly astonishing, and the most expensive prison system. It costs more than €1,000 per week to keep a prisoner incarcerated here. We also have the highest proportion of under 21 year olds in custody. I am not enthusiastic about our position at the top of the league in all these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I was extremely concerned by the findings of a report commissioned in 1999 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Published in August 1999 under the title, A Survey of the Level of Learning Disability (Mental Handicap) among the Prison Population in Ireland, the study was carried out by Mr. Michael Murphy, Dr. Mark Harrold, Dr. Seán Carey and Mr. Mark Mulrooney. I strongly recommend the Minister read the report if has not yet had the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The survey covered 10% of the prison population. Psychologists visited all 14 prisons in the State. Alphabetical lists of the inmates were drawn up and each tenth prisoner on the lists was interviewed, unless he or she was considered by the governor or his representative to be unsuitable for the purpose. The vast majority of prisoners asked to co-operate with the study did so. During the one hour interview a number of assessments were made, including the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test which examines reading, writing and mathematical ability. To their horror, the researchers discovered that 28.8% of the prison population scored below 70% in the test, which denotes severe disability or mental handicap. The equivalent level in the general population is 2% to 3%. What was also extraordinarily worrying was that a comparison of the scores here with those of prison populations in other countries, for example, Australia and the United Kingdom, found that the scores of prisoners elsewhere were very similar to those in the respective general population. Ours, on the other hand, were ten times higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The study found significant differences between the group with this very low intelligence quotient indicating serious learning disabilities and other groups. The former had spent far fewer years at school and one of the most interesting facts to emerge – I ask Senator Walsh to take note – was its very high dropout rate in the first two years at secondary school. The average age at which the prisoners in question left school was 13.7 years, whereas among other prisoners it was 15.1 years. The researchers pointed out that this was the stage at which the number of remedial teachers in schools drops off severely. In their recommendations they argued that the most important way to keep people out of prison would be to increase the number of remedial teachers catering to pupils of that age, not reintroduce corporal punishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">They also pointed out that the vast majority of the prisoners in question had been unemployed – query unemployable – before they became involved in crime. Many of them did not have any skills and none had a profession. The prisoners examined ranged in age from 16 to 64 years, but it was a much younger group who had learning disabilities, the average age of whom was 26 years. The average age of other prisoners was 29 years. Among prisoners in the Curragh and Arbour Hill there was no significantly younger group with learning disabilities or a mental handicap because such prisoners are mainly imprisoned for sex offences and were found to be very much on a par with the general population.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Another extremely worrying finding was that only 28% of those with learning disabilities were involved in preparing for examinations, compared to 48% of the general prison population, although it is good to see that 45% of them were receiving some form of remedial education. I wish to share some of my time with Senator Quinn.</p>

One has to ask the value there is in putting the people under discussion in prison because doing so leads merely to their involvement with hardened criminals. Sadly, they are then led into further episodes of crime on release. They are simply being contained for a short time.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I thank Senators Norris and Henry for allowing me to contribute on this subject, even if only to make one point. The Minister has spoken very well today and covered the area he set out to cover. He spoke of a multi-faceted approach, but I want to focus on educational disadvantage, an aspect about which Senator Henry has just talked. If we allow to continue what has happened here in recent years, one section of society will be left out because of educational disadvantage. Disadvantaged persons have not shared in the growing prosperity we have seen and find that they have been left behind from the very beginning. I have had the opportunity to be involved in an aspect of education in recent years and learned that some people are at the back of the class from the very first years of schooling. They lose contact with the class, which is the root cause of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Minister has been very good today in speaking about the various ways in which he will tackle crime, but I am talking about getting to its root. We have to do something about educational disadvantage by investing money. For 20 years or more we have been tinkering with the edges of the problem, investing amounts of money which are tiny when compared to the task in hand. Our failure is exemplified by this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Even if we continue to pass many laws, build as many prisons and employ and empower as many gardaí as we like, we will not get to the root of the problem. We are approaching it like someone who copes with a flooded house by buying more buckets when what he or she should be doing is making repairs. While this is not the immediate responsibility of the Minister, it is for Cabinet to ensure that, among the challenges and financial difficulties we face, one of the issues it tackles is educational disadvantage. I say this, not just from the perspective of fairness and equity, though every citizen should receive an equal education, but also from the point of view of self-interest. It is in our interest to do this because if we manage to tackle the issue, we will have a much better chance of eradicating crime.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_186">I welcome the Minister and I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. I am delighted that the debate thus far has been so constructive and positive. Given the seriousness of the issue, we need to put all our heads together to tackle crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">It is a statistical fact that we have made significant progress since 1997 with a major decrease in the level of serious crime, though it is disappointing to hear the Minister say 2001 saw crime figures rise by 18%. That might be the result of an increase in funding with the amount included in the Garda Vote going from €472 million to €999 million in the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">A very important issue is the strength of the Garda which now stands at 11,700 and will, I hope, increase to 12,000 by the end of the year, as suggested. We have increased the number of gardaí by 900 since 1997 which has to be good because there is no better deterrent than the old one of the garda tramping the beat. When I last checked, the number of prison places had increased by 1,300 with a possible 700 more on the way. I hope this has put paid to the revolving door syndrome. During Deputy O'Donoghue's tenure as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the last five years, in excess of 45 Bills were enacted to serve in the war against crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I welcome the funding of €110 million allocated under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 for crime prevention and which is directed specifically at young offenders. The Minister's comments regarding the tragic murder in Coolock of young Alan Higgins, allegedly by a 15 year old, serve to remind us of the wisdom of that funding and the direction in which it is being spent. It is the belief of most Members of this House that public disorder and street violence by young male offenders is the most serious issue facing us. The problem is not unique to this country and the Minister alluded to the fact that the multi-faceted approach is the appropriate one, as all common sense analysis has proven during the years. We must involve our educationists and health and housing officials and consider, in particular, the design of housing estates. The housing estates that have cropped up in this city over the last 30 years have, in their own way, served to bring about a significant level of crime and caused the ghettoisation of certain communities, which has not helped. One does not want to pick out areas, but they are known and the statistics show that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The probation and welfare service is wonderful and at any given time may deal with as many as 5,000 offenders fulfilling community-based sanctions under its supervision. The service is also involved in the management of offenders and the development of programmes as an alternative to custodial sentences. This can be good, particularly when dealing with youngsters. The increase in funding for the service has been in the region of 116% since 1997 and staff numbers have risen from 46 to 268, which represents money well spent. We should continue to highlight this area. The number of Garda youth diversion projects which have also played their has gone from 12 to 65. This type of funding and focus which diverts money towards securing the well-being of young people and possible young offenders represents the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">There is a clear perception in the community that youngsters under 16 years of age are not treated in the same way as adults and that a form of softly, softly approach is taken to them. There is truth in this which manifests itself in the syndrome of joyriding with offenders knowing damn well that they can joyride until the cows come home and that, if they get caught, they will be out the following morning thumbing their noses at the law. That is not good. We need an overall crime policy directed at young people, against which no one would argue. There comes a time when the concerns of law abiding citizens equal, if not outweigh, those of the young offender of 14 or 15 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">If a judge remands a young offender and then finds there is no space for him or her to be detained in Oberstown or Trinity House, that can cloud the judge's focus in such a way that the young offender can walk away from a situation from which he or she otherwise would not. In that sense, there is little deterrent for young offenders because they know this is the situation and they probably know it better than some people working in the Four Courts. To his credit, the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set aside a portion of a prison to cater for young people convicted of serious crimes. I am not sure about the status of that provision, if it is still in existence or how it is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Since 1995 we have made progress on tackling crime, if one considers there were some 105,000 indictable crimes at that time. The position has improved. At that time the drug barons in this city were thumbing their noses at the law. They are now truly convinced of the commitment of this and the previous Government to rid this city of their activities, but that war continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Senator Terry mentioned the CCTV system, a welcome development, although it should not be considered a replacement for gardaí on patrol. It is an aid to them. I hope it alone will not be the only deterrent in place, although its existence is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The misuse of drugs and drink is probably the greatest threat to our society. We can all play a part, even young people presenting themselves in Garda cells, in tackling these problems. Early diagnosis can bring about early intervention. Such matters should occupy our thinking. We must provide whatever resources are necessary to strengthen the law on underage drinking, a point alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, was a good one, a provision of which is the age card system to detect young people under the age of 18 buying alcohol. It was encouraging to hear the Minister say that there are more than 70,000 age cards in existence. That shows that young people who wish to drink are observing the law. I know of a publican in this city against whom there are four claims for being overenthusiastic about this provision. He has been told he is discriminating against young people who do not have an age card, but he insists on the presentation of that card and good luck to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Parents, teachers, community leaders and all of us need to participate in the fight against crime. We cannot leave it to the gardaí to fight the cause of it. It is most important for people, particularly the elderly, to feel safe in their communities. Attacks on the elderly in isolated areas are the most despicable and cowardly acts any person can perpetrate. The fear and apprehension of the elderly and their families concerning such attacks are dreadful. The community alert scheme launched last year, or earlier this year, has been a good source of comfort to the elderly. I am not sure how effective it is or what has been the feedback on it, but I can only imagine that the putting in place of any regulation or system such as that must be positive. We must all play our part in this; it is not good enough to leave this fight to the gardaí. The concept of good neighbourliness must be put into practice. If we all go down the right road in this regard, we can hopefully rid ourselves of the level of crime in our society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I welcome the Minister to the Chamber. I am hopeful about the work he will do in this area, even though I am a member of the Opposition. I agree with him that there is a need for a multifaceted approach to tackling crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">One aspect of tackling crime which was also raised by Senator Walsh is the role local authorities can play in preventing it. It is important that local authorities are resourced to do their work. Cutbacks in local authority funding were announced recently, which is not a good direction to go if we are serious about tackling crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Anti-social behaviour, which can range from minor to major offences, is a serious problem in my area. If young people get involved in anti-social behaviour, the chances are they will become involved in more serious crime later on. I saw children as young as eight years of age set fire to public lighting in my area and one wonders what they might do when they get older. The extension of a community warden service throughout local authorities would be a good measure. Park rangers should also be in place in all our parks, which currently is not case as local authorities do not have the necessary funding to provide for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">More resources are required for estate management. I agree with Senator Kett's point on estate design. The gardaí set up an arrangement last year to provide for liaising with county councils on estate design, but the county council in my area does not appear to have taken that on board. It is important to provide resources for the putting in place of more CCTV cameras. If we adopt the approach of zero tolerance, we need to address the problem of minor crimes such as causing litter and vandalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It is important that local authorities are given the proper resources to provide facilities for young people and to tackle problems such as drug abuse, abandoned cars and so on. The education aspect is important in preventing crime. Anti-crime programmes dealing with joy-riding and other crimes should be in place in schools. We need to instil civic mindedness and a respect for the environment in young people. I recognise that type of work is carried out in schools, but the necessary back-up must be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">There is also the issue of equality in society. I agree with the comments about the importance of having a Garda presence. It is important to have gardaí on the streets, partly to make people feel secure about their local areas, but also to help the gardaí develop a relationship with members of their communities. It is bad for that relationship if gardaí only appear in a patrol car in the community when something has gone wrong. It is helpful if they are on the beat in the day time so that members of the public can talk to them. The community garda service is important. From talking to gardaí, I am aware they have many new responsibilities which are valid, but we should not let community policing take a back seat because it is important in terms of crime prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Gardaí need to be assisted in their work in terms of the types of cars provided, an issue to which many recent incidents draw attention. The equipment they have is not up to scratch. They need good modern equipment to protect them and others and to help them do their job to the best of their ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Providing support for people released from prison is another issue that needs to be addressed. This is related to the provision of housing and local authority funding. A constituent whose son is due to be released from prison told me recently that she is afraid to let him back into her house because he might endanger her tenancy with the county council. She is also worried that if she does not take him in, he will end up on the streets and become involved in crime again. While we need to provide more resourcing for the gardaí, garda accountability and efficiency are also important. I support Labour's proposal for an independent Garda authority and Garda ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I wish to raise a matter that is a little removed but relevant to this debate. The image on one of the No to Nice campaign's posters of a young man with a gun to his head is terrible. That image is on display in my area and it is a very bad one. I do not think that type of image would be allowed in advertising products and I do not see why it should be allowed in political campaigns. That needs to be looked at. I am fully supportive of freedom of speech but, if this continues, it will be a bad aspect of political campaigning.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_207">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McDowell, on his appointment and I am sure he will be an excellent reforming Minister. He has some exceptional public servants at his side who have contributed a great deal. Whatever may have been the case in the past, there is much progress and enlightenment to be found in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform today. Very good progress was made by his predecessor, but the benchmark of success will be the ability to describe cities and towns as safe. There are cities in Europe that are described as safe, but I am not sure we can say that about too many of our cities; there is clearly a distance to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Everyone is subject to the law. Without getting into the Minister's opening remarks on clerical sexual abuse I note, in an historical sense, that the State has now become distinctly Gallican as opposed to ultramontane. I have some reservations about some of the very strong points made by Senator Norris regarding equality legislation. The ethos of institutions is very important to minorities as well as majorities. I was present at meetings between the Taoiseach and representatives of four of the main churches. One does not want to see circumstances where a teacher is dismissed because of something in their private life, but neither does one want people in a school or an institution who are openly, consciously and deliberately undermining its ethos. I have some sympathy with Senator Walsh and Senator Norris regarding corporal punishment. I have no doubt that there are some downsides to it but the risk of physical abuse is so great that I would not be prepared to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I congratulate the Garda on the exceptional vigour and success with which it has managed to get on top of dissident paramilitary activity in recent years. That has been apparent since the Omagh bombing, but even before that I recall that it alerted the Government very early on about the formation of the Real IRA. I would not necessarily take the statement released at the weekend by Real IRA prisoners in Portlaoise prison at face value – one might want to examine some of their motives. In a way it is a declaration of political and ideological bankruptcy and that has more than a little to do with the successful pressure applied by the Garda. While it is very understandable that relatives are very upset about the terrible tragedy that befell them, it is not fair to be critical of the gardaí. They have prosecuted the issue with exceptional vigour and have been in no way soft. The first priority was to make sure that further attacks of that type did not happen. As far as I know there has only been one further victim of the Real IRA since the Omagh bombing.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Protection of the person is the most important thing. Like Senator Terry, a son of mine was attacked in an entirely unprovoked manner in Temple Bar – excessive drinking obviously had something to do with it. I would wish to see people highlighting and stressing the long-term health effects that excessive drinking will have on young people, many of whom will have terrible health problems in 20 years time. There is a case for variable rules at local level, subject to overall national limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Picking up on a point made by Senator Jim Walsh, we should look closely at the Patten report to see what might be applicable here. The idea of district policing partnerships, involving people from local authorities rather than having an over-centralised system, might have a great deal to recommend it. Law and order is not just about protecting the property and persons of the middle classes. In many ways law and order problems are worse in particular estates. There was a very strong demand in Clonmel for a form of community policing and for things like lighting to be fixed. There has been an ongoing problem there for ten or 20 years. Law abiding people who live on estates feel intimidated and their property can be vandalised. There is a major social justice task to be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am somewhat distressed by the pervasive drug culture that seems to exist in certain prisons. I feel that it should not be so and that it may be liberalism carried to excess. I strongly support everything Senator Henry said about promoting education and rehabilitation in prison and encouraging people to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The issue of rural Garda stations is one that will often come before the Minister. I can understand, as with rural post offices, that there may be a case for concentrating resources as some kind of rational efficiency. On the other hand, one must not underestimate the confidence factor in a village of having a resident member of the Garda who can liaise with the wider force as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Some gardaí got into trouble during a recent anti-globalisation protest and were seen as being too heavy-handed, but I do not want to discuss the merits of the particular case. I was in Gothenberg when its main street – perhaps due to the too softly-softly approach of the police – was absolutely wrecked. The Minister for Finance was holed up for several hours in his hotel as the mob rampaged. Unfortunately, there are people who want to provoke violence in such circumstances and, better still, provoke an over-reaction from the police. I have some sympathy for the Garda in respect of this matter and do not want Dublin to be wrecked in the future because of some kind of anti-globalisation demonstration. While I accept that people have the right to protest and march peacefully, they must realise that a certain balance has to be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I wish the Minister well during his period in office.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the Minister, whose contribution was most enlightening. He has been described by Members on the other side of the House as a reforming Minister, but we on this side will take our time and judge him on his actions. We wish him well in his work during the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">There is no doubt that the drink culture which has enveloped the country has contributed significantly to the rise in the number of public order offences. I am delighted that the Minister referred to the issue of public order and that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill will be introduced to deal with many of these offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The changes to late night opening hours introduced by the previous Government should be re-examined. It is when pubs and clubs close in the early hours that difficulties arise. Gardaí are in the dreadful position of trying to deal with the hooligans who, drunk out of their minds, leave pubs and clubs and go into chip shops and take aways. Any garda who has been on night duty will tell one that most of the trouble starts outside establishments of this nature. An argument erupts and is usually followed by the type of violent crime about which we too often read in the newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Mobile phone theft, to which a previous speaker referred, is extremely prevalent, particularly as it relates to schoolchildren who are being assaulted and having their mobile phones stolen, which is absolutely disgraceful. I understand that in Amsterdam and other places stolen mobile phones can be rendered inoperable. The Minister and the Garda should investigate the possibility of putting in place mechanisms here which would facilitate this. I believe the number of mobile phone thefts in Amsterdam has been significantly reduced as a result of the action taken there.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">A number of Members referred to violence in communities and that fact that such communities are being held to ransom by young thugs. Whether we like to hear it, this is a common occurrence throughout the country. Decent, law-abiding citizens are afraid to come out of their houses after 8 p.m. In the past one would not let a woman go out on her own late night, but able-bodied men are now afraid to walk the streets in many cities and towns. This is not the type of country in which we want to live. We must give the Garda proper resources to deal with these thugs and make the punishment fit the crime. I am not in favour of all these liberal ideas, I believe in making the punishment fit the crime at all times. I am delighted that the Minister stated detention will always be required for some of these thugs who have no respect for law and order, property or anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The additional gardaí we have been promised must be appointed. The Minister must take action in this regard. I take on face value his claim that he will deliver on the promises made.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The number of gardaí on duty in urban areas at night is another matter to which consideration must be given. It would be frightening if members of the public learned how many gardaí are on duty at night in cities such as Waterford because I was certainly shocked when I discovered the true position. One will not obtain information about this issue directly because one is informed that it is an operational matter. However, there are ways to find out and it is frightening that there are so few gardaí on duty when needed. I refer here to the time of the night when pubs, discos and clubs close their doors. It is then that we must have gardaí on duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Freeing up gardaí to do their duty is another matter which must be addressed. The Minister is aware that our courts are flooded with gardaí who people believe should be out on the streets. I accept that these gardaí may be obliged to give evidence in cases or whatever, but we must give consideration to how they might otherwise be deployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I will now hand over to Senator Ulick Burke.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_232">I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the openness he displayed with regard to the current problem of crime. He has stated one of his priorities is the creation of trust among the various people who deal with crime and that he perceives the necessity for change within the Garda and the manner in which the force is structured. His comments in that regard are welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I wish to highlight the inactivity of the Minister's predecessor, who promised a review of the Garda's rural policing programme. As Senator Mansergh stated, the majority of rural Garda stations are, other than for a period of one hour, closed each day. In the past communities at large welcomed, co-operated with and supported members of the Garda who lived within their communities and worked effectively to prevent crime. The trust they built up, however, has disappeared. I hope the Minister's undertaking to re-establish that trust will lead to the reopening, in a meaningful way, of all Garda stations in small towns and villages in rural areas because it is important for people to see the visible presence of a garda within their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">As previous speakers stated, it is not acceptable that Garda cars merely speed into areas and drive through them and that this is seen as good policing or effective crime prevention. Such patrols are almost always disrupted by virtue of the fact that a traffic accident may have occurred in another area and the Garda car is obliged to speed off to the scene.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Minister referred to increasing the number of gardaí, but his comments do not reflect reality. When one takes retirements, replacements and all other factors into consideration, the number of gardaí is actually decreasing. As a result, the Garda presence is scattered and totally ineffectual. It is easy for people to refer to the ineffectiveness of the Garda in terms of crime prevention, but unfair and wrong to make such comments because gardaí do the best they can in the prevailing circumstances. Statistics prove, however, that they are ineffective. It is a shameful indictment that many members of the public are unwilling to report crime to the Garda because they know their complaints will not be dealt with as they are viewed as being insignificant. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Minister referred to the flowers in the pot and offered a number of rosy pictures in his presentation, but what will be done about the long promised CCTV systems for the towns and cities? That is not happening. We are depending on the Garda for protection and any technology that may be used to provide protection for the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">It is an indictment of all public representatives that over the last five years we have succumbed to pressure from publicans to extend the licensing hours. It was done in order that we could modernise our arrangements in consultation with other European countries, but the reality is a history of intoxication, hardship for families and all that goes with it. If the Minister is to be reforming, I urge him to tackle immediately the issue of opening hours and the ready availability of drink for the young. He referred to identity cards. One could have a bag of cards, but they are useless if the doors are opened and there is free availability of drink. If the Minister can prevent this and other related problems, such as drink driving and drugs, he will be remembered for a long time.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_238">It is customary for a Minister to attempt to reply to most of the points raised. Although I kept careful note of the points to which I would like to reply, I would need an hour to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Senator Jim Walsh made a number of interesting points, one of which, which was echoed by other Senators, including Senators Mansergh and Terry, related to the interaction of the police force with local communities. One of the things I hope to do in the new legislation on the Garda Síochána is examine a formal statutory basis for local police partnerships of one kind or another. I want to consult deeply and widely on the issue, but I am aware from my colleagues in the Lower House that there has sometimes been considerable disquiet on the part of members of local authorities that their relationship with the police, which is sometimes good and sometimes not so good, is based on a relationship of inequality. It is not the function of the police to interact with local authority members. What I am tempted to do – it is subject to getting the sanction of the Government – is put in place something that would reflect the Patten report emphasis on local policing, local political involvement in policing and interaction between local government representatives and the police force. It is necessary to have the valuable, direct responsibility of the Garda Síochána to the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas, but something more in terms of accountability and interaction with elected public representatives is required. I am interested in examining this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">A number of Senators and Deputies have asked whether we should revisit the issue of the licensing hours. The growth in alcohol consumption in Ireland was significant for a long time at the end of which the change in the licensing hours only occurred. One cannot, therefore, attribute the growth in consumption of drink to the licensing hours. Nonetheless, I am sympathetic to the notion that there should be some role for local authorities in determining licensing hours in their areas. It may well be that there are areas of our larger cities which should have later hours than others and that in quieter parts of the country the community might prefer the active nightlife in their areas to come to a close at an earlier hour than in other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">It would not be such a terrible thing – I voice this on an entirely speculative basis but would be interested to get the reaction of Senators – if local authorities were to be given a significant role in deciding what the opening times for various types of premises in their areas should be. It is easy to think of a small rural town which wants to close early and does not want its youth hanging around its chip shops at three and four in the morning. It is equally arguable that a one size suits all approach does not suit and that there should be all night cafes in large cities or in the centres of large cities. In the gaming and lotteries business, the amusement arcades were left to the discretion of local authorities which had to decide if they wanted to be like Bundoran, Ballybunion or wherever. In addressing the question that is increasingly being raised as to whether we were wise to extend licensing hours, there might be scope for simply saying it is a matter for people to choose and facilitating a varied approach across the country determined by local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Senator Norris invited me, in the course of a wide ranging and passionate speech, to revisit the issue of equality and the position of denominational education under our equality legislation. He linked it to the sexual abuse scandal. I cannot follow whether there was a logical sequitur in his argument. He felt outraged that somebody such as himself, on account of his sexual orientation, could have been the subject of unfair treatment in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">If we believe in denominational education and the rights of people to run private educational institutions, we must accept that those institutions must have a right to maintain their ethos. While observing due equality for all in the teaching profession, we can sometimes query whether the religious ethos of one institution requires more significant treatment of employees at the recruitment stage than other schools. I am of the view that a Jewish school should be entitled to give preference to Jewish teachers, a Catholic school to Catholic teachers, a Protestant school to Protestant teachers and a non-denominational school, if it so wished, to people who are liberal free thinkers and do not fit into any category.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I am against the one size suits all approach or the notion that there should be a uniform rule which would apply in every case because diversity in education is valuable. I echo Senator Mansergh's comments on the point made by Senator Norris. It was not the Roman Catholic church or the churches in the Republic which sought this provision. When I was Attorney General I was struck by the fact that Northern denominations came to Dublin to argue that, at European level, their rights to denominational education should be preserved. Therefore, it is not simply a matter concerning the legislation of this State. Ireland insisted that EU equality directives should not encroach upon the rights of private denominational education to maintain their own cultural ethos.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Some Senators spoke about the increasing noisiness in so-called super pubs. I would simply say to Senator Norris, however, that as one gets older, one's hearing disimproves. I have found that to be so.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_247">On a serious note, I have been encouraged by the positive and understanding nature of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">We live in a society with a growing and increasingly urbanised population, yet policing resources are finite. For the time being also, our society has more people in the 15-25 age cohort where criminality is common, particularly among males. These are facts of life and, therefore, increasing demands are being made on our police force due to increasing levels of criminality. The contributory causes of crime have to be tackled, including unequal access to education and the design of housing estates. There is no simple solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">In the context of criminality and the alienation of young people, I am still passionately attached to Part 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act which is designed to prevent ghettoisation. It is aimed at ensuring that we no longer build vast suburbs with no proper social facilities because those destined to live in them are from the lowest end of the socio-economic scale. They are most in need of access to decent shopping, housing and recreational facilities, yet they have found themselves ghettoised in the most deprived areas. Whatever adjustments are made to that Act in future, it is a step in the right direction. If we live in a republic, everyone should be willing to live alongside people who are richer or poorer. Pressure from strong interest groups should not be allowed to cause such an enlightened social policy to unravel.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I thank Members for their courtesy and the careful thought they put into their contributions. Although I could not possibly revisit all the points that have been raised, I have listened carefully to the entire debate and I will take those matters into consideration. Moreover, I would welcome any suggestions that Members of the House may make in the context of the ongoing and never-ending debate on crime and its causes.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_257">Yes, I wish to share with Senator Ormonde.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate. When the Committee on Procedure and Privileges met it was chaired by the Cathaoirleach and there was cross-party support for reform of the Seanad. Many Senators have contributed ideas for reform which they wish to see implemented. <i>The Irish Times </i>has taken a great interest in the question of Seanad reform, as have some other newspapers. While there are many divergent voices, there is clearly a strong wish for a re-examination of reform of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">In preparing for this debate, I looked up all the reports on reform that have been produced over the years. For example, in 1936 a committee was formed to re-establish the Upper House which had been prorogued by the then President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera. The 1936 debate produced three minority reports and five major reservations, so full agreement was not achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">In 1959, a Seanad electoral law commission was established, which discussed the possibility of increasing the role of vocational groups. In 1967, a constitutional committee dealt with the Seanad and its various duties and, in 1996, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe produced a report on the composition of the Seanad. Earlier this year, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is now a Minister of State, produced a report as chairman of the commission on the Constitution. From 1936 to 2002, therefore, many worthy men and women contributed to major debates on Seanad reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I have always liked the Seanad Chamber, which is a lovely part of Leinster House, and I have always contributed enthusiastically to debates here. It has stood to me as the Lord must have known this was to be the outcome for me. In particular, as a Minister, I always liked to steer legislation through this House. The contributions to legislation here are remarkably well researched and broadly based. Many Ministers, including myself, accepted amendments to Bills in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">During the three or four weeks we have been in session, there has been general agreement that the House has worked satisfactorily. I am sure, however, that the work of the House will not always be so tranquil and that prima donnas, mostly males, will cause many storms in teacups.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There is a need to examine our work to see what can be done regarding reform of the House, which has been so eminently presided over by you, a Chathaoirligh, and your predecessors. I do not agree, however, with the dictum "If it's not broken, don't fix it", which is a wearisome argument. If that was the case, we would all be the same until our dying day. We need to look at ourselves and change. I want to see the Seanad Chamber as a potent force for dialogue, debate and change. At the end of our five years of work, I do not want to see everything remaining the same as it was when we began. While we will have good dialogue and debate, we must also bring about change.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">It is worth reading the documentation on constitutional and Seanad reform, which is available in the Oireachtas Library. I must leave them back because other people may be looking for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Since 1936 there has been a constant theme, that there is a need for change and a need for the Chamber to refashion and reshape itself, and still it has not happened. It is a general belief that what goes on here is worthy and I am fully in agreement with that but, as I said, we need to look sharply at ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">What we said at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as you will be aware, a Chathaoirligh, was that we would have the debate in the House, then we would meet again to see what we could do within our own remit and parameters as of now. We would come up with ideas from that, then seek outside observations – we have not come to the shape of that at all yet – and see where we would go with that. Interestingly, the Taoiseach asked me yesterday what had happened the debate on Seanad reform and he was keen to hear what would come out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">We should strike while the iron is hot. When we go about the reform, for instance, we should invite people give their observations to us in public. Academics, local representatives and vocational groups would tell us in public how they think this should be, in the same way as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and Deputy Lenihan, who is now Minister of State, conducted their constitutional reform debate. I could see public submissions to a reform committee as being extremely useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">If we are to take that road, which remains a decision for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges committee, we should have the help of a secretariat. The Clerk of the Seanad and her team work long hours. They are painstaking and punctilious, as are all the Members, but if we are to set this up on a quasi-professional basis, we would need to have some outside help. That remains to be seen. The Minister for Finance can close his purse firmly and say, "Away with you, that is all fanciful," but we hope he will not do so and might agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I have noted the views of Members. Of the educational people, Senator Ross took the Chair before you were appointed, a Chathaoirligh, and he said it should all change. He would say, "Be gone" to the Taoiseach's nominees and the vocational groups elected by the local authorities, but he never mentioned his own area, the University Panel. Then somebody else stood up and spoke just about the University Panel but not about how they got here, apart from the fact that it was an arduous route. It is clear that there are many vested interests all around the House, and I fully understand that. This will not be a simple theorem where the formula comes out QED and one size fits all. That cannot be, but there is a need.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I want to see a position where this House is regarded as satisfying, fulfilling and worthwhile. One of the Commission reports, perhaps the 1959 one, recommended the abolition of the Seanad, echoing an earlier report. However, all that is negative and we need to be positive about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">On a purely prosaic and practical note, I could not believe when I came here that electronic voting, which is in place in the Dáil, is not in place in the Seanad. Perhaps that will be raised at Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and perhaps that is where such matters should be raised. Why should we be second class citizens? Perhaps it is supposed that we are not able to work electronic voting, so we are not getting it but the Dáil is getting it. If so, that is a dumbed down approach to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I am really speaking about what we will be doing at Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is renewing the case again, getting our domestic house in order as to the limits of what we can do and then moving on to whatever outside expertise, public consultations, secretariat assistance, etc. we will need for our reform debate. Around the House there is general agreement on this matter. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to speak on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">In both the previous Seanad and the Seanad before that there were people of great experience such as Professor Joe Lee and Maurice Manning, who researched this question of Seanad reform and did quite a lot of homework on it. All the points I would make have been made already.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_276">That is why we are all here. We should keep contributing to this debate because when the Seanad was set up 60 years ago the concept was one of reflection, and it has not changed. Society has changed greatly, yet our system has not been adapted to cope with those changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">There are three areas at which we must look, one of which is the composition of the Seanad. The composition is made up of five panels to which the majority of Senators are elected, the University Panel and the nominees of the Taoiseach. The question is how that change should reflect today's thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I have no difficulty with the local government electoral body, which has elected me on many occasions and given me the mandate to come in here and to reflect their views, because there is no better body of people who know what they want. I do not want vested interests in here who will be furthering a particular issue and, therefore, accountable on that issue only.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I am as good as anybody on a particular issue. I am an educationist and I come from the Cultural and Educational Panel. I can represent those views, but I am also a person who can reflect the views of the whole of Ireland on a full range of issues – the environment, justice, traffic and so on. I will be as good as anybody and so will every other Member of this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Having listened to the debate here, there is no question that the system is a good one. The question is how to refine it to make it more aligned with present day thinking. The concept is still right.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I would not change the local government electoral college, which is made up of the councillors who put us here. There is no better professional body of people who know how to get representatives who will reflect the interests as they see it, and it has worked well. However, the debate must move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I do not have hang-ups on the question of whether the electoral college should be formed on a national basis or whether it should be regionalised. I am very open on such thinking and I want us to further that thinking to see where we could go from here. I will let that debate take its own course.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The role of the Seanad concerns me. Since I became a Member in 1992 I have seen some little changes, unbeknown to ourselves. I felt initially there was not much being done here. It was a laid back type of Seanad. However, between 1997 and 2002, I saw it as an invigorating Chamber, where we were initiating many Bills. I can remember the Local Government Bill, the Education Bill and the Fisheries Bill, to mention but a few, all of which were initiated in the Seanad. There was great debate, particularly on Committee Stage where we teased out many problems which perhaps would have been missed if the Bills had been initiated in the other Chamber. Without meaning any disrespect to the other Chamber, I think we provide more time to tease out Bills, particularly on Committee Stage. I would welcome the initiation of a greater amount of legislation in this Chamber and many opportunities to tease out Bills initiated in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We do not receive fair media recognition. I do not seek attention for myself, but if one were to ask members of the public what we do in the Seanad, they would probably reply that they do not know. We do good work here, but it is not reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Senators who want media attention try to raise a topical matter on the Order of Business in the hope that "Oireachtas Report" will pick it up. That is wrong. We are not receiving the media attention we deserve. Senators do fine work and make great contributions to debates on many of the issues of the day, but this is not reflected in the media. This is unfair to us, our electorate and society at large.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill which was debated in the Seanad last week. The Seanad can play an important role in this core area. We often hear of decisions and regulations coming from Europe, into which Seán Citizen has no input. We may discover that a directive has been implemented in relation to the quality of water, habitats and so on. We often hear about these directives by chance simply because there happens to be a heritage area in our locality. This is not good enough. We have a golden opportunity to use this Chamber to scrutinise legislation and monitor what is about to happen in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Seanad lacks back-up services. We should not be the poor relation of the Dáil. I am not comfortable being a poor relation to anyone. We should stand alone and let the two Houses complement each other. We have fine people in this Chamber. We have to travel throughout Ireland to get ourselves elected and must be extremely professional at our job in order to be elected to this House. It is much harder to get elected to the Seanad than to the Dáil, yet we continually look over our shoulders at the other House. This must not continue. Every Member of this House is capable of putting on a fine performance. Far from looking over our shoulders at the other House we should stand alone. We have a role to play in complementing the other House, but should not feel that we are the poor relation. That concept does not rest well with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">We have aired this topic and thrashed it out. I have discussed it on many occasions since I first came to the Seanad in 1992. We all have a role in making Seanad reform worthwhile. We have a golden opportunity to make the Seanad the watchdog of European legislation and become more involved in committees of the Houses. Given the democratic deficit in the institutions of the European Union, we should use this Chamber as a watchdog. Let us link with the public and let it know that fine work is being done here. Now that we have thrashed the matter out here let us have an open debate outside the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Perhaps we should refine our electoral system, but let us not get rid of our local government electoral college. Local authority members are a first class electorate. They have never failed to elect good people to the Seanad. We might, however, look at the system of nomination of candidates by nominating bodies. I do not have sufficient knowledge of this aspect of our electoral system, but would welcome an open discussion on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Within the next year I hope this debate will be taken from the floor of this House and continued in another forum. I feel like a broken record and do not think I could keep talking on points I have raised time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">There is room for improvement. Let us compliment this House by making it a worthwhile place. Let us judge it on what it is. It is a fine House and we should not undermine it by treating it as the poor relation of the other House.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. During the years the Seanad has become for some, particularly during the silly season, a target for controversy. One sees headlines in newspapars calling for its abolition. These calls usually come from Members of the other House. It is regrettable that we are used as a target for criticism, but the media are usually happy to take up this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Now that we are involved in meaningful reorganisation and reform it is important that no one should be given priority in making decisions in this regard. It is particularly important that no Member of the other House should be allowed such priority. I was pleased to hear the Leader of the House insisting that if we move forward with agreed procedures of reform, no interference in those proposals from the other House will be tolerated, provided they are meaningful and correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Yesterday an arrangement was made in the other House to give the Taoiseach a free day every Thursday. Senator Ormonde is correct in her observation that we all raise items on the Order of Business in order to gain media attention. However, the sad reality is that we seldom receive replies to them. The Leader of the House gives a courteous reply and promises to raise the matters with the relevant Ministers, but 99 times out of 100 that is the end of the matter. If the Taoiseach has been released from duties in the Dáil on Thursdays, we should propose that he gives a short period of his time on that day to come to this House. If the Government has a serious intention to reform the Seanad, it must agree to such a request and there can be no excuse for refusing.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">During the years Senators were always delighted to hear that the Taoiseach, whoever it might have been, was about to come into the Seanad. We are always delighted to hear that the Taoiseach has taken time to come to the Seanad. Now, because of the rules of the other House, the Taoiseach is to be released from parliamentary duties on a Thursday and should pay this House the courtesy of spending part of that time in the Seanad. It would raise the importance of the House in a very simple way if the Taoiseach were to respond to our various queries. It would be a simple matter to agree on how such a session of one or two hours on a Thursday could be incorporated into the activities of the House. This would be a welcome gesture by the Taoiseach to reform of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">There has been much criticism of the method by which we are elected, which is said to be undemocratic. I put the other side of it. There were suggestions that Members should be elected on the same day as the general election and that the Seanad was seen by some people as the place where young tigers were trained for future graduation to the other House while being seen by others, as in my own case, as a House for failed politicians. If we subscribe to that notion, we fail ourselves. We should vigorously use the Seanad for its proper purpose. If we allow it to become anything else in the eyes of Members of the other House, the media or the people, we do ourselves a disservice. We should not allow that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">On the question of direct elections, one can imagine driving through the countryside and urban areas where posters have been put up by the various election candidates from political parties and independents outlining their policies. If there were also posters for Seanad candidates in the same places, one can imagine the confusion it would create, as well as the problems caused to the environment. It is unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">We should investigate the matter and be open enough to engage with those who have greater experience than ourselves, such as professional people who may have suggestions about meaningful reform. We should bring them in and listen to them. If there are critical things that must be said about the present situation, they should be taken on the cheek to help bring in worthwhile reform. Many suggestions will also come internally from the staff in the Seanad. The professional staff here are second to none and they have valuable experience gained from looking, listening and regulating debate from one end of the year to the other. They have important suggestions to make with regard to reform and improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The biggest problem for Senators is that, despite asking questions and looking for information, we never get replies. The task is obviously seen as too great. A Minister comes to the House, presents his or her papers and suggestions and then goes. That is the end of it, other than with regard to legislation. We must have some sort of mechanism whereby Members can ask a question, whether written or oral, and get a reply. That facility, which is available in the Dáil, is worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">While we are supposedly not representing a constituency, our constituency is the country at large, as Senator Ormonde said. It does not have a boundary and is not part of a county or urban area, but is far wider. We have a responsibility to that constituency even though it is far wider than the Dáil constituency we are more familiar with. If we had the opportunity to ask a question and get a direct reply from a Minister, it would be an important step.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Last week, we had the advantage of having the President of the European Parliament in the House to deliver a speech on the important issue of the Nice treaty. That practice is something we should encourage and expand on. However, there is another side and this was brought to my attention by a person who voted "No". Between 35% and 40% of the turnout voted "No" in most constituencies. There was no balance in this House or opportunity for anybody to speak on the "No" side, although I recognise that one would want to be the Lord to identify the person best suited to speak on that side. However, a sizeable percentage of the electorate, not aligned to any pressure group, wanted to have its voice represented in that debate. Unfortunately, this House did not have the opportunity to enable that but from now on, if we have a voice on a particular issue, we should balance that by inviting people from the other side to present their views.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">We could start this process by dealing with items of national importance on the Order of Business. If we could get a reply to the issues raised there within a reasonable time, regardless of the content of that response, it would be of value.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I agree with the views expressed by the last two speakers. The Seanad needs to be topical and must react more quickly. We have not yet debated the report of the Flood tribunal. By the time we do so, most people will have forgotten it. The Dáil debated the matter immediately and the Seanad will be seen to be weeks behind. That does this House no service.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I agree with Senator Ulick Burke regarding the suggestion that Senators be allowed to put down a question for written or oral reply. That is why we are here. I realise that we will not have the same privileges as TDs but we should have some options for putting down questions and receiving answers. Senators need more powers to interrupt and question a Minister. That would make the House more relevant and more of a debating chamber. I realise that the Seanad has no power with regard to financial Bills and reform of that area should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Members spoke about the regional basis for Seanad elections. Seanad elections could be modelled on European constituencies. Members of certain panels could stand for election on a geographical basis. The university panels are most obviously in need of reform and they should be opened up to institutes of technology and other universities not currently recognised. The system is discriminatory and there is broad agreement in the House that there should be reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I also agree with Senator Ulick Burke that, as our Taoiseach is now modelling himself on the Queen of England and comes into Parliament very little—</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_312">This is a democracy and the Taoiseach is paid to answer questions. The Dáil and Seanad do not sit often and it is important that he should be in the Houses. In light of the reforms being brought forward, there is scope for the Taoiseach to come to the Seanad to answer questions. The frequency of that could be decided on by the committee, but it would give the Seanad a better profile and should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">It was commendable that the last Seanad initiated many Bills. That gave this House a lot of publicity and gave some power to Senators. It should be continued in this Seanad and we should aim to have 50% of all Bills initiated in the Seanad. There is probably a better level of debate in this House than in the Dáil, as I have seen in my time as a Senator. Party politics can take over in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I think I am correct in saying that Dr. Garrett Fitzgerald appointed a Senator as a Minister when he was Taoiseach. That could be looked at again and Senators could be appointed as Ministers or Ministers of State. It might make the House more relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The points I have made about relevancy can be applied to the lack of media coverage of this House. There is no point in debating the Flood tribunal report in four or five weeks' time as it will be old news by then. The child sex abuse scandal has captured the media spotlight. We need to be more topical. The Seanad could be used by Ministers to make major announcements. Rather than coming to the House to tell us how wonderful they are and how they are doing a better job than their predecessors, Ministers should make concrete announcements in this House, allowing Senators to spread the word to the people. The media would become more interested in such circumstances. I saw a journalist from the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> in the press gallery yesterday, but it reflects badly that I have not seen any other media personnel here since I became a Senator. I realise they may watch our debates from their offices, but would like to see more journalists report the activities of the Seanad, as it is a very important House.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">There is a great deal of misinformation about the Seanad. Speaking as the son of a former Senator, I have to admit that I have only started to learn about the workings of the House in recent times. We need to educate politicians and the public about the powers and functions of the Seanad, with which I have been impressed so far. It was a good idea to invite the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Cox, to the House to speak to us. We should ask other public figures from outside bodies to come here to express their views about their areas of knowledge. Such contributions would benefit all Senators, as none of us has all the answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The process of nomination of Senators by the Taoiseach should be reviewed. My father was nominated by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, in the 1980s. The fact that nominees are generally drawn from the political parties does not do the House any favours. Senator Maurice Hayes and the late former Senator Gordon Wilson are notable exceptions, as their nominations added greatly to the House. There is a danger that political parties will abuse the Taoiseach's privilege of nominating Members by not choosing people of the calibre and reputation of the men I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Senators should be given far more backup facilities than is the case at present. I inquired in the clerk's office yesterday about putting together a Private Members' Bill, but was informed that no backup was available. It is not fair that I should have to do it myself and that I should have to get my party to provide legal advice. We are in opposition and do not have the benefits of legal advice and a huge Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Senators also face difficulties in relation to secretarial facilities. I realise we do not have a constituency <i>per se</i>, but believe we should be given the option of having a home office, especially as we invariably spend only one and a half days in Dublin each week. As most Senators are not from Dublin, it would make more sense to make secretarial services available outside Dublin, to allow us to do more work, especially research, when we are at home. If we do not have these services, the quality of debate in the House will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I am delighted to be a Senator and hope I am given a long stint in this House. I look forward to bringing forward some Private Members' Bills and receiving the full co-operation of Government Senators when I do.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_321">I have been a Member of this House for over 20 years and have found in that time that Senators are often too defensive about Seanad Éireann. An examination of the campaign for social reform shows that many matters were first discussed in this House at times when they could not have been raised in the other House. The matters to which I refer include controversial topics like divorce and seemingly innocuous topics like the abolition of the status of illegitimacy. Such matters never appeared on the Dáil Order Paper. When the rest of society was moving on, the political process in the Dáil seemed to become stuck in a mid-1950s mood.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I recall a succession of Senators raising a succession of issues. In my early days as a Senator, considerable shock was felt by many when Senator Norris was first elected. It was a shock to elected Members of both Houses as Senator Norris was, not only a public advocate of homosexual law reform, but his personal sexual orientation was also a matter of public record. I do not doubt that the shock changed the thinking of both Houses. The presence of somebody of Senator Norris's considerable qualities was a huge step on the road to the loss many people's prejudices. The peculiarities of a second Chamber facilitated his election, just as it helped mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The Seanad is an anomaly which we do not need. Democracy functions perfectly well in countries like Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand that do not have a second House. Irish democracy is much richer as a result of having two Chambers, however. The fact that the Seanad has only 60 Members means that virtually everybody, from every political party, can have a major responsibility in the area of legislation if they so desire.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I pay tribute to the former Leader of the House, Deputy Cassidy, whom I often teased. During his time as Leader, one third of Government legislation was introduced in the Seanad. The only people who failed to notice this development were the gentlemen and ladies of the press, who continue to write about the Seanad as it used to be. When major or minor legislation is being introduced in the Seanad, the initial debate takes place in this House. In a properly functioning society, legislation which changes the way the State deals with society or groups of people is always important. There is no such thing as unimportant legislation. If legislation is introduced in this House, it deserves to be noticed, talked about and reported. The public will not know about it if it is not reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Some years ago I met a group of social workers in my constituency who were given the job of implementing a Children Act that had just been passed. They were referring to the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, to advise them in their work as they were not aware that it had been dramatically amended in the Seanad. Deputy Noel Treacy was the Minister responsible for the matter at the time. They assumed that the Bill as passed by the Dáil was the final version, as they believed the popular myth that the Seanad never changes anything. The social workers, who were implementing and enforcing legislation for a health board, were using the wrong legislation. I blame the lack of publicity of the Seanad's work for their error.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">There are many other things that the Seanad could do. We have to remember that there ought to be a tension between Parliament and Government in a properly functioning democracy. Reality dictates that a Government will try to build a parliamentary majority, but the theory is that there should be a tension between it and Parliament, as the Government is accountable to Parliament. It is probably constitutionally incorrect to imply that any Minister is accountable to the Seanad, but most Ministers accept a degree of scrutiny in this House and we would serve our purposes well if we extended and formalised that scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">There should be a form of question time on a regular basis. We could start by giving Members of the Seanad the right to ask written questions and secure the same service that Members of the Dáil receive, even if we do not reach the formal stage of oral questions because, in my experience, only a few are reached. It is an anomaly that if I want information about something from a Government Department by way of a parliamentary question, I must get a colleague in the Dáil to table it. It should be possible to do that without too many changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">There is now a ridiculous amount of duplication. If one third of legislation is introduced in this House, and dealt with conscientiously and thoroughly, why then when it goes to Dáil Éireann is it still treated as if it has just been introduced? There are procedures in both Houses that duplicate each other. If legislation goes through a thorough period of analysis in Dáil Éireann, there is no purpose in repeating it here, or simply taking the amendments our parties put down in the Dáil and re-introducing them. That is not a good way to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The manner in which select committees deal with legislation could be examined. There could be a joint committee system to deal with legislation, as well as other matters, so the time of either House would not be wasted repeating arguments that were thoroughly rehearsed in one House. It would also free up time in both Houses to deal with other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The fundamental problem in Irish society and politics is that we can never deal with things when the public is concerned about them. Some reasons for that are perfectly in order – matters may be <i>sub judice</i> or at a sensitive time – but there is a list of areas where parliamentary scrutiny is impossible.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">There is no point discussing an extension of the number of days the Seanad sits because most Members would not be keen to meet five days a week. We must, however, ensure that the time allocated is used as efficiently as possible and that we avoid the repetition that currently goes on. It could be argued that if a Bill passes Committee Stage in this House, the other House should deal with it on Report Stage, and <i>vice versa</i>. There would be less repetition but achievements such as that of Senator Ross on the opinion poll legislation would still be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I appeal to the Government to deal with the anomalous franchise for the six university Seanad seats. Some might ask if should they exist at all. There is nothing about our democracy that would be undermined by the abolition of the university seats, any more than there would be anything fundamental undermined by the abolition of the Seanad. We will not abolish the Seanad and, unless we provoke people beyond patience, no one will get around to abolishing the university seats. It is a great anomaly, however, that only two universities can elect people when the majority of graduates in any given year are from outside those two universities. I propose that a simple, geographically based set of constituencies, similar to those for the European elections, should be established and everyone who completes three years of a third level course, diploma or degree, should have a vote based on where they live. The only reason for excluding people who have two year certificates is that the numbers would not be feasible. Three years seems to be ideal, although I would not want the franchise only to exist for degree holders. This has become an irritant and is offensive to those who did not go through the two traditional universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Our amendment reflects our irritation at the decision taken to distinguish between the Labour Party and the Independents based on the new concept of collective seniority. It effectively amounted to age discrimination. While my colleagues on the Independent benches deserve many things, they are not sufficiently enfeebled by their age to need discrimination of the form permitted in the equal status legislation. It is permissible to discriminate on age grounds where elderly people require it, but the Independent Members do not seem to be lacking vigour to such an extent that they need it. It is, therefore, extraordinary that younger people are discriminated against in favour of older people and that we have a parliamentary group with more women which is discriminated against in favour of a group with less women. The legislation allows for positive discrimination on both grounds. As long as that anomaly continues, we in the Labour Party will continue to find ways to raise what we believe to be an injustice.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. The second interim report by Mr. Justice Flood into certain planning matters and payments to politicians has evoked widespread public and political reaction since it was published last month. Mr. Justice Flood cuts through the evidence he heard at the tribunal to produce clear and precise conclusions on the many varied issues he was asked to investigate by both Houses of the Oireachtas. While we should all be mindful of the fact that the tribunal is not a court of the land, the conclusions reached by Mr. Justice Flood concerning former Fianna Fáil Minister, Ray Burke, have been stark and uncompromising.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The tribunal found that Mr. Burke received "corrupt payments" from various individuals during his political career. The report paints a picture of a politician hopelessly compromised who was unable to perform his public duties as a result of receiving vast sums of money. Notwithstanding the potential that charges may follow the publication of the Flood report and the implicit right of Mr. Burke and others to defend their name in court, there is an obligation on the Government and all Members of the Oireachtas to now consider the decisions taken by Mr. Burke while he was a Minister. The excuse that all these decisions can be left to one side while the tribunals continue should not be countenanced by any politician. Where there is worry or doubt about decisions taken in the past by the former Minister, the Government should now investigate and, where wrongdoing is found, take appropriate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The comments made in the other House last week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, are a cause of concern. During his reply to a question about Mr. Burke's handling of the passports for investment scheme the Minister informed the House that, having studied the file, he found the 11 passports and naturalisations granted were "irregular and unusual". He went on to say serious questions concerning the role of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in the granting of the citizenships should also be posed. His words were shocking. If the original decision to grant these 11 naturalisations is suspect in the Minister's mind, he has a responsibility to initiate an inquiry into the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The Citizenship Act, 1956, gives the Minister the sole power to revoke citizenship. Having read the file and used precise language in the other House, this suspect decision of Mr. Burke must now be reopened to enable questions to be put to those involved in the case. The power to revoke citizenship rests, not with tribunals, but with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Failure on the part of the Minister to act at this stage and investigate the bizarre circumstances which surround the granting of citizenship would further undermine the respect people have in the concept of citizenship. If a wrong was committed, it is compounded every day because citizenship is still available to the 11 individuals involved. While the scheme was discontinued in 1998, a total of 44 persons were naturalised by Mr. Burke as Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Having regard to the information already contained in the initial report produced by Mr. Dermot Cole, it is clear that there are serious doubts that the applications were properly grounded. The direct involvement of Mr. Burke and Mr. Haughey in the Mahfouz affair shows that breaches of the citizenship procedures were tolerated to an extraordinary degree. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must now ask questions of all the parties which make up this affair. If there is nothing to hide, an inquiry will show this.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Last week the Minister informed us that his predecessor, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, commissioned an internal report in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter. She outlined her concern about the decision to the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in November 1994 and furnished a memorandum to him setting out her concerns. I presume the memorandum still exists and that the current Minister has read it. I call on him to publish it forthwith in order that all of us can determine its importance. The former Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has a responsibility to share with the public the information she gave to the Taoiseach about her doubts on the legitimacy of the passports and the suitability of Mr. Burke for high office. While the Minister informed the other House that all the files on the passports scheme were sent to the Moriarty tribunal, has the same information been sent to Mr. Justice Flood?</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Cole report highlights many unusual and unanswered questions. It seems to have been a simple analysis of the file without any questioning of the parties involved. It is my understanding that a key official at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a distinguished civil servant, Mr. Matthews, was not questioned about the affair. Given what we now know about Mr. Burke, it is time for a serious re-examination of the facts surrounding this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">While the procedures behind the scheme might best be described as loose, to use the Minister's words, the detail in the granting of these 11 passports was "irregular and unusual". How were the passports issued before naturalisation was granted? The original applications were defective on a number of grounds. It is interesting to note that to this day no one has managed to determine the identity or status of the person who witnessed the statutory declaration of the applications. None of the applicants claimed any association with Ireland nor had they spent time here. The statutory requirement that applicants must swear loyalty and fidelity to the State was ignored in this case, despite the fact that Article 9.2 of the Constitution provides that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are "political duties of all citizens". Promises that $100 million was to be made available for investment opportunities in this country were not realised. Why did Mr. Burke sign these naturalisation certificates at his home with such undue haste? Too many questions still remain to be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The Minister has a proven ability as far as legal matters are concerned. As Attorney General, he moved quickly to provide the Government with a report on the national stadium controversy. Under the 1956 Act he has the power to revoke citizenships which have been fraudulently obtained. He cannot delegate this power to the tribunals. He should act in this matter to allay public concern and help restore public confidence in politics and the democratic process.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_345">Before dealing with the case which is the subject matter of the Adjournment debate, I would like to bring to the attention of the Members of the House that the report of the review group on investment based naturalisation in Ireland was brought by me before Government in July 2002. I arranged for its publication on 4 August 2002 and a number of copies were placed in the Oireachtas Library at the time. In addition, I issued a press statement which was widely reported in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">As that report shows, a major flaw in the scheme was that it was not statute based. The operating rules governing it, in the form of a statement of intent, were essentially a set of administrative guidelines which were flexible and flexibly operated. The review group report also shows that this flexibility or looseness of process applied in many cases and was not confined to the case which is the subject of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I informed the other House in response to a parliamentary question on 17 October last that I had examined a particular file at the request of the Taoiseach. The file is currently with the Moriarty tribunal. All the passport for investment files in respect of persons naturalised under the scheme prior to 1997 were sought by the Moriarty tribunal. There was a copy of the file in my Department. However, I also retrieved the original from the tribunal to satisfy myself that the copy file was complete and that was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">My examination confirmed that the file discloses that 11 passports and naturalisations were granted in a manner which was, even by the lax standards that frequently characterised the operation of the scheme in question, irregular and unusual. It appears that the passports and naturalisations in question were effected in a manner which bypassed usual formalities and ignored failure by the applicants to comply with elementary documentary requirements. It also appears that the passports in question were prepared in advance of the completion of the applications for naturalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">As I pointed out in the other House, no departmental file is likely to carry any explicit evidence of gross impropriety or corruption by a member of Government. Nonetheless, in the light of what we now know from the proceedings and reports of intervening tribunals, serious questions concerning the role of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, would be raised in the minds of any fair person examining the file with the benefit of hindsight. I am not in a position to supply any explanation from the contents of the file I have examined for the then Taoiseach's apparent interest in having the case processed with unusual haste. These may be matters on which the Moriarty tribunal may be able to cast useful light.</p>

It is somewhat strange that I am now being asked to do something which, when much fresher and closer to the event, was manifestly not done by the Senator's party when it had the opportunity to do so. Why? No satisfactory explanation has been offered to me as to why nothing was done. If it is now so egregious and so manifestly requisite of me that I should conduct an inquiry of some sort, why was it not done by the Senator's party colleague when both were Members of Dáil Éireann and she had direct ministerial responsibility for the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_355">It is notable that no such inquiry was held at the time and the matter appears not to have been progressed. While I am not saying anything critical of one of my ministerial predecessors, Mrs. Nora Owen, I will not be judged by a different standard or have the innuendo made that I am failing in my duty when no criticism was made of the former Minister, whose name the Senator did not even mention.

          <p eId="para_358">If Senator Hayes's point is that a different view must be taken of the matter now because of what we know from the tribunals, it has some validity. However, he will remember that his colleagues in Dáil Éireann made the point that it should have been apparent in 1997, before the tribunals were established, that this was a reason not to appoint of Mr. Burke. He cannot have it every way. I am aware of a desire in the Fine Gael Party to put me in the position of either stating there is nothing wrong with the file or else choosing to criticise the Taoiseach. I will not fall into that elementary trap. The real question is why the Fine Gael Party, when in Government, did nothing to investigate this matter or bring it forward. The Senator must ask himself this question as he shares collective responsibility for it to a far greater extent than I do.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">The Senator proposes the establishment of an interdepartmental inquiry to investigate whether decisions to grant naturalisation in 11 cases were validly grounded. There is little point in following that course. I put it to him that the idea of me asking either Mr. Burke or Mr. Haughey to explain their role in this matter is naive and childish.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">I am making the point that the idea that I would receive a reply to a letter which would allow me to return to the House with an explanation is naive. In the first place, I have indicated to the Dáil previously that the former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, commissioned a report into this matter during her term of office. The investigation was carried out by a senior departmental official.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">I presume <i>The Irish Times</i> had the Cole report. The investigation was carried out by a senior departmental official. Although the former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, resigned from office before the report became available, it became available during the term of office of Mrs. Nora Owen.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As I have already stated, the relevant file in this case is with the Moriarty tribunal. I am satisfied that the copy of the report on file is the report. In these circumstances, nothing would be gained by establishing at this stage an interdepartmental group which would operate in tandem with the Moriarty tribunal. Any such interdepartmental group would most likely be responsible to one or more Ministers, whereas the Moriarty tribunal is mandated by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">As to whether the investment naturalisation system was <i>intra vires</i> the 1956 Act in principle or <i>intra vires</i> the Act as operated is a matter about which I have very serious misgivings. However, successive Ministers for Justice granted citizenship in accordance with it. The Senator will appreciate that, at this stage, one would need to have very strong legal grounds before proceeding to revoke some citizenships and not others. Naturalisations which were<i> intra vires</i> the Minister, though improper, cannot be revoked on that ground only. If they were <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister, it would be a different matter. An interdepartmental study would not cast light on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Seanad adjourned at 2.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 2002.</p>
