        <heading>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy. </heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I wish to express the sympathy of the House and of our party at the very sad death of the former Senator Andy O'Brien, who served for many years in this Chamber and whom the Cathaoirleach would have known very well.  His family is here today.  While for them it is a sad occasion, for us it is good to get to meet those he left behind.  His lovely grandchildren show the recurring theme of former Senator O'Brien's life.  He was an amazing person having been a county councillor for 44 years, which is an enormous span of service in public life.  He was chairman for two years and was a member of several bodies, including the General Council of County Councils, County Cavan Vocational Education Committee and Cavan Urban District Council.  He received a medal of honour from Dr. Eamon Dwyer, the then chairman of Cavan UDC, for his work beyond the call of duty for the people of Cavan.  He was a former member of the North Eastern Health Board and was a keen member of the Cavan drama festival.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">There were many sides to him.  He was a very rounded person, who served as president of the Ulster GAA Council, which is no mean feat to have achieved.  He chaired the Cavan tidy towns committee.  He won the Vodafone "passion for the world around us" award, which is given to those who are very integrated within the community.  He served in the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th Seanad for the period from 1969 to 1987.  He did not contest the Seanad election in 1987 and retired from public life in 1996.  While in this House he served as spokesman for issues such as education, social welfare and the Gaeltacht.  He is survived by his wife Mollie and seven children, Colm, Madeline, Niall, Brian, Myles, Fidelma and Malachy.  He is also survived by his two sisters Rose O'Toole and Cherry Carter.  I already mentioned his lovely grandchildren who are also here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">While we often say it in this Chamber, his life was exceptionally varied and rooted in many organisations, having spent 44 years in public life.  We can only imagine how many people's lives he touched in all his work in the county council, the VEC and his work as president of the Ulster GAA Council.  He touched so many lives for good and is an example to us all.  While his passing is extremely sad, we should also rejoice at his lifetime of service to the country.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_4">On behalf of my Fine Gael colleagues in the House, I wish to respond to the Leader's generous and warm tributes to our former colleague, Mr. Andy O'Brien.  He left the House in 1987 and was known to the Cathaoirleach, Senator Ross and perhaps a small number of other Members who served with him.  He was an institution in Cavan politics and in our party for the best part of 60 years.  During that time, he served as a distinguished member of Cavan County Council and Cavan Urban Council, and was a Member of this House for more than 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">He was the key party man for Fine Gael in Cavan and the epicentre of the party in that area.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe told me about a meeting at which Mr. O'Brien's task was to bring together the warring tribes of Cavan and Monaghan in advance of their amalgamation into a new constituency.  Aware of the enmity that existed between the people of those two great counties, his first words to the gathered Fine Gael activists were that while he knew they hated each other, he asked them to work together for the next three weeks.  He always showed that common sense which others in politics may only rarely possess.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It was a great privilege to be with the O'Brien family at his funeral last week, which was attended by many colleagues and others from Cavan and throughout the country.  It was lovely to see the great affection in which this great man was held by his family and community.  He was, first and foremost, a teacher.  When he studied at the De La Salle college in Waterford, it was a hotbed of INTO activism, and he was an INTO politician in the first instance.  He studied there alongside Senator Kitt's father, Michéal Kitt; Jackie Brosnan, a distinguished INTO activist and former Senator; Henry Kenny, father of the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny; and Mr. Seán Brosnan, a distinguished Fianna Fáil Deputy for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">He was principal of the local national school in Crubany for more than 40 years, during which time he was awarded the highest honour for academic achievement, the Carlisle and Blake award for teaching.  This was a tremendous achievement and a great accolade for his standard of teaching.  I had the privilege of meeting him in Crubany in recent years.  His was an open house, to which any students who needed help with their studies could go.  People from the area went there regularly to pay homage to the great man and to seek his advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">As a committed GAA man, the Cathaoirleach is aware that Mr. O'Brien was a distinguished member of the Ulster Council for half a century, a fact that is recorded locally and nationally.  I am sometimes asked how this man from Cavan could possibly secure votes in Cork, Kerry, Limerick and other distant places.  There is no doubt his deep GAA connections helped him to navigate a successful Seanad election.  The Cathaoirleach would know of this.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_10">It is amazing how influence within the GAA equates to influence in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">My party takes great pride in the service of former Senator O'Brien.  For many years, he was the person who kept Fine Gael together.  He reorganised the party in the late 1930s and 1940s, worked for Tom Fitzpatrick in the local constituency, and helped deliver two seats for the party in 1969 and 1973.  He loved the Fine Gael Party.  His decision to enter politics came from his generous nationalism.  He was opposed to political parties taking upon themselves the task of flying the national flag, believing this to be a great disservice to the flag.  His generous nationalism gave him the ability to reach out to people not only in Cavan but throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">On behalf of my colleagues in this House and the Fine Gael Party nationally, I express our deepest sympathy to his wife Mollie and to Colm, Niall, Brian, Myles, Malachy, Fidelma, Madeline and his extended family.  Madeline, through her membership of Cavan County Council, continues the great O'Brien tradition of serving the public.  Andy will be greatly missed not only in Cavan but in our party nationally.  We salute his memory today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_13">My Independent colleagues and I wish to be associated with the words of the Leader and Senator Brian Hayes.  I understand Senator Ross served alongside Mr. O'Brien in the House for a short time.  I knew him through his involvement in other areas, particularly his close connection with the INTO.  His involvement in that organisation began when he studied at the De La Salle teacher training college in Waterford alongside one of my illustrious predecessors, former general secretary of INTO and former Senator, Jackie Brosnan.  Before shaking the chalk dust from his hair, he was the quintessential village school master, in the broadest sense of that description.  That his involvement went way beyond the duties of his classroom is well recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">At the recent meeting of the national management committee of the GAA, his great contribution to that organisation was remembered.  As a genuine public representative, he was committed both to national politics and local community development.  This commitment was evident in his work to cultivate Gaeilge both as a teacher and beyond, his work for the GAA in developing cultural activities in his area, and his efforts to develop drama, which depends so much on people like him.  He has the distinction of receiving the Carlisle and Blake award, an extraordinary honour that was given to only one or two teachers per year.  I hope his family still have the commemorative medallion, which is an important piece of memorabilia.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">He began as a class teacher, became a school principal and went on to become a national politician whose involvement in his locality represented all that was good and culturally sound in Irish life.  This is something that is well worth remembering.  His family can take great pride in his achievements and bask in the reflected glory of his contribution to public life at both local and national level.  We offer our condolences to them.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_16">On behalf of my Labour Party colleagues, I extend my condolences to his family on the sad loss of Mr. Andy O'Brien.  I add my voice to the tributes paid to him by Senators O'Rourke, Brian Hayes and O'Toole.  I did not know Mr. O'Brien but I understand my colleague, Senator Ryan, who cannot be here today, shared this august space with him.  I wish to pay tribute to a long life that was well lived in the service of the people of his county and the country as a whole.  It is notable that Andy O'Brien's lifetime spanned that of modern Ireland.   He was born in 1915, before the Easter Rising, and lived into the new century.  He was one of the generation which built this State in the spirit, as Senator Brian Hayes said, of generous Nationalism.  It was not in a strictly party political sense but in a sense of knowing as a teacher, public representative, a member of the Cavan drama festival and other State agencies.  That generous Nationalism is the kind of contribution that has made us the State we are now.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">On behalf of the Labour Party I thank the O'Brien family for Andy's contribution to the life of the House, his county and the country.  He lived a full life and enjoyed himself greatly.  From what others have said, he was a great man to be around.  Given that he was a teacher, he had a generosity of spirit.  It is clear from the presence of his family members in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery that he was greatly loved.  He was also greatly loved in his community and this House.  While his passing is sad, especially at this time of year, his memory will continue and he has left a great contribution not only for his family and county but for this nation.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I am delighted on behalf of the Progressive Democrats to join the other groups in paying tribute to Andy O'Brien and to extend our sympathy to his wife, extended family and his Fine Gael colleagues.  His many achievements have been well documented by previous speakers.  The thread that links these remarkable achievements was a life of unparalleled service to his community, county, province and State.  It is obvious that his contribution at national level was rooted in his community and county.  There is a message there for many of us in that it is important to keep those links close and reflect them when we serve the people.  I was taken by his involvement in the drama festival in Cavan.  I think it was Disraeli who said that all politics was acting.  Perhaps there is a link between the Cavan drama festival and Andy O'Brien's political life.  He deserves all the tributes paid to him.  Go ndéine Dia trócaire ar a anam.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancisOBrien" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I join in the tributes paid to the late Andy O'Brien who I knew for the past 30 years.  I always enjoyed his company when I met him at different conferences, football matches and other events in Cavan.  His passing is a great loss.  He enjoyed a long life.  His wife and family will miss him most.  He was a wonderful support to the Fine Gael Party.  There is no question he was a Cavan man first and last which the Cathaoirleach knows only too well through GAA circles.  As a Monaghan man, I knew it too.  Many a good story was told by Andy about the rivalry between Cavan and Monaghan, both in politics and the GAA.  He enjoyed being a member of the vocational education committee, Cavan County Council for 44 years and the Seanad for 18 years.  His was a wonderful life and he was a wonderful man.  To his family, on my behalf and that of Fianna Fáil, I extend our deepest sympathy.  May he rest in peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I join other speakers in paying tribute to the late, great Andrew J. O'Brien, a man I regarded as a friend.  Senator Brian Hayes said that the O'Brien's house in Crubany was an open house where many people went to pay homage to the great man and his wife, a great woman, and to get advice.  I was one who made that trip on many occasions to get advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Andy O'Brien was known for many stories but there is one I wish to recount.  It contains undiplomatic language and I hope the Cathaoirleach will allow me some latitude.  Andy O'Brien's son-in-law, Terry Argue, a well-known insurance broker and auctioneer in Cavan, told me a story of when he was president of the insurance brokers' association.  He invited Andy to address a gathering of the association in Cavan.  Andy started off his speech by his characteristic clearing of his throat.  He then looked down at the assembled group and said, "Individually, you are all, I am sure, fine gentlemen.  Collectively, you are a shower of bastards."</p>

          <p eId="para_22">He then proceeded to entertain the gathering for 45 minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Andy O'Brien was an elected public representative for more than 44 years.  He was a public representative until the day he died.  He was an honest, hard-working and funny man.  He was a founder member of the Cavan drama festival, former president of the Ulster council of the GAA and, until his death, president of County Cavan GAA.  He was affectionately known to everyone as "The Master".  He was principal of Crubany national school for more than 40 years.  He was highly regarded by the Cavan community and further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">When we paid tribute to the late Tom Fitzpatrick, I pointed out that we Cavan people do not like the Monaghan people and they hate us.  Andy was very familiar with that too.  I had the honour of proposing him for the Vodafone "passion for the world around us" award.  The photograph of him receiving the award, which I will treasure for ever, is on my sitting room wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">To his family, Colm, Niall, Fidelma, Malachy, Brian, Myles, Madeline, and his wife, Mollie, I express my deepest sympathy.  I know Mollie will continue the tradition of the open house in Crubany.  I extend my sympathies to the Fine Gael Party.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Ba mhaith liom focal pearsanta a rá.  Bheadh Andy O'Brien molta dá mbeinn im' thost.  Bhíomar le chéile ar Chomhairle Uladh beagnach 60 bliain ó shin.  Bhí ard-mheas agam air mar fhear macánta.  Fear ann féin ab ea é.  Dhein sé a chion féin ar son na gcluichí, ar son an Chabháin agus ar son na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Speaking after Senators Wilson and O'Brien, I hope Members do not see this as an attempt at an Ulster <i>coup d’état</i>.  I sat with Andy O’Brien almost 60 years ago as a member of the Ulster Council of the GAA.  He came from Cavan, which had won almost 40 Ulster championships, while I was from a county of football nobodies at the time.  He was most kind to me and showed me the ropes.  You, a Chathaoirligh, know better than anybody how convoluted the ropes of GAA politics are.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">He was a many sided man.  The great thing about him was that when GAA matters got boring he would talk about drama or teaching.  He was a great man and great company.  He made a great contribution to Irish life and he should be a role model.  He remained firmly earthed in the soil of Cavan and never lost touch with his roots.  He was as highly thought of in County Down as in County Cavan.  I extend my sympathy and respect for him to his family.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">As Leas-Chathaoirleach, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy for the late Andy O'Brien.  I first got to know Andy O'Brien in 1981 when he was on one of his trips for the Seanad.  I could never decide whether he was a politician or a GAA representative but I presume he fulfilled both roles equally well, as you, a Chathaoirligh, have done on many occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I remember Andy O'Brien fondly.  He had two distinctive attributes.  One was his distinctive cough, which was mentioned by Senator Wilson.  One could hear him before one would see or meet him.  His other attribute was that he wrote beautiful letters.  In all the years I received correspondence from him, I never received a typed letter.  His letters were always hand written in beautiful writing and good English.  As Leas-Chathaoirleach, I extend my sympathy to his wife Mollie and his family, most of whom are here today.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Andy O'Brien.  He was a Member of this House from 1969 to 1987.  He had the unusual distinction of being elected to Seanad Éireann on three different panels, which is a record that is unlikely to be equalled.  He was elected on the agricultural, administrative and labour panels.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">His political career has been well enunciated in the tributes but it was through his work in the GAA that I knew him best.  He was a former president of the Ulster Council and served on the Ulster Council.  At the time of his death he was president of the Cavan county GAA board.  He was an avid fan of Cavan football and one of his proudest moments was probably when Cavan won the All-Ireland in 1947 in Gaelic Park, New York.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Aside from politics, he had many varied interests.  He had a love of all things Irish, particularly history and culture.  He regularly mourned the demise of Irish rural customs and traditions.  He was an excellent conversationalist, witty and entertaining.  He was never happier than when sitting with a group and telling political anecdotes and jokes.  I had the honour of serving with the late Senator O'Brien in this House.  He was a thorough gentleman.  Of course, we had the GAA in common when talking.  He was highly respected, most humorous and had a wide circle of friends across the political spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I extend my sympathy to his wife Mollie and his sons and daughters, especially Madeline who is continuing the political tradition of the O'Brien family in the Fine Gael Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">With regard to raising matters on the Adjournment, it is important to point out that the onus is on Senators to be present in the Seanad on the Adjournment to raise the matters they wish to raise.  There have been occasions, especially last night, when Senators did not turn up when their matters were selected for discussion.

          <p eId="para_46">Last week I raised the question of No. 23 on the Order Paper, the motion in the Leader's name, but effectively in all our names, on the issue of Mr. Brian Curtin.  I do not understand why the motion remains on the Order Paper.  If the Government can tell the House that this is because it has not yet concluded its dealings with the former judge in terms of accepting medical evidence he has given, that is fine.  However we need to resolve this issue before the close of session on Friday.  It would be wrong if this matter remained on the Order Paper in perpetuity when the committee has done its work and the matter is resolved.  If it is a matter of negotiation between the Government and the former judge we should be informed of it.  The motion in the Leader's name is in all our names because we agreed unanimously to establish this.  I would appreciate some clarity on this by Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Yesterday the Government decided to appoint Deputy Haughey Minister of State at the Department of Education and Children.  I congratulate Deputy Haughey on his elevation.  He is a decent person and is respected on all sides of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I would like to be associated with the congratulations to a former Member of this House who has been elevated to Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I wish him well in his work.  He was an active Member of the Seanad when he was here with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">There has been much discussion on the issue of management companies that run housing estates or apartment blocks.  Difficulties have arisen from them and they have been discussed on radio and television programmes and in this House.  We have examined what has happened in other countries where these management companies are established as corporate bodies with legal recognition.  They have an input into the planning processes in the area.  For example, a person who wants to change the exterior of his or her house or make significant changes to the appearance of the area must get the permission of the local management group or syndicate.  It is established by law.  It would be useful if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government came to the House to debate this.  Everybody would agree that it is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">People are becoming the creatures of management companies over which they often have no control.  This should be put on a legal footing and a statutory basis so that people could have trust and confidence in them.  They could then deliver protection for local people as well as the facilities they need such as painting the exterior of the apartment block or looking after the landscaping.  Although it is not major work, it is important to quality of life.  Senator Morrissey and others raised it here and we should ask the Minister to attend the House and see if he can advance it.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate early in the new year about policy on the delivery of care for the elderly, particularly in light of last Monday's announcement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Against the background of creeping privatisation of elder care services, in line with the Minister's ideology, comes the introduction of a fundamental shift in basic health care delivery policy.  If one is old and in need of long-term care, one has to put up one's house while one's family has to care for one beyond that.  That is a fundamental change in how we deliver health policy and treats elderly people differently from the rest of the population.  I detect a strong opposition to this policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">On more than one occasion I have called attention to the fact that the establishment of the HSE has taken power and accountability over health policy out of the hands of elected representatives in the Oireachtas.  We need to discuss this fundamental issue.  The HSE has been established under legislation and we are a democracy.  This House needs to debate how the HSE is working and the issue of democratic accountability for decision making.  I have a major concern on the issue of elder care.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The recent budget did nothing to alleviate the high cost of child care to the many thousands of couples around the country who pay more on child care than on their mortgages and who expected the Government to meet their needs more than it is doing.  That is only one of the child care issues that needs to be examined.  What is the position regarding the proposed referendum on children's rights?  Can we have an opportunity to discuss the fine report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection instead of concentrating on one issue of that report?  There is much in it that Members of the House could valuably examine and debate in this public forum.  I ask the Leader to arrange those two debates as soon as possible in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I support Senator O' Meara's call for a debate on this matter.  It is regrettable that we discussed the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill last week.  If we were to discuss it this week we would have the opportunity to assess the impact of this latest measure announced on Monday.  One of the main provisions in that Bill was that 5% of the value of a property was to be taken into account in the definition of the amount of subvention.  Since 5% of €100,000 is approximately €5,000, or €100 per week, and the maximum limit in my area was €192, subtracting €100 from that maximum leaves €92.  I would like to ask the Minister what is to happen to that 5% stipulation under the new arrangement whereby the maximum amount would be at least €300.  Questions must be asked and genuine concern exists whether they would be better off signing over the estate while they are alive to protect themselves in future.  Many elderly people are terrified at what is happening.  The Minister should define the scheme.</p>

I urge the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue a directive to county councils to the effect that a councillor should not be involved in rezoning the area he represents.

          <p eId="para_74">I agree with some colleagues on this side of the House that elderly people are terrified.  They are terrified because of the lies told by the newspapers and the disgraceful language employed in attacking a decent woman who is doing her best and has provided an interesting idea.  This House should tell the truth on what is involved.  I deplore the fact that old people are being unnecessarily frightened.  When I am gone, I will not be living in the house.  Let them sell it, or do whatever they like with it.  I have no objection to paying my share for being cared for and it is odd that people object to this.  The Minister for Health and Children seeks to protect people's interest in the property while they are alive.  They have no quantifiable interest in it when they are dead.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I seek a debate on No. 17, which asks the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to provide an update on the Abbey Theatre.  Yesterday a small premises of no architectural distinction but of some historical interest was welcomed as a site.  It is behind the Carlton site on O'Connell Street where the Abbey Theatre should be.  It is an outrageous proposal at the instigation of a billionaire businessman that the Abbey Theatre should be located at an unsuitable site on George's Dock, taking over the principal water feature.  As everybody knows, it is not the best site.  The Minister wanted the Abbey Theatre to be on O'Connell Street.  It is outrageous that a small group of property developers and speculators can sit on the asset, leaving a scar on our main street and refuse to allow it to be developed in the national interest.  The Taoiseach should use his well-reputed negotiating skills to resolve this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">I agree with Senator O'Toole on the management companies of apartment complexes.  I have raised this scandal in the House previously.  A developer holds one flat so that he or she can control the situation on a legal technicality.  The tenants are not allowed the democratic right to elect a committee, the developer appoints his cronies to clean and maintain the property and services are not provided.  I passed a dossier on this matter to a friend and colleague who is now an auctioneer.  In his new profession he will take up this matter with great vigour.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The Leader should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inquire of the Israeli authorities the fate of Mordechai Vanunu, who was imprisoned for telling the truth about the Israeli nuclear facility.

          <p eId="para_78">I support proposals for a debate on elderly care.  The Tánaiste's proposal is a good one and I have no objection to it.  Senator Finucane has referred to one of the side effects of such measures, where people are pressurised to make wills and get rid of property.  Where there is a will, there are relatives.  Society is changing, people are living longer and family structures are different.  We must face up to these changes but we should not confuse a concern for the elderly, whom I support, with a concern for the heirs.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on local government funding?  The recent budget allocated less than 2% of funding to local government, creating a serious situation for local authorities.  It is an essential element of a democratic state and the means by which important services are provided.  Local government delivers public sewerage schemes, water, lighting and footpaths.  Stealth taxes will be forced on local authorities because of the under-funding of local government, which received less than 2% of funding compared with 8% for the rest of the public service.  Serious problems will arise as the estimates and budgets are compiled over the coming months.  The water service in Longford is in difficulty.  People do not have an adequate supply because the reservoir is out of date.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I seek a debate early in the new year to discuss the impact of global warming and changing weather conditions on rivers, waterways and flood relief measures.  We have seen the impact of a dry summer together with a very wet autumn, with much rainfall in recent weeks.  This has been wreaking havoc on many communities around the country, particularly in the lower Shannon and south-east Clare area, where the manner in which the ESB generating station controls water on the River Shannon is having a significant impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I visited a number of houses last night which had been flooded, with the residents cut off from their families and livestock, living in treacherous conditions.  There does not appear to be a plan or an initiative to tackle the problem, and we require a debate as early as possible.  If we were to believe the meteorological experts, this could be the future of our summers and winters, with much more rainfall in a number of weeks and months.  We should have an early debate on the strategy of various Departments, such as the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the OPW to alleviate the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">A debate would be appropriate and timely on the Minister for Health and Children's recent policy suggestion regarding elderly care.  We have often stated in this House, when discussing mortgage companies offering equity release, that a person's home is a castle.  As a country we were able to sustain free second-level and third-level education, and care for the elderly should be based on a caring philosophy rather than harsh economics, as is clear from the recent pronouncements.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Looking at it in this light, we should be ashamed of ourselves in that we want to stake a claim in the estates of older people who had to be cared for by the State in an era when the country has plenty of money.

          <p eId="para_100">The Donegal Bar Association, which represents a majority of solicitors in Donegal, has highlighted a significant backlog of cases in the Donegal District Court and the Circuit Court for the northern area.  Many of these cases would relate to family law, such as separation and divorce cases.  There are examples of a three-year waiting list.  This call comes with a backdrop of the population of Donegal being 140,000, with the Circuit Court dealing with a population of 300,000.  There are also case loads from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">It is a novel scenario for members of the Bar Association to make a public plea for additional resources.  The plea is specifically for the appointment of a second District Court judge to Donegal and a second Circuit Court judge to the northern area.  It is a serious issue as many of these cases are being struck out.  Some weeks ago a very eminent judge made a very strong statement in saying County Donegal was a forgotten county in terms of resources.  This is very serious for the law and instilling a proper belief system in it.  Ultimately, justice delayed is justice denied.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">The Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have very recently announced the intention to introduce a new financial watchdog for local authorities and I gather there will be legislation setting up special audit committees to advise on spending plans, estimates and everything relating to finance and accounts.  It will report directly to councillors at monthly meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The current system is problematic for all councillors and there is a significant burden on them, which will probably increase.  The estimates system is very complex and I am glad the Minister will meet the councillors' representative bodies.  I hope he will have appropriate commensurate measures for the proper financial reward of councillors, who will shoulder a great extra burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">We are aware of the current burdens, which include not only salaries and expenses, but proper pension provisions and severance packages.  We properly paid tribute this morning to a great gentleman of Irish local authority life, who served for 44 years.  People like that are being left behind with such provisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I join in congratulating the new Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  Will the Leader ask him to urgently consider the scandal in the National Educational Psychological Scheme?  The Leader might be interested to note that in her own constituency and that of Senator Bannon, Longford-Roscommon, there is 0% coverage in secondary schools, which is incredible.  In the primary school sector, Carlow has only 26% coverage and Kilkenny has only 21%.  There is a very significant variation.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">That has a major effect on children as they could be waiting two or three years for an assessment.  Primary schooling lasts for only eight years, with secondary schooling lasting five years.  There is no excuse for the significant variation in coverage around the country and I hope the Leader will pass on the concern to the Minister of State for his consideration.  I agree with speakers seeking a debate on the issue of nursing home charges.  It causes a great deal of concern, particularly the percentage rule.  If a house is worth €300,000, the owners could be liable for €45,000 in charges afterwards.  If it is worth €600,000, the owners could pay out €90,000.  We must clarify why it is a percentage and not a fixed charge.  It will cause problems despite what Senator Norris may think.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Last week in advance of Monday's announcement, I stated it was time private health insurance companies offered to the consumer the option of taking out an extra premium towards nursing home charges.  The number of those aged over 85 years will treble during the next 30 years which will cause a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The difficulty is that none of us knows at what age we will die, whether we will be in a nursing home and, if so, for how long.  The Minister for Health and Children should have approached this from a different angle.  She should have encouraged private insurance companies to create a scheme——</p>

Many people depend on the subvention and are on the maximum rent supplement.  While it is outside our control, we should note and debate it as it could become a difficulty.

I will obtain a satisfactory explanation which is what the Senator seeks.  Senator Hayes also congratulated the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey.  Most people in this House do so.  Senator Hayes also spoke about Mr. Dermot Nesbitt.  I knew him from when we began cross-Border initiatives and always found him open, fresh, frank and interested.  I was surprised to hear on the BBC this morning that he will not go forward for the next assembly elections in March.  He will be sorely missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Senator O'Toole seeks a debate on management companies which would be useful.  People are taken in when they attend residents meetings where a proposal is made which they think it is a good idea as the grass will be cut and windows painted in the complex.  However, charges increase and the work is not done.  We will endeavour to bring a Minister or Minister of State from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Senator O'Meara seeks a debate on policy for care for the elderly.  The Minister for Health and Children will come to the House, I hope during the first few days when we return, when we will fully debate the matter.  I know Senator Dardis replied to Senator O'Meara but I also wish to do so.  The situation since 1993 is that as one lies ill one's house can be sold over one's head.  I always thought it an extremely sad situation.  Older people might wish to return home and that prop of comfort is taken away from them.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, will do away with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Senator O'Meara is a person of probity and did not deliberately promulgate untruths about a policy.  We must debate it and work out its intricacies.  This policy is designed to ensure older people's houses will not be sold over their heads when they are alive.  Why should anyone object to the value of a portion of the house, the amount of which will be debated, being used after the person has received the care and passed away?  It is extraordinary to pretend——</p>

Nobody wants to talk about the 59 other worthwhile provisions.  Senator Dardis replied to Senator O'Meara as leader of his party in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator Finucane also seeks a debate on nursing homes policy which we will have in the early new year.  He also made the interesting point that local councillors who are also auctioneers should not be involved in rezoning decisions because unknown to themselves they may make decisions to their benefit.  This is a fair point.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Senator Glynn seeks a debate on the Appleby report which was brought to his attention and that of Senator Henry and other members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The report is from London and deals with mental health.  We asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to come to the House and he is most willing to do so when we return in the new year.  I will need a copy of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Senator Norris is glad interesting ideas on health care for the elderly are being discussed.  He has no objection to paying his share should it be necessary after he passes away.  We hope that will not be for a long time.  He wants an update on the motion on the Abbey Theatre which is on the Order Paper.  He also raised the issue of Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli whistleblower on the nuclear facility in Israel, and applauded him.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Senator Maurice Hayes is also concerned for the elderly.  His up-to-date knowledge and opinion on Dermot Nesbitt was extremely good.  I wish to point out to Senator Bannon that local government received an increase of 7.5% or 8%.  I note his concern but funding of local government is generous.  Senator Dooley is concerned about global warming, particularly flooding of the Shannon.  It started again in Athlone where the roads which normally do not flood until February or March are already flooded.  It is the old story of ESB management of the Shannon.  It would be useful to have a debate on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Senator McCarthy congratulated the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey.  He wants a debate on care for the elderly.  Senator Mansergh also wants a debate on this matter.  The call for debate on care for the elderly is overwhelming.  Senator Mansergh also applauds Deputy Haughey.  He also shared his knowledge of Dermot Nesbitt.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Senator McHugh raised the issue of the backlog of court cases in County Donegal, which is generally of three years' duration.  That is a matter for the Courts Service but it would be useful to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  Senator Quinn raised the issue of the flu.  It was brought to my attention by Senator Dardis that when the newspapers write about the need to get the flu vaccine, people do so.  However, it is not being written about at present and the take up of the flu vaccine is low.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Senator Lydon called for a debate on the Middle East and congratulated Deputy Haughey.  On the day the former Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, was in the House all sides of the House paid extraordinarily generous tributes to her.  We will combine the tributes to both Deputies and I thank the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Senator Coghlan raised the issue of future legislation on the financial watchdog for local authorities.  I do not know about it as we did not receive prior notice of it.  I will endeavour to find out about it. The Senator also spoke about how local councillors should have decent pension provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Senator Browne spoke about DeputyHaughey's appointment as Minister of State and the non-operation of the NEPS scheme in several areas.  He also called for a debate on nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Senator Hanafin raised the issue of subventions on private rented accommodation.  All sorts of issues are related to this because, sadly, many people renting out private property do not want to be on the list because they are then accountable for tax.  This is leading to anomalies.  We will endeavour to have a debate here on this issue at local government level.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and his staff and advisers from the Department to the House.  When I discussed this Bill last week, we had an opportunity to consider it over the weekend.  I read a very interesting article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by an eminent journalist named Colum Kenny, in which he put forward a very fair and balanced view in respect of this Bill.  However, one of the lowest forms of publicity was seen yesterday in an article about the former Tánaiste in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>, which ran the headline: “Mary the Blood Sucker”.  Deputy Harney is an excellent Minister and a former leader of a political party.  </p>
          <p eId="para_139">I no longer believe that self-regulation is enough.  I have changed my view since last week because of this article.  I wish to name the editor of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>, Gerard Colleran.  The paper is partly owned by Independent Newspapers.  I believe a front page apology should be given to this House.  Deputy Harney is one of our colleagues and at a meeting last night of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, she was given an ovation when she entered the room.  The article in yesterday’s edition of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i> was condemned by the largest party in the country, which felt insulted by it.  I call on Gerard Colleran to withdraw the article and issue an apology on the front page of the newspaper as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">It is so offensive that I find it hard to express the words.  How offensive must it be to Deputy Harney's husband, Brian Geoghegan, and both the Harney and Geoghegan families.  I will not say more, except to say that as a result of yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>, I now believe the Cabinet should reconsider whether we have a self-regulating press council or whether we need an independent press council.  Before the article appeared, I believed the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was very fair and went very far to try to come to terms with the newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Another point in respect of the Defamation Bill is whether an apology from newspapers is enough.  Again, there is a question mark over self-regulation.  Damages serve a punitive use.  The Bill provides that an apology can be printed after a libellous article or as a get-out clause.  I must commend RTE and TV3.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">We are served very well with our television service and national broadcasting because we pay €150 per year in a licence fee to ensure we have balanced and fair coverage of all political parties and news items.  However, they would never publish an article like that published by the <i>Irish Daily Star</i> yesterday.  That newspaper sells for €1.30.  Its readers should boycott it because of this article until the newspaper issue an apology.  I would find it very difficult to buy this newspaper as a result of yesterday’s article.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In respect of the Bill itself, the Minister of State may have an opportunity to look at this situation.  The <i>Irish Daily Star</i> is partly owned by Independent Newspapers, which is the largest newspaper group in Ireland and probably one of the strongest such groups in the world.  By association, the editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, its staff and the proprietors also come in for questioning in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Bearing in mind that one of the most of the scandalous publications concerned the late Liam Lawlor, I have made the point — it is provided for in the Bill — that a family can continue a defamation action even when a person is deceased.  I was preparing a Bill called the defamation of the dead Bill.  The Minister should seriously consider strengthening the section in the Bill dealing with the defamation of the dead.  The Minister did not pursue it further.  Such a provision is found in some jurisdictions, such as certain states in the US, including New Hampshire.  Australia is also considering such a Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">There is nothing more valuable than one's good name.  The graveyard is the greater equaliser and leveller of all.  After a person, including anyone in public life, has died, anything can be said about them.  Neither they nor their families can defend themselves.  The proposed press council should be strengthened so that, at least, it will take up a case on behalf of a deceased person and if the family has proof, it can go to the press council and press ombudsman and have its case processed and published.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I pay tribute to the Lawlor family, including Mrs. Hazel Lawlor, who went through a very sad time because of the libellous statement published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have spent much time over the last week looking at both the proposals for a press ombudsman and press council of Ireland brought forward by the media.  I have also read very carefully this Bill and the Privacy Bill 2006.  I am completely opposed to some measures in the Privacy Bill.  They are not right and go too far.  I will not support the Privacy Bill as it stands because there are significant problems with it, which we need to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">However, today we are debating the Defamation Bill.  Senator Leyden made a significant point when he spoke about the article in yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>.  I agree completely with Senator Leyden.  I thought the article was appalling.  It brings us all into disrepute.  The question is how we react to it.  I read the article yesterday and examined how it could be dealt with under what has been proposed.  The code of practice for newspapers and periodicals provides that newspapers shall at all times strive for fairness and honesty.  I do not think any fair-minded person would consider what we saw yesterday to be fair.  Under the privacy principle, the code of practice provides that readers are entitled to have news and comment presented with respect for the privacy and the sensibilities of the individuals.  I make this point to perhaps argue against Senator Leyden.  I agree with his response to the article, about which I felt embarrassed and saddened.  It was completely over the top and unacceptable, but the real issue is how one deals with it.  Can it be dealt with under the Defamation Bill and the proposals for the press ombudsman and the press council?  It can be dealt with in this way.  Some changes may be required and I will comment on those later.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I find the concept of a press council attractive because on each occasion the House has discussed defamation, libel and the press, Members always make the same point, namely, that people cannot seek remedies, redress or corrections without having recourse to the courts.  Only those who can risk or who are in a position to raise large amounts of money can afford to go before the courts.  Until now, therefore, the only way people could seek any kind of independent arbitration or redress was by taking that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The advantage of the proposal contained in the Schedules to the Bill is the fact that we will be in a position to establish a press council.  This will mean that an ordinary person who has been defamed, badly treated, libelled or whatever by the press will be able to approach the press ombudsman, who will be independent, and he or she will be able to use his or her resources to investigate the complaint, reach certain conclusions and seek redress on behalf of the individual concerned at no cost.  That is a major and important advance.  The next avenue — still at no cost — open to the complainant will be that if he or she is not satisfied with the findings and conclusions reached by the ombudsman, he or she may appeal to the press council, which will also deal with the matter.  For the first time, therefore, we will give ordinary people the right and the opportunity to have a matter corrected or to seek redress in a fair manner and at no financial cost.  That is a major advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Most people who read something about themselves in the newspaper about which they are dissatisfied become concerned about their character, their reputation and what their neighbours and other members of their communities will think and they will want the information corrected.  If an honest mistake has been made, it should be easy to correct.  However, publishers state that they are often afraid to correct something because by doing so, they admit liability and stand open to court action as a result.  That kind of nonsense creates difficulties and it is dealt with, to some extent, in the Bill.  It is important that consideration be given to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I listened to Senator Norris's contribution and I know from where he is coming in respect of this matter.  I have known the Senator well for 20 years and on more than one occasion he has been unfairly and badly treated by the media.  I could place on record a number of examples in that regard.  I have encountered similar difficulties with the media and, in preparing for this debate, I examined the way different newspapers dealt with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I had a serious argument with <i>The Irish Times</i> which, in my opinion, libelled me.  I did not receive satisfaction but I was given the right to reply.  I chose not to take the latter because it was not what I was seeking.  The newspaper and its editor engaged with me on the issue and we argued the point.  In the end, it was my decision whether I wanted to take the legal route.  I do not know whether I will ever do so but I am not attracted to doing so.  However, I would be attracted to taking the avenue offered by the establishment of a press council.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">In respect of the next point I wish to make, I must declare an interest in that I am vice-chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Independent Newspapers did a three-page hatchet job on the latter that was unfactual and wrong.  We were able to prove, line by line, that the supposed facts contained in the article were incorrect and that it defamed and damaged the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The difference between that and the experience I had with <i>The Irish Times</i> is that Independent Newspapers — it is very difficult for me to have sympathy for it in this regard — refuses to engage with the board.  This is an example of how badly the press does its business.  Is it any wonder it does not receive much sympathy?</p>
          <p eId="para_157">What can we do to change the position?  We can pass the Bill and move matters forward.  However, there are a number of difficulties with the legislation.  For example, I do not understand the concept of partial privilege.  I may not be present in the Chamber — I will listen on the monitor or read the transcript of the debate — but I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform comment on what I am about to say in his reply.  What will be the position if a person has dealings with the press ombudsman and the press council, remains dissatisfied and then decides to take legal action?  Will he or she be in a position to take such action?  I am seeking to ensure that no existing right will be restricted or confined by the potential establishment of a press council or press ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Section 16(3) contains a ten-line sentence.  I am suspicious of such sentences and am of the view that it is wrong to use them.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has nothing better to do, perhaps he will read section 16(3) while I am commenting on it.  We are presented with one long sentence, comprising a combination of sub-clauses, etc. and in my view it could be written in a more easily accessible way.  The final part of the subsection states "[I]t is proved that the defendant was requested by the plaintiff to publish in the same medium of communication in which he or she published the statement concerned, a reasonable statement by way of explanation or a contradiction, and has refused or failed to do so or has done so in a manner that is not adequate or reasonable having regard to all the circumstances."  Even in terms of punctuation, the use of a comma before the word "and" is somewhat daft.  I do not know what purpose such a comma serves and I am quite nifty at syntax.  I read the sentence in question on seven or eight occasions to try to gain some understanding as to what it means.  It should be written in a way that Members and others can understand.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_162">I take it that the phrase, "and has refused or failed to do so or has done so in a manner that is not adequate or reasonable having regard to all the circumstances", means that partial privilege is allowed in certain circumstances but that if a publisher refuses to implement what has been asked of it by the press council or press ombudsman, partial privilege will no longer be extended and that the complainant will be able to have recourse to the courts.  I am interested in discovering the connection between the press council's deliberations and findings and the restrictions that will be introduced on foot of the long sentence to which I refer.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will indicate how a person may have access to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The greatest difficulty with the press council will be the lack of sanctions.  I accept that, under the Constitution and the law, it might be very difficult to fine people.  However, I would like the power to issue fines to be granted.  I will table an amendment in this regard.  Just as a public house can be closed for a period if its owners do not comply with the law in the context of selling alcohol to under age people or not complying with the smoking ban, I am of the view that a publication should be closed down for a number of issues or days if it transgresses.  This would give the press council teeth.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">It should be part of every editor's contract to comply with a code of ethics and with what is required of him or her under the legislation and by the press council and the press ombudsman.  Editors should be required to do as they are bid by the press council or the press ombudsman.  I expect to table a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  I apologise to the Acting Chairman for exceeding my time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.  The concept behind the Bill has been in gestation for some time.  The Minister said that the National Newspapers of Ireland commissioned a draft defamation Bill in 1994.  Few believed the Minister last year when he committed himself to being open-minded about the draft legislation.  Having read parts of the Bill I can say that he has delivered on his word.  The Bill may not have progressed much since 1994 simply because those proposing it might have been afraid of the outcome and what they had they held.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Defamation is a serious issue which needs to be addressed now.  In drawing up the legislation the Minister must maintain a balance between freedom of speech and the right of an individual to his or her good name and reputation.  Balancing those two rights can be tricky but at the same time the Minister must recognise that freedom of expression is fundamental to the workings of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Some journalists and commentators on this issue made off-the-wall claims that they should have an absolute right to write what they wish and that should take precedence over all other considerations.  Those comments lie where they are because under no circumstances could that be the case.  For example, the front page of the <i>Irish Daily Star</i> yesterday was outrageous.  To malign someone who has given her life to politics in that way shows the newspaper up for what it is.  That was not the first time the editor of that newspaper had been in the limelight for publishing such content.  We have come to expect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Democratic society is entitled to a press for high standards and good ethics.  When those two values are in place it is incumbent on the press to hold people like us to account if we are to be accountable to the public.  That is the case in most democratic societies.  The media, however, has no system of regulation.  The only recourse available to someone who has a legitimate claim against the press is a right of reply.  While the defamation may be on page one, the reply will probably be on the back page. Litigation is the only other option.  There are few who can take on the power of the media.  A balance is needed to give someone who is defamed redress without having to take that expensive route.  The Bill seeks to achieve that and will deliver when the dust has settled.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I am not sold on the provision to appoint an ombudsman and an independent press council because the council is to include 13 members, seven of whom will be independent public figures, a further five will be drawn from the representatives of newspaper and magazine publishers while one member will be drawn from the National Union of Journalists and one of the independent members is to be chairperson.  It will be the overall decision-making body in a new procedure to enable members of the public to lodge complaints about press behaviour.  If six of the 13 members are all of the one ilk it would be difficult to achieve independence.  Will there be a quorum for the meetings and will it simply make a stipulation regarding a number of people?  If, for example, seven or eight is a quorum, if six of those who turn up religiously are the media gurus and they are like-minded, independence goes out the window.  It may be that the quorummust comprise members of each group among the 13.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Bill introduces a new defence of "fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public importance".  That is a fair and reasonable point because it makes it harder for the individual to sue without good reason and protects the media.  There will no longer be an admission of liability and if in court a newspaper apologises or lodges a sum of money that should not be seen as an admission of liability.  Although we have not heard from the press it should be fairly happy with the Bill because it may have feared that the Government would appoint itself arbitrator.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Many people's reputations have been destroyed by outrageous reporting.  The most annoying aspect of that is that even if an apology is submitted the following morning the damage is done.  Mud sticks.  Heretofore most media organisations preferred to fight a claim in court than admit they are wrong.  Defamatory comment, even when it was wrong, sullied one's reputation and the only means of retribution was an expensive one.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">We must be sure, however, not to stifle good investigative journalism of which we have seen many examples, including "Prime Time Investigates" last Monday night.  A good story needs no embellishment.  Headlines rarely bear any relation to the story below them and sensible stories may have outrageous headings.  It is the nature of the business that headlines sell newspapers.  Accordingly, newspapers with any degree of integrity should print headlines that match the content of stories.  Unfortunately, democratic politics and an active newspaper industry need each other in equal measure.  I hope the Bill can in some way assist members of the public to achieve a situation whereby nobody can be defamed or have their character taken without having access to reasonable redress.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.  I regret that this important Bill has taken an undue amount of time to come before the House.  That said, I welcome it.  For all the reasons outlined by previous speakers, the Bill is urgently required.  We need it now more than ever.  More and more newspapers, especially British ones, are coming to this country carrying scurrilous articles.  I refer in particular to the article about one of our senior politicians, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  That type of journalism is unacceptable.  It is disgraceful and a shame on the newspaper that carried it.  We have seen other articles in the past that also leave much to be desired.  I hope the measures contained in the Bill will help to improve the standards of journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">We are dependent on good investigative journalism and we have been well served by the media.  There was a time when one could take anything one read in a newspaper as being factual.  I still like to think what I read in a newspaper is true, but we know the ethical standards of some journalists are not as high as they should be.  From time to time, certain newspaper articles have caused great hurt and upset and defamed people's character.  This proposed legislation, which is overdue, should help to update our laws on defamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The press needs freedom to report accurately what is known to be true, but freedom of the press brings responsibilities, and we want to see these upheld.  We want professionalism and high ethical standards in the press.  There is a thin line between reporting factually and sensationalising a story.  The Bill sets down the rules by which journalists must operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I welcome many aspects of the Bill, especially the setting up of a press ombudsman and an independent press council.  The press ombudsman will provide the public with a forum for complaints about published articles and allow people to seek redress without having to resort to the courts.  Heretofore, the majority of people could not afford to take on the press, no matter how strongly they felt their good name had been damaged.  I welcome the fact that there will be more independent members on the press council than members of the journalistic profession.  It is important that we strike the right balance.  That, in itself, will help make it easier for people to seek redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I thank him for attending the debate.  I regret that the families of deceased persons cannot seek to uphold the good name of deceased relatives, although if a case had been initiated before death, it can proceed.  However, in some cases, the first time anything is written about certain individuals is following their death.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the reason he has omitted to provide redress for the families of deceased individuals whose good name has been called into question.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public importance must be coming from the press.  The version of the new defence in the Bill is much narrower than that outlined in the report of the legal advisory group on defamation, which has claimed this is to be regretted.  The stronger we can make the rules, the better reporting we will get and the more protection that will be afforded to individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I welcome the Bill's provisions in the area of damages.  Currently, libel damages appear to be a lottery.  This was evident in the recent O'Brien case.  I had better not say any more about that case as it may be appealed.  It is difficult to understand the level of award given in that case compared to other cases where greater damage may have been done but where smaller awards were given.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate how that will change in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I welcome the fact that the Bill requires the courts to address the jury on damages, where they are to be awarded.  The party is also allowed to address the jury on the question of damages.  In addition, an apology may be published without any admission of liability.  I welcome this provision which will allow people to seek redress by way of an apology.  Heretofore, some journalists appear to have found it easy to take a person's good name causing great hurt or damage to an individual or his or her family and, subsequently, to publish an apology in very small print and hidden within the newspaper some days or weeks later.  I have always felt sympathy for the individuals concerned because while everybody reads the front page, very few people might see the correction or apology located elsewhere in small print.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I welcome many aspects of the Bill and hope it will be enacted as quickly as possible.  It will deal only with articles published after the Bill is enacted and will not be retrospective, which is regrettable.  However, that cannot be avoided.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_182">I welcome and compliment the Minister who always finds time to come to the House and listen to how we view legislation that is about to be enacted.  This is an opportunity for me to discuss the Bill and compliment the Minister on updating and reforming the law on defamation.  In his contribution he said he consulted widely going back to the 1990s and set up the legal advisory group to facilitate more discussion, especially the impact of the legislation on the public.  That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">However, I have the read the Bill and thought about it.  I have changed my mind on it very often during the past week.  We all want a democracy, freedom of speech and journalists who will investigate a story and present it in a fair and reasonable manner as outlined in the Bill.  I have no difficulty with that.  The problem is how best to measure what is being told and printed and how it is interpreted by the man in the street.  The Bill is an attempt to level the playing pitch between those who write articles and those who read them.  I am not sure if we are getting it right in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I will never forget reading about the late Liam Lawlor's death.  I was shocked by the headlines and the details and I have yet to see an apology.  Maybe there was an apology but, if so, I did not see it.  As he is dead the family has no redress.  That is not fair to a family who have been so tragically destroyed by such articles.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Yesterday, while discussing this Bill, I saw on the front page of the <i>Irish Daily Star,</i> this gutter newspaper, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, depicted as, “Mary the Blood Sucker”.  What will this legislation be about?  If that story was printed after the enactment of the Bill what would be its impact?  Would there be enough power to deal with that gutter press?  It led me to ponder on the mindset of the journalist who wrote it and his background.  Would he have done it if it had been his mother, sister or family?  Did he have a hidden agenda apart from what was in the article?</p>
          <p eId="para_186">If one wishes to present an article in a fair and reasonable manner how does one assess fairness and reasonableness?  I have a difficulty with those two words when I look at the picture on yesterday's newspaper.  This happened while we were debating the issue.  It leads me to ask whether there is any respect for the legislation we are attempting to put through.  It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">There are fine journalists around the House with whom I relate.  There are also good investigative journalists the work of whom we saw on television on Monday night last when discussing another interesting subject matter.  There is no control over the print media.  It puts a spin on the subject and gets everybody involved.  One cannot find out where the spin is but it is clear from the headline and the article there is no correlation between the two.  The information is fact but the spin can misinterpret it and destroy a reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">A key element of the Bill is that the press council will allow for the man in the street to pursue a correction of the headline.  That can be done by means of a written apology.  Words are cheap.  If a written apology is being provided for, will it get the same measure of a headline on the newspaper as the original headline which destroyed the character of the person or will it appear in some obscure part of the newspaper where nobody will notice it?  Then it is too late as the reputation of the person and his or her family and the community in which he or she lives is destroyed.  That is my concern.  It is easy to make an apology to which no liability is attached.  One can say one is very sorry, but the damage is done.  The damage was done to the Minister for Health and Children yesterday by that headline.  How can that statement be corrected?  I am concerned about the essence of the press council and whether it will have teeth.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I want us to work with the journalists and the press and I want trust.  I want fairness and loyalty but I do not want gutter as portrayed in the article.  Those in the Visitors Gallery are listening to this debate as well as those in the Chamber.  I want those in the Visitors Gallery to know that we try to do a good job in this House——</p>

Is it fair that a newspaper headline will destroy our reputation on some small issue and that a spin is put on it?  Will the press council correct that article?  It is all very fine in the case of a recent article involving a millionaire as he can pursue it all the way.  If it happens to the man in the street he goes to the ombudsman to have his case searched and to the press council which makes the decision on whether a code of standards will be applied.  I want those standards spelled out because standards can vary and can be interpreted differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">In regard to the composition of the press council, seven members will be independent and six will be from the press.  I am concerned about the quorum.  If the members travel from all over the country how many should be present at a meeting?</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Following what I read in yesterday's newspaper, I am concerned.  Last week I was convinced this was a great idea.  What was printed in yesterday's newspaper was an insult and destroys the good work the Minister is trying to do.  While I am sure many journalists are delighted the Minister is introducing this legislation, they flaunted it yesterday when they published that article.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_194">I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is a regular attendee.  It is difficult to follow Senator Ormonde who speaks with such passion.  I agree entirely with her, especially on the coverage of the death of Liam Lawlor, for which I have not seen the apology that was due, and also in regard to yesterday's coverage.  I will not speak with the strength of feeling that Senator Ormonde has.  On a previous occasion I mentioned to the Minister how I had been libelled in the <i>Irish News</i>.  Some 30 years ago if not more I tried to fly across the Irish Sea in a balloon for publicity purposes.  While I got publicity in the <i>Irish News</i>, it referred to me as “the former IRA man Feargal Quinn”.  I was rather upset and contacted the editor who promised to correct it immediately.  I got even more upset at the correction, which went to the pain of stating that it had confused me with my uncle and that I had nothing to do with the IRA.  It went on to state that I was so opposed to republicanism and Nationalism that I was almost a right-wing Tory.  I almost needed to get a correction to that piece as well.  However, at least it was corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I welcome with a certain sense of awe the arrival of the Bill before the House.  Many of us doubted it would ever see the light of day given that this subject is a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.  For many years it has been obvious that our defamation law was inadequate and against the national interest.  However, it seemed that in this area our political process was incapable of responding to a national need to have it changed.  Now the logjam has at last been broken, which alone is a cause for celebration.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">It is also worth celebrating that the Bill has arrived in this House alone and not accompanied by its much less desirable twin brother, the Privacy Bill 2006, which was mentioned earlier.  I take this as a sign that the original idea to tie the two measures together has been abandoned and if this is true, which I hope is the case, I applaud it as a wise course to take.  The Privacy Bill was spawned by the same political difficulty that kept us from considering new defamation legislation for all these years.  It is hard to disagree with the conclusion of many critics of that Bill that it would be in many respects a step backward rather than a step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">From one point of view, the Bill before us represents a gauntlet thrown down before the media interests.  This is because the success or otherwise of this legislation will depend very much on whether the Minister's proposed new press council and press ombudsman work in practice as they approach the difficult task of regulating or at least monitoring the media.  It is largely up to the media to ensure that this new system works to the benefit of all concerned.  I take Senator Ormonde's point that the front page of yesterday's newspaper, which I refuse to mention, was like throwing down a gauntlet to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The structure of the press council, which is recognised by the State while being independent of it and also independent from the vested interests concerned, is the right one for the job.  This form of structure, if it proves itself successful in this case, might offer us a model which could be followed in other areas in future.  Anything that cuts down the number of appointments in the gift of the Government of the day is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">This Defamation Bill is clearly a great improvement on what we have had up to now and I hope it will prove to be so in actual day-to-day operation.  However, the Bill does not go far enough in changing one aspect of our defamation law, which is a matter for regret.  The amount of damages to be awarded in a defamation case will still be decided by a jury.  I am a great supporter of the jury system.  In general it works very well for us and has done for many generations.  However, where the jury system works at its best is where the jury is charged with deciding on the facts of a case.  While a judge may direct a jury on the law it must follow, the jury's view on the truth or otherwise of the underlying facts is rightly held to be sacrosanct.  It is the jury's decision whether the facts are correct.  It brings a down-to-earth element into a legal system which otherwise might not be guaranteed always to follow the dictates of common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">However, in our criminal law, we rightly restrict the power of the jury to deciding on the facts.  If, God forbid, I lost the run of myself and decided to assassinate the Minister today, a jury would decide on whether I was guilty of that deed.  Having done so, that would be the end of its function.  It would not be up to the jury to decide what punishment I should suffer or whether I should be punished at all.  We rightly believe that when it comes to sentencing, the jury has no role.  That is where judges come into the picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">However, in civil matters the role of the jury is wider, which is a mistake.  To take the present instance, in a defamation case the jury is expected not only to decide whether a particular statement was defamatory, but also it is expected to decide how much the offended party should get by way of damages.  We have spent some time discussing this matter in the recent past and again today.  This requires the jury to range beyond the area of facts, where we rightly put a special premium on the common sense of ordinary citizens, and into a much more vague and murky area where the benefit of juries is less obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It is commonplace that people are always much more generous with other people's money than they would be with their own.  Even today someone suggested that a wealthy person could well afford it.  It is a widespread feeling among the public that the larger an organisation and the more impersonal it appears, the better it is equipped to pay large sums of money without apparent detriment to anybody.  For instance, people are very relaxed about the notion of insurance companies paying out very large sums while forgetting that they, as policy holders, eventually pay for it.  We have seen a great case being made recently in this regard, which has been very much influenced by the work of Senator O'Toole.  This is a major issue in the area of defamation, and it is a grave mistake to leave any such role for the jury in our reformed law.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The change envisaged in this Bill is that the judge is to have a role in directing the jury as to the amount of damages and that the amount awarded can be appealed to the Supreme Court, which indicates that the Minister is taking this matter into account to some extent.  However, there is no indication how this will work in practice.  Is the judge to direct the jury on the exact amount to be awarded?  If so, it is a sham to involve the jury at all.  Will the judge offer a range of figures to the jury within which it must operate, or a maximum figure it must not exceed?  If that is to be the way, there is little point in bringing the jury into the matter again after it has done the major job we expect of it — deciding on the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">There is also the issue of how exactly the judge is to arrive at his or her direction, in whatever form it takes.  Assessing in monetary terms the impact of a defamatory statement is highly subjective, much more so, for instance, than assessing compensation for a physical injury.  There is no particular reason to believe that a judge's legal training makes him or her more skilled in making such an assessment than a lay person.  A further question arises of different judges having perhaps widely different views on the appropriate amount of damages.  The Bill should specify an official system of damages, a tariff that would set out the broad parameters of damages that can be awarded in particular cases.  While I realise it will not be as easy to draw up such a tariff as it is in the case of physical injuries, it is surely not beyond the wit of man to do so.  In any case, such an approach is infinitely better than relying on the different intuitions of a range of judges.  The amounts set out in the tariff could be adjusted from time to time by ministerial order to take into account changing circumstances over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I welcome the Bill and the input of the Minister and his officials, particularly after such a long wait.  However, I do so with reservations so long as this flaw remains in our approach to defamation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_206">I welcome this Bill.  It is important that it has the support — which I am sure was not easily won — of all the major interests.  The question remains whether there should be privacy legislation in place to complement it.  The media have condemned out of court the introduction of any such legislation.  Can it be their position that nobody has any right to privacy?  In practice, it often boils down to where one draws the right to privacy of public figures.  This is an issue that requires further discussion and consideration but it should not be dismissed out of court.  Those in the media have a responsibility to bring forward constructive suggestions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I approach this Bill from a similar angle to that taken by Senator Maurice Hayes, which is neither particularly from the point of the view of the political class nor particularly from the perspective of the media.  The reality is that it is dangerous for private individuals to take a libel case unless they have access to exceptional means.  We saw recently how two public figures, one a Member of the other House and the other a senior public servant, came to grief as a result of taking cases.  An element of such difficulties is the cost of litigation.  The Competition Authority's report suggests that lawyers want to ensure we all have access to a Rolls Royce system.  The difficulty, however, is that the vast majority of us cannot afford a Rolls Royce.  This is something that must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">When I was doing my doctorate on 18th century French history, relating to events well before the revolution, I discovered there were proposals at that time regarding a free system of justice and the breaking down of barriers between solicitors and barristers.  It is telling that this type of discussion was taking place during the <i>ancien régime</i> but the matter has still not been resolved.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_209">I thought for a moment that Senator Mansergh was suggesting he had started his doctorate before the French Revolution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_210">No.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Senator Ormonde is correct that the Bill covers only a fraction of those matters to which one might take exception in the media.  It will not get rid of scurrility in objective terms or what one might consider to be such.  There is no way of doing that other than under the auspices of some type of authoritarian régime.  Politicians are in a more advantageous position than most in that we have platforms from which we can reply.  I am firm believer in the view that politicians, even when maligned, should, if possible, fight their case in the court of public opinion rather than in the courts of law.  With all due respect to the Minister, I contend that politics and law do not mix particularly well.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The levels of damages awarded in such cases often seem disproportionate.  In many instances, high damages may simply go to pay high barristers' fees.  The purpose of a press council is to provide a relatively expeditious and inexpensive way of setting one's reputation right.  I am not sure that at least that remedy should not apply to those who are connected to the recently dead.  I fully accept there cannot be monetary considerations applying in such instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The provision in section 7 that the plaintiff must swear an affidavit is welcome.  There have been libel cases, not necessarily in this State, where it subsequently transpired that what was alleged to be libellous was entirely true.  I have some reservations in regard to subsection (9) of this section, which provides that the defendant is "entitled to cross examine the plaintiff in relation to any statement made by the plaintiff in the affidavit".  I recall an instance where I was being potentially libelled and the advice I received was that while it was true that one was not doing X, people with deep pockets may wish to inquire as to whether one is doing Y or Z.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Section 13 sets out how a court should deal with a defamation action.  There is a difficulty, however, in that people often avoid charges of libel by making indirect references or allusions.  These provisions will be subject to varied interpretation in this regard.  If I were a newspaper proprietor, I would not be sure where I might stand in a case where a plaintiff could reasonably say that an indirect allusion applies to them.  It will all depend on the content of the statement in question, but I wonder whether the definitions are somewhat loose.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The point I am about to make may bring bricks falling around my head.  I do not like absolutism of any type and it is for this reason that I have some concerns about the references to absolute privilege.  I understand and defend the reasons that Members of the Oireachtas enjoy such privilege.  There are cases, however, where that privilege has been abused to allege that named persons have committed all types of crimes.  This has happened in the House of Commons, for example.  Such allegations may put the accused person's life in danger.  The Finucane case involved one of the most disgraceful statements ever made by a Minister in the House of Commons.  I am glad this person's career did not subsequently flourish.  Perhaps there should be some parliamentary mechanism whereby Members could be censured for abuse of privilege.  The Committees on Procedure and Privileges may already have some powers in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Section 17 (1)(<i>a</i>) provides that a defence of qualified privilege will fail if the plaintiff proves the defendant did not believe the statement in respect of which the action was brought to be true or that the defendant acted in bad faith.  It seems virtually impossible to prove that a defendant made a statement in bad faith.  People are capable of continuing to believe in the face of all the evidence, the most extraordinary statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I welcome section 24(2)(<i>c</i>), which provides for the context and content, including the language used, of the statement.  This will encourage moderation in language used.  A recent editorial in <i>Village</i> magazine rubbished the press council proposal, not from a press point of view, but on the grounds the media will run a coach and horses through it as they are only interested in making a profit.  I hope the council will work and do so in good faith.  It is as much in the interest of the media as anyone else that proper standards are maintained.  If it does not work, the problem will subsist and other remedies may have to be found.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_218">I thank Senators for the general welcome given to the Bill.  It depended on a prior consultation process which, as acknowledged by many Members, was a broad process and an attempt to bring balance and consensus where it did not seem possible.  I thank those who participated in that process because, broadly speaking, the terms of the Bill now command a sufficient consensus.  I bear in mind that Senator Norris is unhappy with the legislation.  I am not asserting it has unanimous support from the House.  However, its principles have close to unanimous support, whatever about some of the details that can be debated on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The Bill was designed to bring our law into conformity with developments among other common law countries.  I believe in a free press.  Our media must be inquiring, searching, brave and cannot be subject to the Government of the day or the governing class.  It is the essence of democracy that the people know what is happening and, therefore, the Government does not have a monopoly on the means of knowledge of what is happening.  The Constitution describes the role of the media as educating public opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It is not always comfortable when one is in office, or aspiring to office, to be judged by the media.  With the exception of the broadcast media, it has no obligation to be fair or objective.  It is entitled to be partial and unfair in the way it deals with people.  There is no objective standard of fairness and we are entitled to have highly political newspapers, whether it is <i>An Phoblacht</i>, a tabloid or a broadsheet.  They are entitled to be opinionated and have their own agendas which is what a democracy is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">John Lloyd, a noted English commentator and former deputy editor of an English periodical, has written extensively on what the media is doing to politics.  I am not courting controversy but I believe there is a vindictive and destructive streak in the media when it comes to elected public representatives.  This is not omnipresent but sometimes emerges in a way that is unfortunate.  We live in a democracy.  Those elected to govern and represent the people are chosen by the people.  They deserve at least the respect of having been chosen.  Nobody chooses the editor of a newspaper or who writes in this newspaper or that.  There is no process where the readers of a newspaper are entitled to send a columnist out of office or suspend their right to comment.  Mr. Lloyd's thesis is that the media has set itself up as agenda-setters in the political process.  It is very well for it to set agendas and pose difficult questions.  However, where agendas are pursued, the public is entitled to draw its own conclusions without being deliberately misinformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">On one occasion I delivered a speech to the House in Irish.  It was my long-standing intention as Minister to do so in both Houses as our national language should be used by Ministers.  Out of courtesy I took the step of ensuring that every Member who, like myself, was not fluent in Irish could follow the speech by circulating the text in English.  A Sunday newspaper announced I had done this because I had an agenda and wished to conceal the content of my actions.  When the newspaper telephoned my press office, it was told an English text had also been circulated on the occasion.  This fact did not suit the newspaper's thesis that I was trying to pull the wool over Members' eyes.  It was deliberately ignored and a headline and article was generated which deliberately kept away from the reader that an English text had been circulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I asked a journalist and assistant editor in <i>The New York Times</i> about its procedures when a complaint is made about an article.  <i>The New York Times</i> is obliged to give both sides of a story.  The journalist of the piece must explain to the editor how material relevant to informing the reader was omitted from a story.  A journalist is held to account to a standard of ethics.  Why can we not have more of that in our system of reportage?  It is not necessary to spin a story one way to get across an editorial value.  If an editorial value has any validity, being even-handed in presenting the facts will not detract from the reader’s capacity to decide whether he or she agrees with the editor’s views.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The media, undoubtedly, aspires to being formers of opinion.  If they are forming opinion, there is a moral obligation, in a democratic society, to be even handed with the facts and not to mislead readers in pursuit of agenda items.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">I believe it is self evidently true that the editor of a national newspaper is at least as powerful a figure in Irish society as a Member of this House who does not hold ministerial office or a backbencher in the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">A question then arises as to what accountability there is for such a person when huge standards of accountability are demanded of individual elected politicians.  Is it relevant, for example, to the Prime Minister's office that the British Prime Minister's son got merry and was brought home by police because the Prime Minister has made speeches on public order issues?  Is it relevant that the son of a newspaper editor who has been writing editorials on the same issue has been taken home by the police?  I doubt that most newspaper editors would concede that it is.  They would be extremely bitter if rival publications were to trot out the type of stuff politicians must endure.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There was a particular case in the recent past where the circumstances of the death of a nephew of an office holder in this democracy, in a hotel in Spain, was the subject of appalling invasions of the family's privacy and grief.  The connection with the politician was exiguous but the detail and the degrading material that was published was revolting.  It was done purely on the basis that it was fair game to publish this material because the individual in question was a nephew of a politician.  I reject that.  If I gave the details in this House of the death of a nephew of a newspaper editor, on the basis that the editor was an opinion former as influential as most Members of these Houses, I would be subject to censure and revilement for doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I would be censured and held in the lowest esteem for doing that to a newspaper editor.  Is there any responsibility attached to the power of the media and is there any sense of obligation to be truthful?</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Members of the House have referred to what was published in one of yesterday's newspapers.  I spoke about that to the former Tánaiste last night.  I said I would take the opportunity of this debate today to express my revulsion at what I had seen.  She is a gentle and decent person.  She said, "Please, do not.  It will only add petrol to the flames and reignite the controversy."  Her decency contrasts dramatically with the cowardice of whoever would do that with a newspaper.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Senator O'Toole sought clarification on the question of qualified privilege.  Section 16(3) refers to two elements.  It is a defence in a defamation action to prove that the statement concerned was contained in a publication or a report specified in Schedule 1, which is privileged, without explanation or contradiction.  This includes parliamentary and court proceedings.  However, Part 2 of Schedule 1 sets out a number of occasions where published statements are subject to explanation or contradiction and the defence may be lost where the publisher refuses or fails to publish a reasonable statement by the complainant by way of explanation or contradiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">That is the distinction between the two Parts of Schedule 1 of the Bill.  The first is where there is qualified privilege, without any obligation to allow the person who would be defamed an opportunity to comment.  The second is where somebody is entitled, when something is reported as fact and is damaging to them, to have his or her side of the story included as well.  I hope Senator O'Toole is satisfied with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Senator Quinn raised the issue of juries having a role in deciding damages.  The problem is that where a jury decides there has been a defamation and the judge is to assess the damages, the judge might radically disagree with the jury on the case.  The judge might think the report is true and agree with the defence counsel throughout the case and disagree with the jury's verdict.  To ask a judge to award damages on the basis of a verdict by which the judge is unconvinced would be difficult.  That would be the case particularly if aggravated or punitive damages were in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">It is important not to have the current situation whereby nobody can talk about amounts of money to a jury.  When considering somebody's loss of reputation and what would be adequate compensation for that or for damage to his or her reputation, surely it must be relevant that the Supreme Court has stated in a number of cases that there is an overall limit to what can be given by way of general damages to a person who suffers personal injuries.  If one is in a wheelchair, a jury cannot go mad and award one €3 million or €4 million for the loss of the use of one's lower limbs.  I do not know what sum would be awarded now to a paraplegic or quadriplegic but it probably would be between €250,000 and €500,000.  If that can be the rule of law in such cases, a corresponding rule of law should apply in the case of compensatory damages for libel.  In those circumstances it is not wrong that figures can be mentioned to a jury by way of general guidance and it is not necessary to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Under this legislation the Supreme Court has the power to vary the award and substitute its own award rather than send the matter back for retrial.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">My final point relates to the press council's powers.  The press council and the ombudsman can, "provide for the taking of remedial action by the member of the Press Council in respect of whom the complaint was made consisting of any or all of the following: (i) the publication of the decision of the Press Ombudsman and by such members of the Press Council as he or she directs and in such form and manner as he or she directs...".  Form and manner in that case would refer to the size of the publication and the way it is to be carried.  I agree with the general consensus in the House that it is astonishing how disproportionate apologies are in terms of space, location and prominence compared to the original defamatory stories.  Occasionally people insist on front page apologies and more power to them, as far as I am concerned.  In those circumstances, at least, they have a guarantee that a large number of people will have read the apology.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I thank the Members for their reasoned and enlightening comments on the Bill.  I take on board what Senator Mansergh said, that if there is a problem with protecting privacy it is incumbent on those who see a problem with the proposals published by the Government to suggest alternative proposals.  If there is an actionable tort of invasion of privacy, which no lawyer denies, that should be acknowledged.  It should not be a cause of action which exists in theory but is not mentioned in any statute book.  If it is actionable, I appreciate that the media is concerned about the pre-emptive injunction, which it believes would prevent investigative journalism from taking place and allow the rich and powerful to prevent particular areas of their lives and affairs from being investigated.  That is fine, and we will examine the question of pre-emption and see if the Bill has struck a wrong balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I did not conjure the circumstances in which an Irish newspaper sent photographers disguised as medical staff into the hospital room of a prominent broadcast journalist shortly after she delivered her child.  That was a breach of her privacy and it was her right to stop those photographs from being published by some means if she wanted to do so.  While we can argue until the cows come home about right and wrong, this is not an imaginary situation.  We are dealing with the upholding of decent standards.  If the print media is committed to upholding decent standards we look to the council, which is in the process of formation, and to what we see to evaluate whether there is a commitment in good faith to protecting decent, innocent people from being unfairly damaged by the media.  Like many Senators here I have attempted to be fair to all sides and strike a balance in this legislation.  Extremists on all sides have accused me of going too far in the other direction and I have attempted to establish a middle way with this legislation.  I wonder if other people have the same appetite for fairness that I have.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I do not intend simply to reprise the findings of the various reports which arise for consideration.  Reports from eminent persons that are critical of the Garda Síochána are not to be taken lightly.  What I am about to say and, more importantly, what I have done clearly illustrates that they have not been.  The programme of reform was a recognition that fundamental issues affecting the Garda Síochána had to be urgently addressed, even before the publication of the critical reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The Morris reports have been, as they must be, the subject matter of strong action on the part of the Government.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 is the most profound legislation relating to the Garda Síochána in the history of the State and facilitates change.  The inspiration for many of its provisions arise from the fallout from the events in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">That Act recasts in statute form the formal relationship between the Executive, the Minister, the Oireachtas and the Garda Síochána as well as the force's relationship with local government.  It imposes a clear statutory duty on every member of the force to account for his or her action or inaction while on duty when required to do so by a member of higher rank.  Failure to do so is sufficient grounds for disciplinary action that may lead to dismissal.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Garda Síochána has changed greatly in the past ten years and we are in the midst of a new era of reform that will impact on quality of the service it provides.  The Government has acted firmly and radically to ensure that the culture and organisation of the Garda Síochána is fully fit for its purpose.  Various measures signify reform on an unprecedented scale, including the establishment of the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which will commence operations in the new year; the establishment of the Garda inspectorate and the appointment of Chief Inspector Kathleen O'Toole and her two fellow inspectors; and the appointment of the four person civilian expert group chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes to advise the Commissioner on the development of management and leadership skills for senior officers, including the promotion of a culture of performance management and accountability, the development of human resource management and succession planning and the development of specialist skills and enhanced training for members and staff of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Other measures include the establishment of a Garda reserve, the establishment of local policing committees and the creation of the post of deputy Garda commissioner to lead a dedicated change management team and the establishment of a professional standards unit in the Garda Síochána to address performance, effectiveness and efficiency across all levels of policing activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The enactment of the provisions of the Act provide for greater accountability of members of the service.  New discipline regulations, new promotion regulations and a whistleblowers charter signify reform on an unprecedented scale that goes to the core of policing in this country.  These measures will be implemented and confidence and trust will be restored in the Garda Síochána, as our citizens deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">This State has good reason to be grateful to the majority of diligent, courageous and upstanding members of the Garda Síochána who have served it well since independence.  This sentiment will continue to prevail in the public mind as the Garda Síochána continues its unprecedented expansion through a major recruitment drive for trainee and reserve gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Since I and my predecessor have taken up office, we have continually increased the financial and human resources made available to the force.  Unlike the Opposition, which oversaw a decrease in the size of the Garda Síochána when in power, we have increased the size of the force.  I have honoured the Government commitment and overseen the recruitment of a further 2,000 Garda trainees.  The force is now more than 20% bigger in size than it was in 1997.  The number of fully trained gardaí exceeded 13,000 in November and will reach 14,000 in early 2008.  The Garda budget is now more than €1.3 billion, 85% higher than in 1997.  I have assured the Garda Commissioner that he will not be lacking resources when it comes to fighting crime.  Regarding matters happening today, on which I do not wish to dwell, I have assured the Commissioner that I will provide any resources necessary to the fight against gangland and drug related crime in Ireland.  I have the backing of the Taoiseach and the Government regarding that assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I refer to those inquiries that have looked at allegations of wrongdoing by members of the Garda Síochána.  We have the opportunity today to address the issues raised in six of these reports, namely, the reports of Mr. Justice Frederick Morris on the Ardara, Silver Bullet and Burnfoot modules of his tribunal's work, the report of Mr. Justice Robert Barr regarding his tribunal's inquiry into the fatal shooting of Mr. John Carthy, the report of Mr. George Birmingham regarding his commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case, and the report of Mr. Dermot Nally, Mr. Joseph Brosnan and Mr. Eamon Barnes regarding the report submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland raising concerns about the alleged activity of certain Garda officers during 1998 regarding the Omagh bombing.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">With regard to the findings of Mr Justice Morris, the Government took the unusual step last May of issuing a statement on the contents of the reports even though publication was not permitted at that stage without the permission of the High Court owing to an impending criminal trial.  That step was taken because of the serious implications of the report's conclusions for the force.  The conduct of Detective Sergeant John White is impugned in all three reports, notwithstanding the fact that they deal with separate incidents.  Detective Sergeant White is also the focus of the Nally report, to which I shall return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Of particular note is the Burnfoot report which concludes that Detective Sergeant White and Detective Garda Thomas Kilcoyne deliberately planted a weapon at a campsite of Irish Travellers on 22 May 1998.  This was done, it is alleged, with a view to ensuring that a search in respect of which warrants were issued under section 29 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 would be successful and facilitate an arrest under section 30 of that Act.  Furthermore, the tribunal concluded that Detective Sergeant Conaty, Garda Mulligan and Garda Leonard entered into a conspiracy, a primary motivation being to help Detective Sergeant White escape a criminal charge.  Two of the foregoing members, Garda Mulligan and Garda Leonard, have since been dismissed and a further member, Sergeant Conaty, is retired.  Detective Sergeant White is the subject of a disciplinary process under section 14 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">A common theme in both the Ardara and Burnfoot reports was a shocking abuse of process by members of An Garda Síochána in order to make the provisions of the Offences against the State Acts available to them when making arrests.  The tribunal recommends that urgent consideration be given to vesting the power to issue warrants, under section 29 of that Act, in judges of the District Court and Circuit Court rather than in officers of An Garda Síochána not below the level of superintendent, as at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The tribunal recognises there are very limited occasions upon which time would be so pressing as to make it impossible to follow such a procedure and that, in any event, a residual power for such eventuality could perhaps still be vested in a senior officer of An Garda Síochána, to be used in exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I fully share the tribunal's concerns about the abuse of warrants issued under section 29 and accept the recommendation of the tribunal to the effect that statutory provisions in this regard should be considered.  In the light of the findings of the tribunal I did not proceed with proposals in the Criminal Justice Act, based on recommendations by an expert group on the criminal law, to extend the search warrant powers available to the Garda pending consideration of the issues raised by the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I propose to address this issue by way of amending legislation.  My intention is to propose provisions which will replace section 29 so as to define as closely as possible the exceptional circumstances in which warrants may be issued by members of An Garda Síochána.  I intend to designate a rank higher than superintendent to perform this function, place very strict timescales on such warrants and introduce an effective element of oversight, including documentary recording of the transactions, independent of An Garda Síochána on the operation of such warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Detective Sergeant White is also a central player in the Nally report, as I have mentioned.  On 22 March 2002, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O'Loan — an officer from outside the jurisdiction to whom Detective Sergeant White chose to make certain allegations — presented a report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on these allegations.  My predecessor then established a group under the former Secretary to the Government, Mr. Dermot Nally, which included Mr. Joe Brosnan, former Secretary General of my Department and now a member of the International Monitoring Commission.  It also included Mr. Eamon Barnes, former Director of Public Prosecutions, to examine matters arising from that report.  The group reported in mid 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">During the course of a debate in Dáil Éireann on the report in February 2004, I promised to produce an edited version of the report once criminal proceedings against Detective Sergeant White were disposed of.  This commitment was given not on the basis that any public interest would be served in disseminating allegations which had been found to be baseless but in deference to the wishes of the families of the victims of the Omagh atrocity, which marked one of the darkest days in the history of this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">However, that commitment was subject to the understanding that even with the criminal proceedings being disposed of, I could not publish the report in full because of the security sensitivity of some of the information it contained.  The reason for this is that the subject matter of the report, to use the words of the group which prepared it:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_259">. . . deals with highly sensitive matters involving the security of the State and possible risk to the lives of individuals.  It also describes Garda operational procedures and methods, public disclosure of which could adversely affect future operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I believe I have given effect to my commitment by placing copies of a heavily edited version of the report in the Oireachtas Library and making copies available to all Deputies and Senators in advance of this debate.  Copies have also been made available to the Omagh families.  I hope this edited version will be seen as a legitimate balance between the public interest in full accountability and the exigencies of the security requirements of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The main allegations made by Detective Sergeant White against senior members of An Garda Síochána are a matter of public record, as are the principal findings of the Nally group.  In essence, the Nally group concluded:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_262">. . . that there is no foundation for the allegations made . . . and that those allegations were a direct consequence of and were motivated solely by concerns arising from the difficulties in which he [Detective Sergeant White] found himself with his superiors in the Garda Síochána and with the criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In so far as Omagh is concerned, the main suggestion in the public domain was to the effect that the Garda failed to pass on to the RUC information which could have prevented the Omagh bombing.  As Senators will observe from the edited version of the Nally report, no such allegation was ever made to the group.  The core allegations about events preceding the Omagh bombing were that a senior Garda officer would have been prepared, if a vehicle had in fact been stolen, to allow it to go through in order to protect an informant; and that no intelligence was passed to the RUC about information, alleged to have been received on the eve of Omagh that the Real IRA, who had been trying to steal a vehicle in the Dublin area, had obtained one elsewhere, with place, vehicle type and destination unspecified.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I emphasise that these allegations, although very serious, are quite different from allegations claiming that the Garda could actually have prevented the Omagh bombing.  As I have already mentioned, the Nally group found that there is simply no basis whatsoever for these allegations and that they were motivated solely by base reasons, involving the dishonourable abuse of the grief of the Omagh victims' families.  I wish to put on the record of this House the fact that all three members of the Nally group consider the edited version to be a fair account of both the allegations relating to the Omagh bombing and their findings on those allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Barr Report comprises 741 pages and represents the fruits of approximately three and a half years of evidence gathering and analysis, dealing at times with decisions that had to be made in seconds.  In dealing with its findings I must urge Senators to ensure that its conclusions are contextualised by reference to general circumstances of the so-called Abbeylara siege.  The events at Abbeylara in April 2000 were grave and unique in the Irish police experience, very difficult to contend with and a far cry from the crisis situations for which the emergency response unit and the Garda Síochána were trained to contend.  These are not my words but those of Mr. Justice Barr.  Those words and that context were not well canvassed in public discourse on the matter and did a disservice to many of those who were involved.  It is only fair to canvass them now in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It is not our purpose to second-guess Mr. Justice Barr's findings or the weight he chose to give to particular evidence and the analysis which led to his conclusions, with some of which I have some difficulty.  Whatever one's views on the report, no Member would wish to understate the difficulties faced by An Garda Síochána in dealing with situations such as these.  While lessons must be learned and changes have been made, we must recognise that An Garda Síochána, in dealing with people using or threatening to use firearms, must not hesitate in taking whatever action is necessary to protect their own lives and those of innocent third parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">In short, Mr. Justice Barr criticised Garda performance in the Abbeylara siege, particularly with regard to command structures and training in siege situations where a person armed with a gun may be affected by mental illness.  The Garda Commissioner appointed a high level group to look into the issues raised by the Barr report, and it has extracted from the report the matters outlined in the tribunal's report which impact on the policing or operational areas.  Each issue identified has been considered and followed up where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Since the tragic events of 20 April 2000, very significant developments have taken place within An Garda Síochána in the context of the management of critical events.  Most significant of these was the issue of the On Scene Commander Manual of Guidance.  It is also fair to say the handling of the similar type occurrence in recent times by the Garda Síochána has shown that it has learned lessons from Abbeylara and is putting some of those into practice.  In addition, I have forwarded a copy of the report to the chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate so that Garda procedures and practices for dealing with incidents of the type which unfolded at Abbeylara might be reviewed.  I understand from the Garda Inspectorate that work on a report in this regard is well-advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Chapter 13 of the report deals with "Gun licensing law and related matters" and suggests consideration of proposed improvements to our laws in this country.  I am pleased to indicate that the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which was signed into law on 16 July 2006 provides for significant amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 to meet the concerns raised by Mr. Justice Barr.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Birmingham report offers a thorough independent analysis of the facts surrounding the false confession made by Dean Lyons based on the evidence of all relevant witnesses.  It is the first report to be completed under the mechanism provided for under the Commission of Investigation Act 2004, an alternative to statutory tribunals of inquiry.  Senators will recall the mechanism was introduced by me on the grounds that the very public and sometimes adversarial nature of tribunals of inquiry does not lend itself easily to timely and cost-effective investigations.  The commission of investigation mechanism contained several new features intended to achieve that goal without compromising or encroaching upon the proper conduct of an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Mr. Birmingham's inquiry was completed in six months and cost approximately €1 million.  We must reflect the costs associated with the Barr tribunal on Abbeylara which took three and a half years were approximately €20 million.  The body politic must have a variety of inquisitorial instruments available to it.  These facts speak for themselves.  Without any implied criticism, the contrast between the cost and length of the Birmingham and Barr inquiries deserves reflection in view of the fact that each inquiry dealt with subjects of comparable complexity.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">George Birmingham concludes no deliberate attempt was made to undermine the rights of Dean Lyons.  His view is that inappropriate leading questions asked by interviewing gardaí were central to what transpired.  He points out one of the main Garda conduits to Dean Lyons of the ultimately damning information was the loudest voice in his defence at subsequent case conferences.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The complexity of Dean Lyons's vulnerable personality was shown by the fact that his guilty plea was no mere fleeting admission made in an oppressive interview room and immediately recanted.  On the contrary, Dean Lyons's complex and vulnerable personality gave rise to a situation whereby he maintained his own guilt long after his admissions came about, not only to the Garda Síochána but to a wide variety of other persons including his legal advisers and family members.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Mr. Birmingham also points out Dean Lyons's most elaborate and extensive admissions were made after he took the methadone prescribed for him while he was in custody.  Furthermore, his vulnerability was disguised by his relatively high verbal skill.  In other words, Mr. Birmingham concludes Dean Lyons's difficulties would not have been immediately obvious to a stranger.  The report criticises the failure of the team to notify the DPP about the doubts which existed within it, doubts which the report concludes were raised at case conferences despite the denials of some members of the management team.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The decision of the original investigation team three months after its original recommendation to recommend to the DPP that the existing charge of murder against Dean Lyons should proceed and that an additional charge should be laid in respect of the second fatality is described by Mr. Birmingham as "difficult to understand and even harder to justify".  This comment was made in the light of the fact that at the time Assistant Commissioner James McHugh was in the process of conducting an analysis of the various admissions on behalf of the Commissioner.  This analysis ultimately contributed to the DPP's decision to drop the charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">To date, no-one has been brought to trial for these brutal murders.  This is a heavy burden for the families and friends of Dean Lyons and the victims of the murders to bear.  It is my firm view the three Morris reports and the Barr and Birmingham reports demand an analysis which transcends their individual circumstances if we are to get full value from them.  I believe they tell us quite a lot about what is wrong and what needs to be done to improve the performance of the Garda Síochána in the way required.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">One issue which clearly emerges is the weakness of management at senior level in the Garda Síochána.  It neither gives full leadership nor actively manages in a way which utilises the resources available to the Garda Síochána to best advantage.  These leadership failures are matters of the most profound seriousness.  The fact they are manifest in different ways in each of the reports must tell us something.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In order to maximise levels of performance in a sustainable way it is self-evident that the brightest and best must operate at senior levels within the force.  The first and most obvious issue is that of selection, more particularly the question of promotion practices within the Garda Síochána.  New promotion regulations were agreed by Government.  These new regulations will bring about significant modernisation of the system for promotion within the Garda Síochána.  They formalise the requirement for promotion to be based on merit and for all competitions to be held in a manner which is fair, impartial and objective; in line with best practice; consistent throughout and open, accountable and transparent.  These principles, combined with the introduction of additional external expertise in selecting candidates for promotion within the force, will result in a system which reflects current best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">It is clear from earlier reports by Mr. Justice Morris that the churning of appointments and short-stay appointments to divisional positions is a serious problem within the Garda Síochána.  It is pointless to appoint somebody on a constant merry-go-round basis to be chief superintendent in County Donegal if, by the time he or she is sitting at the desk he or she is being prepared for career advancement.  This applies at every level of the force.  We must put in place a regionalised system with a degree of permanence and time commitment by individuals to the area to which they are promoted to supervise and manage.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I recently established a four person advisory group to advise the Garda Commissioner on issues of management and leadership development in the force.  I asked Senator Maurice Hayes to chair it and he kindly agreed.  At the same time, the newly established Garda Síochána Inspectorate, in keeping with its statutory role of providing independent advice on matters of policing, addressed the issue of the appropriate management structures at senior level in its first report.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Both groups set about their tasks with diligence and produced reports which deal with management and the structures needed to facilitate optimum performance in the Garda organisation.  These reports are seminal and timely documents at this juncture in the redevelopment of the Garda Síochána, with an acceptance on the part of the Commissioner and senior officers of the need for change and the Garda Síochána Act reforms being implemented across the entire organisation.  The Garda Síochána Act is the trellis on which genuine reform can be trained and made effective.  The Act is not the be-all and end-all of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I accept the recommendations contained in these reports.  It is crucial the appropriate structures and systems are put in place at senior level to carry the changes through.  I fully agree these changes should have been made years ago but for whatever reason they were not.  They are happening now.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I wish to make one point about these reports, a point made by Senator Maurice Hayes in the media.  The advisory group under Senator Hayes comprises people with considerable experience in managing large and complex organisations going through a period of change in an environment that was also changing.  The Garda inspectorate brings an international and modern policing perspective to the table.  It is instructive to see how both bodies independently of each other reached similar conclusions on many issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">A number of changes are taking place within the force at present and more will occur.  It is not possible for me to go into detail on each of them in the time available.  For the record, I listed them at the outset of my speech today.  However, legislative and organisational change is not enough.  A willingness to embrace change from the top down is also required.  So far, my experience is that the appetite for change within the force itself is strong at all levels.  Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Commissioner Noel Conroy and his senior management team for their wholehearted support for and co-operation with this process of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">These are difficult times for the Garda Síochána.  I have no doubt that in three or five years' time, whenever it may be, it will be recognised that in his tenure of office, Commissioner Conroy presided over the difficult obligation, which was sometimes a poisoned chalice, of bringing about major reform to an organisation which was justly proud of its previous traditions and conservative on agendas for change.  I do not doubt the Commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners fully recognise the need for far-reaching reform of the way the force is managed, such as the introduction of civilian staff and administrative staff to assist.  In that context, we have a great deal to look forward to in the change which is only starting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the Minister to the House.  A total of 23 people were shot dead this year in this country.  More than 60 violent murders occurred.  Gun crime reached epidemic proportions.  Drugs are more freely available than ever before.  This is the legacy of the Government.  I think of the personal attacks and abuse the former Minister with responsibility for justice, Nora Owen, received.  I shudder to think what it would be like if she presided over the lawless situation we now have.  The challenges for the Garda Síochána are great.  Ireland has benefited greatly from the Garda Síochána, a body of dedicated men and women with a proud tradition of service since the foundation of the State.  We are blessed in having an unarmed police force, something about which we should be proud.  We owe the founders of the State a debt of gratitude as a result of this.  Through the early years of the Free State and, more recently, during the Troubles, the Garda has acted to secure our State and protect our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">However, in recent years, we have suffered and the Garda has certainly suffered from the deplorable actions of a number of individuals which have been widely publicised in the media.  The revelations made by the Morris tribunal and the Nally report have severely damaged the Garda Síochána and deeply affected public confidence in the organisation.  There now exists an alarming situation whereby some members of the public second-guess the motivation of decisions of gardaí, doubt the bona fides of individual members and question the honesty of the force as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">There is no question that revelations of Garda behaviour in Donegal were shocking in the extreme.  Many of us could not even believe that there were gardaí who had the audacity to undermine the rule of law so subversively and deliberately to deprive innocent citizens of their rights to liberty, due process and the presumption of innocence, to name but a few.  However, others were not surprised in the least because they had seen at first hand the actions of some individuals within the Garda which were, in no uncertain terms, corrupt, unscrupulous and ruthless.  Even worse was the evidence of indiscipline and, in some instances, cover-ups and the indications of the development of a culture far removed from the essential core mission of the Garda, which is to serve the State and its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">What happened in Donegal left much to be desired and needs to be tackled.  It is incumbent on us all to confront this decline in confidence, address the root causes of it and implement changes and reforms that will truly turn around the Garda, not just in terms of public perception but in terms of the proper organisation of the force.  The Garda must be seen as a proper organisation to implement policies that will generate confidence in the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Garda must be equipped to deal with 21st century problems.  I welcome the fact that the Minister stated here today that he has informed the Garda Commissioner that any resources he requires will be furnished to him to tackle gang crime.  I always suggest that it is better late than never, certainly where gang crime, which is despicable at the moment, is concerned.  People in communities fear for their lives because of the lawlessness on our streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Fine Gael wants the Garda to be the best police force in the world.  We do not want it just to be good or adequate.  We want an excellent force which is widely referred to as such throughout the globe.  We would expect optimum results in the prevention and detection of crime from such a force.  What would we do differently if we were in Government?  Fine Gael believes we need to implement measures and change at two different levels.  The first is at an organisational level which involves bringing institutional change to an outdated structure and bringing it into line with best international practice, thereby returning accountability and transparency to a force desperately in need of them.  The second is at community level where there is a need for communities to be policed by real, dedicated Garda officers whose only concern is the welfare and safety of the community, which is paramount if we are to restore public confidence in our police force.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Garda Síochána Act 2005, which we supported, goes some way towards this, but much more needs to be done.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that.  In respect of institutional changes we believe are necessary, the time is right to establish an independent Garda authority, incorporating the existing Garda inspectorate, whose function would be to drive the agenda for reform and ensure the measures are implemented rather than put on the long finger, which the Minister acknowledged has happened.  The authority would have a clear remit and would inject professionalism and modernism into a force that has served the country well but which now needs to be updated.  I think we are all of the same opinion in this regard.  The idea is that there should be an overarching body taking responsibility for implementing best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The Garda can borrow extensively from the corporate and private sector in this regard.  All major companies in Ireland manage their development through systems such as this.  They ensure they monitor the trends amongst their competitors, modernise and even keep ahead of the pace.  These ideas should govern the thinking in Garda management in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The Garda Commissioner needs to be looking constantly at policing organisations, comparing, contrasting, taking the good and benefiting from expertise in similar jurisdictions throughout the world.  This is why I believe an authority would comprise civilians with extensive experience of change management and strategy in both public and private sector positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The independent Garda authority would drive an agenda for root and branch reform in a number of areas.  It would radically revise Garda rostering which wastes huge levels of Garda resources every year.  The new authority would demand international best practice in areas of management, including taking responsibility for recommending senior Garda appointments to the Government and opening Garda recruitment to external candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I recognise that civilianisation has begun, but we have been saying for the past ten years that this should happen.  I am glad the expertise of civilians is now being brought into the force.  When he became Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani gave a commitment to deal with law and order issues in that city.  One of the measures he introduced was COMSTAT, a system for comparing and contrasting performance in precincts in the city.  This system or a variation of it could be very useful in addressing the discrepancies in Garda regional successes.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Fine Gael has always highlighted the huge differences in detection rates throughout the country.  There should be little or no difference between Garda regions or divisions.  A person robbed in Tramore should expect the thief to be caught as much as a person in Tralee or Tallaght.  The authority would also review the use of the annual budget, report to the Minister on progress in given policy areas, ensure inter-agency co-operation, maintain close ties with the Northern Ireland Policing Board, review the retirement age for senior gardaí and make recommendations to the Government on the numerical strength of the force while remaining accountable to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and keeping him or her informed of all its meetings and decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">One of the most important changes a new Garda authority would make would be in respect of the organisational structure of the Garda.  According to a recent report by the Garda inspectorate, the management of the Garda is too top-heavy, with a large number of senior personnel responsible for top-level implementation of policy and change management.  The structure must be changed, streamlined and devolved in order that regional commissioners will have power to take action in their areas and be responsible for the taking of such action.  I accept that the latter is not dissimilar to what the Minister stated earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The Garda Commissioner must take a step back from the day-to-day running of the force so that he or she can concentrate on major issues such as the implementation of reform.  The commissioner's operational responsibilities should be devolved to a deputy commissioner and his or her administrative responsibilities should be also devolved to another deputy commissioner.  I support the approach that provides for the appointment of a deputy commissioner for administration.  All departments that will fall under the remit of such an individual — including human resource management, ICT, finance and health and safety — should be, as far as possible, staffed by civilians, particularly if the relevant expertise is not available within the force.  There also should be a single, civilianised position of director of communications.  The responsibility of the latter would be to act as a spokesperson for the force and to ensure the communication of Garda messages to the press and members of the force is dealt with in a professional manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The suggestions I have made would ensure the comprehensive civilianisation of the force.  A shocking number of fully trained gardaí are carrying out jobs that could and should be done by people with no policing expertise.  A parallel civilianised stream of personnel must be put in place to provide cover in the areas to which I refer.  It is an inexcusable waste of time for gardaí to be sitting in barracks, stamping passports and driving licence application forms and answering telephones.  These jobs should be done by anyone with appropriate administrative skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The Government has been in power for almost a decade and the issue of Garda numbers has been to the fore for most of that period.  Why has civilianisation not yet been implemented to any great extent.  Real civilianisation has a twofold benefit and would allow An Garda Síochána to have the best of both worlds.  There is a substantial store of knowledge and experience in the private sector that could be put to good use in running the Garda Síochána.  If the force fails to embrace civilianisation, a wealth of intelligence will be lost to the State.  Civilianisation would allow the Garda to introduce certain expertise, particularly in the area of administration, in respect of which gardaí might not have the requisite skills, in order that best international practice can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">There is a need to introduce changes in community policing and some of these are dealt with in the relevant legislation.  We must do more, however, to put additional gardaí on the beat and to give communities back to the people, rather allowing them, as is the case at present, to be terrorised by criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I wanted to comment on Garda training and discipline but I cannot do so within the time constraints.  I will say, however, that before we have a truly accountable and disciplined police force, a significant cultural change will have to take place among individual gardaí.  Officers must convince people that the force, as a whole, has their interests at heart at all times and that it is accountable and transparent in its operations.  People should feel safe on the streets and in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I look forward to the contributions of other Members to the debate.  The Garda has served the State well since its foundation.  I accept that there have been difficulties and that problems remain.  However, I am confident the Garda Síochána can rise to the many challenges ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The Minister approached the Garda Commissioner and informed him that he can have any resources he requires to combat gangland crime.  It is not before time that this was done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_306">I welcome the Minister and I compliment him on the various initiatives he has taken in this area.  Since his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was obvious he intended to address any deficiencies within the force and to strengthen and increase the manpower and resources available to it.  He has made significant progress in that regard.  That progress and the changes required are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The reports we are debating paint a sad picture in respect of specific issues but they may also highlight deficiencies that existed.  Mr. Justice Morris probably summed up matters when he stated that he was staggered by the amount of indiscipline and insubordination he found within An Garda Síochána.  Any democrat would be alarmed when an eminent judge makes findings of that nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">It would be remiss of us to continue to focus on the deficiencies and not balance matters by paying tribute to the many fine gardaí who provide selfless service in what is a difficult and dangerous job.  We are indebted to them for, in general, having served the State well in difficult times — in the past and currently in the fight against gangland crime — often at great danger to themselves.  We depend upon them for our individual and collective security and in respect of the security of the State.  We must acknowledge, as Senator Cummins observed, that by any yardstick the force has served us well.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We must recognise that the members of the Garda Síochána are unarmed, which has a number of implications.  I am sure many, if not all, Members and the Minister welcome the fact that the force is unarmed.  In light of threats to the State such as that currently posed by organised crime gangs, this issue should not be treated as a sacred cow.  We should periodically review whether having an unarmed force is appropriate and whether the latter is effective in the context of acting as a deterrent to crime.  I am not advocating that we should change the position.  However, expert analysis is required to evaluate whether changing the policy might make a positive contribution to the fight against crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">All of the reports that are the subject of this debate identified deficiencies.  However, that relating to Donegal highlighted appalling carry-on by particular individuals who reached conclusions as to who should be accused in respect of certain crimes and then fabricating evidence to make a case stand up in court.  Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and intolerable in any democratic society.  The report to which I refer indicates that a lack of training was provided in respect of leadership roles.  In some ways, this matter is being tackled at present but it should really have been dealt with many years ago.  The management and promotional system within the Garda ensured that certain people were appointed to particular positions.  On one occasion Kathleen O'Toole told that good cops did not mean good managers.  They were ineffective and did not have the necessary management skills which even with training they may not have developed.  Aptitude tests should be introduced as well as training.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The Minister quoted Mr. Justice Morris as saying:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_312">The Tribunal feels that it is necessary to point out that no one should serve as superintendent without having the training, the expertise, the commitment to duty and the front line experience that will enable them to make real judgments on matters relating to criminal investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">This should not be limited to superintendent level but apply also to sergeants and inspectors.  Training should be ongoing, not delivered on a one-off basis linked to promotion.  There should be continuous reviews which include a focus on best international practice for tackling sophisticated, serious organised crime gangs with global operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Like Senator Cummins, I sat on the sub-committee on the Barron inquiry and was shocked to see the failure in the police system in response to the events of the 1970s.  This seemed to be endemic.  While one might understand that files were missing after a certain period, the loss of evidence in serious criminal cases, involving mass murder is shocking.  Files were badly prepared, there was very little communication, headquarters and C3 were unaware of information being gathered close to the Border, and leads and people who should have been interviewed were not followed up.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there were significant inefficiencies in the force.  I suspect they have not all been corrected.  Some of the initiatives in the Garda Síochána Bill will, I hope, make significant changes and improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">There should be a random audit of Garda activities, conducted annually across the country in which files are sought to see if cases are being properly documented, if leads are being followed and evidence and everything to do with the files is being retained.  Only with that discipline in the system will we eventually have the type of Garda operation to which we aspire.  The inspectorate can play that role but it needs to be specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Criticism of the Garda is also criticism of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has been in charge of, and connected to, the Garda throughout these episodes.  It is not good enough for the Department to wash its hands of these events, as happened in the 1970s when information was not gathered or recorded, which is incredible.  The Department must examine its own systems.  The inspectorate should use a clear check list of what applies in best police practice in all serious criminal cases and cover this in reports to the Department.  While the Commissioner has a certain autonomy it will not be acceptable for the Department to deny responsibility if something serious goes wrong.  It must be laid at the door of the Department as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">One of these reports was of the first commission of investigation, into the Dean Lyons case.  It was conducted over six months at a cost of approximately €1 million.  When that is compared with the shenanigans — I use the word advisedly — in Dublin Castle it shows that the system for public inquiries needed to be overhauled.  It is unjust to those people whose names have been before those tribunals for between seven and nine years which do not appear to be coming to a conclusion.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  I compliment the Minister on recognising this and taking action on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Apparently these tribunals have cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of euro on exorbitant fees.  The only good thing to come out of this process is the competition report on the legal profession which I hope the Minister will embrace.  He has already taken steps on aspects of the report but I hope he will opt for independent regulation to ensure that the many good recommendations are put into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We should conduct an audit and review of the tribunals.  Any serious issue should be set aside but there is no reason not to transfer some issues to a commission of investigation which could do the work more speedily and at far less cost.  I hope the Minister and the Government will initiate that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Garda inspectorate is the most significant change because it will bring in people with expertise to apply checks and balances to ensure that the force functions to the level we set for it.  Senator Maurice Hayes has contributed to the four person civilian group.  There will be development of management and leadership skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Undercover work by the gardaí is not as prevalent as it should be.  In other jurisdictions the rate of detection of drug-related and organised crime is related to skill at undertaking undercover work.  It is highly dangerous for the individuals involved but seems to be an effective mechanism.  It does not seem to be a major part of the Garda Síochána's fight against criminal gangs.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The Garda Reserve is a good idea as is increasing the force and making available necessary resources.  I have confidence in the local policing committees but it was wrong to allow the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government soften it.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">How sensible is it to have a pilot scheme for bodies that will meet only twice a year?  These issues are urgent and we should roll out the committees because they are effective for accountability and at spreading the message locally.  They can be a good conduit between gardaí and the community and <i>vice versa</i>.  The whistleblowers charter is good, the inspector has already emphasised the need for visibility when the gardaí are on the beat.  Rather than gardaí on traffic duty hiding behind a tree, trying to make themselves invisible, it is better for them to be seen because then motorists are aware that there are checks for traffic control.  On a recent visit to Japan I noticed huts on each corner where the police are highly visible.  The bad news in these reports will result in good being done as deficiencies in the system will be tackled with energy, drive and commitment and the Garda Síochána will be a force of which we and its members can be proud.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I also welcome the Minister.  He has been most generous with his time and he has shown great respect for the Seanad by the way in which he has introduced Bills and made himself available to listen to debates such as this one.  As a Member of this House, I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I wish to refer to a number of matters raised in the Minister's speech before coming to other matters.  The first is his acknowledgment that two detectives deliberately planted a weapon at a Traveller campsite, allegedly with a view to ensuring a search under section 29 would be successful.  That is a really worrying situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Mr. Vincent Browne has done a service to the nation by his dramatisations and inquisitions night after night into these various tribunals, including the one which I believe is properly known as the McBrearty tribunal.  It would only be just for the State to pay for the legal costs of the McBrearty family because, as was made clear on one of these programmes, it is not a level playing field.  Even accused, impugned gardaí who are in a delicate position have massive support from their organisations and, thereby, from the State.  I accept there are some legal technicalities involved but, in fairness, it would be a very good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Senator Jim Walsh referred to whistleblowers.  Thank God he did not get into his stride because I have to attend a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and if he had, I would never get to make my passionate plea for the metro.  Let me say a word about the whistleblowers in these two Houses of the Oireachtas, namely, Senator Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin.  They were the ones who brought this matter to public attention, and they did so in the belief that they were covered by parliamentary privilege.  It appears that was not completely so and they got into a great deal of difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">This House also experienced difficulty in supporting them in terms of their legal costs.  That is dreadful.  I urge the Minister to examine this matter further to see whether there are any imperfections in the matter of parliamentary privilege so that honest and decent Members who do the community a service by whistleblowing are protected.  One of the things we value most is our parliamentary immunity.  It is one of the great safeguards of democracy.  I cannot hear what the Minister is mumbling but I am sure I will find out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_101" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_329">I just wonder how many more sets of costs I will have to pay before Senator Norris is finished.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I commended the Minister's party and ministerial colleague, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, because she was accused by the newspapers of saving money.  I said I thought it was a very good thing and she should not be penalised for it.  Perhaps some of the money the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is saving can be used for this purpose.  The Minister could hardly suggest Deputy Howlin and Senator Jim Higgins did not give the State sterling service.  It is wrong that they were put under such pressure as a result.  The Minister may take a different view.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I know the Minister agrees with me about one matter, although that was not always the case, namely, warrants issued under section 29.  I am sure he will remember when the Bill was going through the House, I was one of those who questioned the role of the police in being allowed to issue warrants.  I suggested this should be a judicial function rather than a function of the police.  I am pleased the Minister stated, as a result of some of these reports, that he is seriously concerned about this operation and is trying to replace section 29 to define as closely as possible the exceptional circumstances in which warrants may be issued by members of the Garda Síochána.  The issuing of warrants by the Garda should be very restricted.  It is worrying that the police should take any judicial function, which it appears to me they are doing by issuing warrants.  I hope the Minister gives the matter close attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I have a high regard for the Garda Síochána.  I have had virtually nothing but good relations with it.  It is a sterling force of which we can, by and large, be proud.  There were a few difficulties in the old days when I was active in the gay community, so to speak.  We knew there were one or two police stations that were really frightful because they had a bee in their bonnet about the issue and they knew they had a soft target.  That is really the only thing about which I can complain.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I urge the Minister to emphasise the role of community policing.  In my area of north inner city Dublin, we had a couple of extraordinarily good, engaging young police officers.  They were terrific.  They got to know the community and made friends there.  Information was passed to them because people liked and respected them.  That is what we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I do not think there is anything peculiar in the air in County Donegal.  Having praised Mr. Vincent Browne I now utter an appeal to him, which I doubt he will hear from here, to lay off now because I am suffering from McBrearty fatigue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_103">

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_336">What I said previously stands, but one can have enough.  It would be incorrect to assume these matters are confined to the County Donegal area.  It is necessary to keep an eye on the situation.  The Minister will be familiar with the old Latin tag, <i> quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>, who will guard the guards themselves?  We need to keep an eye on this to ensure these practices do not spread.  It is a pity that one or two of the detectives involved there appear to be decent people who were led astray.  That is a cause of great concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I am pleased the Minister approved of the Birmingham report, given its comparative rapidity, the surgical skill displayed and the lack of enormous fees associated with it.  As he is in the House, I also commend Senator Maurice Hayes.  He was centrally involved in the Patten report.  The experience he gained there will undoubtedly be of use in terms of what is recommended in the various reports recently made available to the Minister.  There is no doubt the Patten report was a significant one.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I am tired of the constant bickering over Garda numbers.  I urge the political parties to lay off trying to confuse people about numbers.  I have listened to the debate and it appears to me the Minister is approximately correct.  It depends on the snapshot date at which the numbers are taken.  One can argue the toss but that leads both sides into folly.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I know it was, but the Minister has already used the Goebbels analogy so I thought he might like another little smear and Himmler is more suited to Senator Cummins as he has glasses.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">It is most unfortunate that people would play politics with these numbers because they are approximately correct.  It would be fair enough if there was a real problem.  That is partly due to the Garda reserve, etc.  I welcome that fact.  I compliment the Minister, to whom I am not always complimentary, on facing down a mini-revolt in the Garda by sticking to his position.  He said he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that he was introducing this measure which was done democratically and passed by the Oireachtas and all the rest of it, and that was it and eventually it was accepted.  The Minister won.  That was a good day for democracy.  The experience of other police forces, including on the neighbouring island, has shown that while it is not a replacement for the police, a reserve force can help.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I approve of civilianising the police force.  It is idiotic to have qualified policemen and women answering telephones, typing letters and manning computers.  I accept there are times when this is necessary but no garda should be exclusively pinioned into this position.  I welcome the recommendation that a civilian should be appointed at deputy Garda Commissioner level dealing with administration and human resource management.  That is very good and I would like to see as much replacement as possible of gardaí engaged in office work.  I commend those responsible for the report and I commend the Minister because it appears he is going to take the recommendations on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I have here an article which actually approves of this as it states that it allows secretaries, receptionists, analysts, senior crime officers, financial personnel and anything else that is appropriate to be made up of civilians.  It goes on to state that this is one of the most difficult areas to bring about in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I would not be surprised if it was my colleague over there who forged this because he or somebody has come up with the very happy phrase, "Many police officers do not mind being in the comfort and warmth of the barracks rather than out on the streets."  One can understand that and empathise with the human situation, but when faced with the difficulties with which we are faced, I do not think we can take as a major consideration the comfort, the warmth and security of the barracks as opposed to how hot and cold the weather is out on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Both the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, have been involved in the establishment of joint policing committees.  On Monday last I attended my first meeting of the central sub-committee of the joint policing committee in Store Street Garda station, having volunteered to do so.  It was extremely useful.  It was entertaining in some ways to see a representative of Sinn Féin chairing it and sitting next to a chief inspector.  I rather enjoyed that and it shows we have travelled a certain distance.  The matters that come under review are very ordinary and humble matters such as litter, vandalism, anti-social behaviour, public drunkenness and so on.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_348">I hope it will be as flexible as Senator Walsh's minute.  The problem of drunkenness needs to be looked at.  The Minister needs to look at the licensing laws because they are far too vague.  I complained about licensing laws and I got into severe trouble, but the Minister knows every huckster's shop in this town is stuffed to the roof with vodka.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I wish to raise one other matter — I have a flexible minute remaining — and that is the issue of drugs.  Everyone is looking for a solution to the drugs problem.  There is one, but it is a difficult one to take.  The Minister will definitely not agree with me on this, given what he has said so far.  I believe it has got to be tackled at an international level.  It will not be helped by the fact that large countries such as the United States have been clearly involved in massive narcotics trafficking in order to fund the undermining of democratically elected regimes, such as in Nicaragua where the Contras were massively funded by narcotics trafficking in which the Americans were openly involved.  Let us look at the situation in Uzbekistan where the US and Britain turn a blind eye to the enormous narcotics traffic under the aegis of President Karimov.  If international agreement could be obtained it would help to legalise, licence and control it.  This would ensure that crime levels would drop massively, addicts would be less prone to die because they would get a quality controlled substance, life would be better all around and the godfathers would be wiped out because what is driving this is the financial incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">We found a tonne of cannabis in Westmeath or somewhere, but so what?  It simply has not stemmed the tide of drugs; it does not work.  All it does is drive up the cost of drugs and the guns come in because of this.  One has to look at the whole issue of drugs internationally.  With the best will in the world one will never win the alleged war on drugs.  It is as specious as the war on terror.  One has to understand the enemy rather than denounce it and be prepared to take unpopular steps.  There are senior police officers all over Europe who will say exactly the same.  Ireland cannot do it on its own.  These discussions should start now if we are really serious.  We know the practice on the streets already.</p>

I do not want to be accused of insider trading, so I will keep to fairly general points.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome the Morris and Nally reports which are hugely important.  In particular, Judge Morris has given a penetrating analysis in very difficult circumstances.  What the Nally report showed is the difficulty of the interface between what one may call intelligence and ordinary policing.  This will always remain difficult to manage whether one has a policing board or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">While there were things I would rather have seen in the police Act, the Act is what we have and we should work with it and start to build the necessary relationships.  The Minister said the Ombudsman Commission would begin operation in the new year.  It would be helpful to know when in the new year it will commence.  I had thought it might be in operation in late autumn and certainly by the end of the year.  If for whatever reason there has been slippage it is important to get that element into place.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">It is refreshing to see the inspectorate in place.  It is hugely important in benchmarking Garda practice against international best practice.  These are police officers talking to police officers.  When they talk the same language they have a far better chance of making an impact than any of us sitting on the outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I was not totally enchanted with the Barr report, for a couple of reasons.  I thought the purpose of a tribunal was to establish the facts and draw conclusions from them.  I get more worried when they begin to speculate on what would have happened if the facts had been different.  I think that takes a tribunal into rather difficult territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I also think it was unfair to individual gardaí to name them.  The gardaí do not go out to shoot people.  The people who had to do that in these circumstances will carry that with them for the rest of their lives.  It was unfair to pillory them.  However, I am encouraged to know that some of the recommendations have been adopted.  I wonder which ones.  I hope the Garda is not waiting for every tribunal to put the last dot and comma in place.  A key element of the Barr report was to ensure that in every region there were properly trained people capable of dealing with the circumstances and taking control of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The reports on the inspectorate, in which I had an involvement, made two key recommendations.  The first related to regionalisation and devolution, which if achieved would result in a series of groupings leading to real accountability allowing for building up the capacity in the unit by having the people to deal with it.  The other is civilianisation.  I am glad the Minister has accepted that we need somebody at deputy commissioner level.  The sooner that is done the better.  It is important to get that person in and to marshal people under him or her.  It would bring to the organisation skills and an attitude of mind that it badly needs.  The support across the House for civilianisation is evident and the process needs to be accelerated.  I have seen documents that suggest civilianisation could be achieved over a period of 21 years, which is nonsense.  It needs to be done in two or three years.  It is one of the ways to get experienced valuable policemen on the streets where people want to see them in order to be reassured.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">There is a problem, which the Minister may need to take up with the Minister for Finance.  It seems rather more difficult than most people believe it should be to replace a garda with a civilian because of the Civil Service numbers game.  Substitutes need to be found in other places.  In some civilianised jobs there may be a problem of filling round holes with square pegs because there happens to be somebody in the wider Civil Service who might, following a shampoo, become an analyst or something like that, which is a poor approach to the issue.  There seems to be rigidity in this regard.  It may be possible to outsource much of what is done by gardaí to other people, which is what is done in many places.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Further to what Senator Jim Walsh said, we might need to redefine the relationship between the Department and the Garda, given the new responsibility of the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer.  Senator Cummins made a plea that the Commissioner should be left clear to take on the major strategic tasks.  He cannot have everything come up the line to him.  It may be because of pressure coming from this House and the other House that a Minister is expected to know everything that goes on in every Garda station.  We need to steel ourselves to accept it may not be possible and to find other ways of doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">We need to recognise the problem in such organisations is that the position of Garda Commissioner is a lonely one.  He needs some help and support — I am not sure what it is.  He carries very heavy responsibility for the country.  Successive Commissioners have done so with distinction and honour.  What I have to say reflects what the Minister has said.  In any dealings that my colleagues and I have had with the Garda, we have had a very open dialogue and found a ready acceptance of the changes that need to be made.  Following the publication of these reports, there is a public mood and a mood within the Garda for change.  It is important to take advantage of that wind.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Reference was made to training and recruitment.  We need to recognise that those being recruited to the Garda are very different from those recruited a number of years ago.  It is no longer a case of people coming in straight from school.  Many people are joining with university degrees and they need to be motivated and supported.  When everybody is recruited at the same age they move up the ranks at the same time and leave the force at the same time.  It is critical to deal with that problem also.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Without a market for drugs, we would have no sellers.  I recently read a report in a newspaper by one of these chick-lit young lady journalists who claimed that she did not know anybody who did not take cocaine, which is a terrible claim.  Until some of these trendy middle-class people and some people who are in the media appear in court, it will be very hard to preach to people in the inner city about the dangers of drugs.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_366">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate the implications for governance, accountability, discipline and training in the Garda Síochána arising from the findings and conclusions of a number of reports, including the Barr report.  I again sympathise with the Carthy family and the people of Abbeylara following the shooting of John and all they have been through over the past six and a half years since that dreadful day in Abbeylara, which is in the northern part of my native County Longford.  I was travelling to a conference in Tralee when I heard what was unfolding in Abbeylara and it made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The Barr report runs to 744 pages, 16 chapters and several sections, covering: the terms of reference; interpretation; John's background; the events leading up to 19 and 20 April 2000; the final minutes; John Carthy's exit from the family home and the subsequent fatal shooting; eyewitness accounts that have been taken into consideration; the management of the incident in Abbeylara; the aftermath; the post-mortem examination; and the involvement of the media.  It also highlights the role of the emergency response unit in great detail, gives us a greater insight into the structures in the Garda Síochána and last, but by no means least, makes recommendations and gives conclusions and a summary of command failures at Abbeylara on the day and the days leading up to the incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Scene commanders and others made serious errors contributing to the disaster in Abbeylara, including the failure to have John Carthy's doctor interviewed in depth by a competent experienced and fully briefed officer as a matter of urgency early in the first evening and the failure to bring to the scene promptly his psychiatrist to advise the negotiators and commanders.  The report highlights the gap of several hours.  It was also wrong not to have his mother, sisters and other close friends interviewed early as a matter of urgency by competent experienced officers who were properly briefed on the known facts regarding his health, family background and history to ascertain why he told his mother he intended to defend the old homestead against what was happening to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As we all know, the family was due to move into a new local authority house, provided by Longford County Council and the old house was to be demolished.  It was also the tenth anniversary almost to the day of the death of his father, to whom he was very close.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Many other failures are outlined in the report.  In his report, Mr. Justice Barr stated that he was in no doubt that the Garda management of the siege at Abbeylara was defective in many respects and fell far short of what was required to contend with the situation successfully and to minimise the risk to life.  Many of us share Mr. Justice Barr's concern that Mr. Carthy's requests for cigarettes and to speak to a solicitor — simple requests from an ill man — were not met.  There is general disappointment that less lethal options were not deployed by the Garda at the siege.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I have respect for gardaí, who face significant dangers and challenges on a daily basis.  They must confront dangerous criminals who would make light of injuring or killing them, for instance, and must attend dreadful death scenes.  Gardaí are confronted with more violence than most of us ever face.  We should all be grateful and proud that more than 90% of gardaí carry out their duties in a professional manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">At Abbeylara in April 2000, however, John Carthy was shot dead by gardaí in an incompetent siege operation.  It is dreadful to consider the lack of intelligence with which he was treated and the hassle this nervous and vulnerable young man encountered from some gardaí in the months leading up to the siege.  Information regarding the number of times he was taken to the Garda station for questioning emerged only in evidence to the inquiry.  The Barr tribunal, which produced a report of 744 pages and cost the taxpayer more than €18 million, failed to answer important questions such as whether gardaí had an alternative course of action open to them other than shooting John Carthy dead.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I welcome the publication last week of draft regulations for a Garda whistleblowers charter.  As one step on the road to Garda reform, it is welcome.  However, many other recommendations in the Morris report which are necessary to restore full public confidence in the Garda have not been implemented.  Fine Gael has long supported the idea that whistleblowers should enjoy the full protection of the law.  This draft charter will help to foster a more transparent culture within the Garda.  I hope the Minister will sign it into law early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">A whistleblowers charter could have been in place a long time ago if the Government had not voted down Private Members' Bills on this subject because of its stance that only whistleblowers in some sectors merit legal protection.  Much work remains to be done to improve Garda discipline.  Some gardaí have yet to understand that they are not above the law.  Another mechanism that must come into line before we can be confident about Garda discipline is the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  Three commissioners were appointed last February amid a great fanfare but, almost a year later, they have not yet begun their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In view of the Barr report's emphasis on the need for a review of Garda command structures and training, and its emphasis on the lack of working links between the Garda and State psychologists, an urgent review of preventive measures must take place.  The evidence before the Barr tribunal points away from any suggestion of suicidal intention on the part of John Carthy and raises issues that require immediate resolution.  We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy to occur.  We must learn from the mistakes that occurred at Abbeylara and put the measures suggested by Mr. Justice Barr in place immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">These measures include the equipping of the emergency response unit with taser stun guns.  Some funding has been put in place for this equipment but it is insufficient.  In addition, there must be further investigation of other non-lethal options to a shoot-to-kill reaction.  We must prioritise the establishment of a retraining model such as that in Victoria, Australia, which have a high success rate to facilitate and organised restructuring of the Garda response to siege situations.  I acknowledge that some work has been done in this regard but it is vital that there is improved training for Garda recruits and refresher courses for all officers, which should include basic instruction on mental illness.  Consideration must also be given to how many psychologists should be employed by the State to provide expert assistance in siege and other situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">It is increasingly the case that the main beneficiaries of the work of the tribunals are barristers.  In ever repeating cycles, tribunals are rarely completed within the allotted timescale.  The benefits in terms of accountability are lost in the bitter aftertaste left by the final legal bill, which in this case amounts to some €18 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I hope this report will bring some comfort to John's family, who have acted with such admirable restraint and responsibility in the years since his death.  I hope they receive the degree of closure which they have long sought and that the Minister will deal with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Barr immediately rather than procrastinating on the issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the Minister and his officials.  It is greatly to his and his Department's credit, and that of his predecessor, that when serious problems self-evidently arose in the Garda Síochána, they did not attempt to sweep them under the carpet.  They did not try to establish some type of whitewash tribunal that might evade the prospect of appalling vistas and so on.  Instead, they tackled the problem head-on and are applying the lessons learned.  I preface my contribution by observing that I have no sympathy whatsoever with a defeatist approach to the spread of drugs.  That crime will probably last as long as humanity does not mean we must accept it as a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I will focus the rest of my remarks on the Nally report, which I welcome for its clear conclusions.  I have an interest to declare in this in that I was impugned in some of the allegations made by Detective Sergeant White.  These allegations were brought to the attention of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, who issued a report on the matter.  That report was given to the authorities in this jurisdiction, who instigated an inquiry.  While I am a great admirer of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, I regret that credence was given to allegations in a way that has proved to this day deeply upsetting to the families of the Omagh bombing victims.  More attention should have been paid to the motivation of those who sought recourse from the ombudsman's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">After the successful ratification of the Good Friday Agreement in both parts of the island, problems persisted in regard to loyalism and Orange marches and the continued existence of three paramilitary dissident organisations on the republican side.  Discussions were held with the INLA which moved towards a ceasefire.  It had already decided to declare a ceasefire before the Omagh bombing.  I had a meeting, which is on the record, with the political front of the Real IRA, the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, in early July, urging it to declare a ceasefire.  It gave me a document of historical-cum-legal-cum-ideological arguments which was passed to the Attorney General's office.  A reply was sent effectively at the end of July, a fortnight before the Omagh bomb went off, demolishing the case for continued struggle and for acceptance of the validity of the people's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Omagh bomb went off on 15 August 1998.  I was in Donegal, having spoken at the Magill Summer School the previous night.  I heard the news of the bomb at 5.20 p.m. on the radio while in Killybegs.  I went home another way; the natural route would have been by Omagh.  I remember explaining to the Taoiseach late that night that the State faced as large a threat as it had during the Emergency.  Firm action was needed to prevent any repetition of the Omagh bomb and to give confidence, both North and South, in the State's determination to act.  That was very important in the reactions of other people, including loyalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The then Government recalled the Dáil to pass draconian legislation which was to bring such paramilitary activities to an end quickly.  Allegations were made by Detective Sergeant White, presumably on the basis that the best form of defence is attack and with the motive of discouraging the State from pursuing other matters against him by impugning the leadership of the Garda Síochána and a member of the Taoiseach's office.  To suggest in some way or other that Fr. Reid, who had met some of those associated with the Real IRA in Dundalk, was on behalf of the Irish Government offering in exchange for a ceasefire that the Omagh bombers would not be pursued is false.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I spoke with complete frankness to the Nally inquiry.  There is multiple documentary proof to show that at all times the then Government was determined to pursue the Omagh bombers and anyone involved in illegal acts that had occurred before that time.  The only question, in the light of the legislation passed, was whether the State would proceed with a general round-up of everyone associated with the Real IRA, necessary as a preventative measure, to ensure nothing like Omagh occurred again.  Alternatively, would the State focus only on those who had committed crimes?  It was the expectation of and the demand from the Government that the Real IRA would disband at the end of 1998.  Three months after a ceasefire had been called, I met some representatives of the Real IRA, which is on the record.  Unfortunately, no such assurance could be given.  I believe that was a great mistake and an act of folly on the part of those concerned.  It is one reason several dozen people are sitting in Portlaoise Prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is unfortunately the case that at least two dissident republican organisations are not on ceasefire.  I do not wish to exaggerate but I believe they are a source of danger and disability in the process, especially taken in conjunction with those who may be disaffected within the mainstream organisation.  I urge the Government and the authorities to continue to do all in their powers to close down those paramilitary organisations and their military activates.  This remains an important priority.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_386">I commend the work that went into the various tribunal and inspectorate reports and the report by Senator Maurice Hayes and the advisory group on Garda management.  The work was carried out with such attention to detail and each report contains several recommendations against which no one can argue.  The tribunals were examples of those that have worked.  The interim reports allowed recommendations to be implemented as the investigations proceeded.  We know from experience that tribunals take a long time but these tribunals were prompt in coming to their conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The first report of the Morris tribunal contained many important recommendations which allowed them to be implemented quickly.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been criticised, however, on the publication of the later reports. <i>Village</i> magazine asked why the publication of the later reports of the Morris tribunal were delayed until August 2006.  The delay, it argued, gave the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, time to protect his flank against further criticisms of not having acted on previous recommendations.  It continued that he published disciplinary regulations which go some way in implementing the recommendations made two years ago.  I would be interested to hear his views on this criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Republic of Ireland is behind in reforms of its police force.  It is not unique in facing a crisis in its police force.  Many countries, such as the United States, Belgium, Australia, the UK and Northern Ireland, have had to confront the type of issues we face.  The point is how one responds to such crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Labour Party usually offers the Patten commission as a good example of reform.  The Patten commission examined best practice.  Senator Maurice Hayes has brought great expertise to the Republic of Ireland in terms of how we can reform our police service.  He is working with the Minister in that regard.  He was appointed to the advisory group and it has made important recommendations.  He was also involved in the Patten commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">A year or so ago I attended a lecture by Paul Smith, if I remember his name correctly.  He is a QC and was involved in the Patten commission.  He said the commission examined best practice elsewhere and decided that the best practice — this is my interpretation of what he said — is where there is an emphasis on public accountability, community policing and problem solving.  The way the Patten commission recommended achieving those objectives, and how it set about reforming the police force, was through setting up a policing board and local committees, with an emphasis on accountability, working with the community and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The Minister has said previously that Northern Ireland is different and unique.  However, it is not unique.  The reforms that were made in Northern Ireland reflected what the Patten commission decided was best practice throughout the world.  In fact, the commission tried to improve on that and went as far as it could in that regard.  That is the problem for the Minister.  He has brought about reforms but he has not gone the extra mile whereby one could say he has radically shaken up the police force and reformed it.  I welcome the reforms the Minister has made but they do not go far enough.  That is the Labour Party position.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The way the Garda Síochána is managed and organised is still subservient to the old structures, although they are being reformed.  Some aspects of the type of reform introduced in Northern Ireland have been introduced here and that is welcome.  However, one example of how the Minister has not opted for ultimate reform and ultimate public accountability is with regard to the appointment of a Garda authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">With regard to academic analysis of the different approaches to policing, Dr. Barry Vaughan, an academic at the IPA, has examined two theoretical approaches.  One, which still dominates in Ireland, is the managerial notion of policing and seeing citizens as customers.  The second, which places more importance on police-community relations, aims to maximise the input and participation of the local community in the delivery of security and safety.  This model involves far more accountability and public involvement.  Paul Smith said in the lecture to which I referred that the police are the public and the public are the police.  They are not separate entities.  The police are there on the public's behalf to provide law and order, security and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">It is not only Northern Ireland that has established a police authority.  Other countries have established versions of it.  Northern Ireland, in fact, was late in implementing it because it had been introduced in Great Britain in the 1960s.  The system is reflected at local level.  I welcome the Minister's intention to introduce joint policing committees; the sooner he does so, the better.  He should then increase the powers of those committees and make them more capable of doing the will of the public, local public representatives and so forth.  That is the next step to be taken following establishment of the committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The other issue mentioned by members of the Patten commission, as well as in the lecture I attended some time ago in the Royal Academy, is the need to get the police out of cars and onto the streets.  That has been done in other countries.  It is a case of going back to basics.  When I attend meetings about crime in my local community many people, who are now in their 50s, recall that when they were young, they knew the local policeman.  He lived down the road or nearby and people knew him.  The police were visible in the area and people felt safer.  When one makes that argument to policemen they often respond that they cannot do as much if they are walking on the beat and that a car gives them greater mobility and speed.  However, it is something that must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">In America, many of the states have examined this and acknowledged that it has to be done.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has also considered it.  This brings us back to the issue of community policing, a concept I have recommended.  The London Metropolitan Police Service promotes the idea of safer neighbourhoods, where police agree to work with the local community on policing priorities.  An example of this is patrols being arranged according to what the community thinks is required and the areas the community believes should be patrolled.  This has been very successful in London.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">There must be greater emphasis on community policing.  It also allows for greater public accountability and working with the public.  However, it is given token treatment in Ireland.  It is not just about providing a certain number of community policemen, although that is important.  In Clondalkin, the Minister increased the number of community gardaí and then slashed the number last year.  The number has gone down from 16 in 2005 to nine in 2006.  That is according to the Minister's reply to parliamentary questions from my party colleagues in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">There must be a change of approach to policing if the concept of community policing is taken on board.  The police must take account of the priorities of the community in how they do their work and in making plans for patrolling and so forth.  There must be a problem solving approach where one attacks the causes of crime and works at crime prevention instead of reacting to crime.  It has been successful in other countries.  It probably has not been implemented anywhere as extensively as it should be.  In many ways it is something with which police forces in other countries are still coming to grips but it makes sense.  Rather than react to events, the police try to deal with the cause of crime.  One looks at what is causing certain problems in a particular area and one works with the community to solve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In some American states, for example, there are sub-offices in housing estates managed by police officers and people from the community.  People in the local neighbourhood can talk to the police or to people working with them about the problems they are experiencing.  That is the type of approach that should be introduced here.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I recall meeting the head of the Garda Inspectorate, Kathleen O'Toole, a number of years ago when she held the equivalent position in Boston.  I do not remember the exact title she held.  She had done great work there and I believe she is the right person for the job here.  I read her report and what was striking was her comment that there was a perception that the pendulum was in danger of moving too far in the direction of specialisation, to the detriment of core policing operations.  She did not say those specialised operations were not important, but spoke about the need for greater and more effective uniformed police visibility.  That is important in terms of overall reform, not just because the public wants it but because it works.  It goes back to zero tolerance, about which Deputy O'Donoghue spoke when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but which was never implemented.  Many people misunderstood zero tolerance.  In its original formulation it meant going after the small issues, nipping problems in the bud, getting at the causes of crime and problem solving so that matters do not degenerate in a community.  That is the kind of approach we need in Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_401">I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his senior officials, who are familiar to this House.  I thank the Minister for the recognition he gives this House in bringing legislation and being prepared to stay here for the duration of a debate as far as possible given his pressing schedule.  The Ministry of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the most demanding Ministry, and I know that from personal contact with former Ministers in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this serious issue.  We must never lose sight of the sacrifices made by members of the Garda Síochána who have been injured or killed in the line of duty.  In the Garda Representatives Association headquarters and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors there is a roll of honour for those who fell in the course of their work.  I am partly nominated by the GRA, AGSI and the Association of Garda Superintendents, however that has not changed the respect I had for the Garda Síochána before I came to this House.  I come from a law-abiding family whose respect for the Garda is unquestionable.  In the course of its work defending the State and our integrity against an onslaught of a 30-year war across the Border, 32 gardaí have been killed.  I recall the late Garda Dick Fallon, who died on 3 April 1970.  I ask the Minister to make a short statement in the new year to clear the air on that case.  There have been some strange and colourful statements on that episode and although the Minister has briefed members of the family, it would be good to discuss it in the public domain.  In the new year I may put down a question on the Adjournment which may satisfy that.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Other gardaí killed in the course of their work include Inspector Sam Donegan, 8 June 1972, Garda Michael J. Reynolds, 11 September 1975, Garda Jerry McCabe, of whose case we are all aware, 7 June 1996, Garda Patrick G. Reynolds, 20 February 1982, Garda Francis Hand from my area of Kiltoom in south Roscommon, 10 August 1984 and Garda John Morley and Garda Henry Byrne, 7 July 1980.  I was in County Roscommon when Garda Morley and Garda Byrne were shot after a bank robbery in Ballaghaderreen, and they were killed at Shannonscross defending our State.  I know the families of both those young men and they were at enormous loss.  Recruit Garda Gary Sheehan was killed on 16 December 1983 at Ballinamore.  I will not go through the full list of 32, however this is an opportunity to outline to the young people in the Visitors Gallery the sacrifice of our Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">There is no point running away from the Morris tribunal situation.  The ordinary rank and file and the sergeants, inspectors and superintendents would apologise for what has happened.  It is an embarrassment and does not reflect on the high standard and integrity of the Garda Síochána.  Young people have great respect for the Garda and I encourage them to do so because it is an unarmed force.  The murders that have occurred in the past few days are cause for concern and if I were on the beat in those areas of Dublin city without being armed I would be concerned.  Nevertheless, that is our tradition.  A special section of the Garda is armed.  I wish the Minister and the Garda Commissioner well in bringing to justice the people responsible for those dreadful murders.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Abbeylara issue should be separated from the Morris tribunal issue.  I am uncomfortable debating both issues at once because they are separate.  The tragic death at Abbeylara has been dealt with in great detail.  The Government ordered the report and was prepared to have a full investigation.  The Garda was open to full scrutiny and that has been dealt with effectively.  As a percentage of the force the number of gardaí who have erred is small.  The Government will have increased the force to 14,000, an enormous number of people, by the end of this term of Government.  We can compare this with the proportion of people who have erred in the church and the Oireachtas.  We are all made of clay.  We are human and errors occur.  We must balance this error against the day-to-day sacrifices of the gardaí.  They have confronted bank robbers, saved people from the River Liffey and risked their lives for the sake of the public.  That is the message I would like to present.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I compliment the Minister.  The only area on which we disagree is the Garda Reserve.  The jury is out in that regard.  The Minister is having a passing out parade on Friday, which is the fastest in the history of the State that gardaí, albeit reserve gardaí, have been put on the streets.  We will agree to differ.  The Government made up its mind to implement it and we will see how it works out.  They are courageous young people to make themselves available to go on the beat without arms in these troubled times.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is due to commence operations in the new year, is a major breakthrough.  People have been talking about this for years, but since Deputy McDowell became Minister these initiatives are being implemented.  Other initiatives include the establishment of the Garda Inspectorate under its chief inspector Kathleen O'Toole and her two fellow inspectors, the appointment of the four-person civilian expert group and the establishment of the local police committee, which was significant.  People have not recognised the Minster's work in these areas.  When it went through Committee Stage the Minister gave limited privilege to those committees, which is unheard of in this Legislature.  No other councils have limited privilege.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I probably will not be here for the Minister's summing up as I have to be back for the Bill at 5 p.m. I hope the Minister will roll out all these committees throughout the country from January 2007.  Councillors are willing and able to advise and assist the Garda locally and this is a great breakthrough.  Those meetings would be held privately and attended by a chief superintendent or an inspector.  The councillors, representing the people, would be able to point out areas of difficulty and the worries on the influx of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Drugs are the biggest single issue.  All the murders in Dublin are linked to drugs and territorial wars.  The drugs are coming in from South America, Africa and the Far East.  Whatever funds the Minister can put into stopping the scourge of drugs will be well invested.  No penalty is severe enough for those who destroy the lives of individuals through drugs.  To get a person on the slippery slope is murder.  I am a former chairman of the national drugs advisory committee.  I am concerned about these small airports, which will have to be carefully watched.  It is also possible to drop cannabis from a small aeroplane without landing, for example onto a bog at night with guiding lights.  Certain elements are now involved in that trade.  Policing committees will help because people have local knowledge and can offer advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I wish the Minister a happy Christmas and every success next year.  I hope his party will be in Government with Fianna Fáil after the next election.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as leader of the Progressive Democrats and Tánaiste.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  He is here so often his wife must wonder if he has a girlfriend in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">It is a great surprise when one turns on electricity or a tap and no electricity or water is provided.  We have grown used to electricity and water always being available.  We have also become accustomed to picking up the phone and a garda arriving.  The confidence that they will arrive and do the job is something so valuable that it is worthwhile having this debate and hearing the Minister's response.  The steps he is taking must ensure this confidence continues and that we will get reliable help when it is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The key word in today's debate on governance, accountability, discipline and training in the Garda Síochána is "implications".  We must consider the implications of what has happened and what action we must take to put things right.  As legislators we had to take into account the findings of recent reports into disturbing aspects of policing in parts of this State.  Having listened to the debate, there are more reports of which I had not been aware.  All accept that change is necessary, including members of the Garda Síochána.  We now have a Garda Inspectorate, an advisory group on Garda management, a Garda Ombudsman Commission, a new Garda disciplinary code and the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  It is our fervent wish that these measures will enhance development and management of the Garda Síochána to make it a more efficient and effective police service.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Although we seek and expect radical change, in some ways what we want is not change but a reversion to the way things used to be.  My hope is that the changes will bring about the situation that obtained in this country for many years, where people trusted the Garda Síochána to protect them and the members of the Garda Síochána relied heavily on the unquestioned community support they received as a matter of course.  Members of the criminal fraternity respected and feared the impact of the Garda and the people working together against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Unfortunately, such a situation has not obtained in this country in recent times.  Although the world has moved on in many ways and the challenges of today are more complicated than they used to be, it is possible to restore the situation to the one most of us happily remember through this raft of reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">My business career in Dublin began in Finglas in 1965.  For many years hardly a day passed when I did not visit Finglas and in the past few years hardly a week passed without visiting Finglas.  There is now a sense of nervousness in Finglas and Kilkenny.  That is the present situation but we seek to return to the confidence of the past.  This will only happen if we are clear about what we seek to achieve.  We should not concentrate on the mistakes of the past, other than to determine that they will never happen again.  Rather than focusing on the nuts and bolts of the new reforms, we should put all our effort into the task of rebuilding the trust between the people and the Garda Síochána.  We can make a contribution in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">No matter how well motivated or organised, the Garda Síochána cannot do its job properly if it is always looking over its shoulder at a hostile public.  The force needs us to trust it to do its job in the current situation.  Some members of the force feel they are under attack and on the defensive.  The terrible events of the past years have given many people good reason not to trust the Garda Síochána.  I do not seek to minimise the impact of that but I urge everyone to look beyond those events to the future that we want.  We cannot reach that future without a conscious rebuilding of trust on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Do these policemen and policewomen believe they have the support and backing of the Oireachtas, the Government and Garda management?  Are members of the Garda Síochána avoiding confrontational situations in the belief that if one does not get involved one will not get into trouble?  That has happened in the past in other areas.  Gardaí may turn a blind eye rather than run the risk of getting into trouble.  If circumstances such as this were to prevail the winners would be the law breakers and the losers would be law-abiding citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">As legislators we must balance governance and accountability with performance and effectiveness, with each complementing the other.  The Minister has taken this into account and his objective is likely to be achieved.  He needs our support in order to reach that objective.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I thank Members for their contributions.  Senator Tuffy asked why the Morris report was delayed.  Under the Act that permitted the three modules I was under obligation to seek the instruction of the High Court to ensure the report did not interfere with Sergeant White's trial.  When I received the report I applied for this direction and was told to await the completion of the trial.  The trial finished after the Dáil had risen so I could not bring the reports before the House until the autumn session.  This was a matter of law and out of my hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">When this session began I sought to bring the reports before the Houses but a number of key Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann were involved in the committee investigating Mr. Brian Curtin.  They asked me to delay the debate to allow them to be present and participate in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Civilianisation is of major importance.  I accept the point made by Senator Maurice Hayes regarding outsourcing.  Support for administrative tasks can be made available to the Garda Síochána.  It is not a matter of producing yellow pack people and filling desks.  People and skills must be matched to civilian support staff.  We must seek people suitable to administrative positions.  In other areas the entire activity can be outsourced.  There is no reason why a garda should stamp passport application forms or deal with shotgun licences when a core administrative staff could deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">There is great scope for civilianising the force.  To use Senator Hayes's phrase, the wind of change is at my back.  The time has come to set out an ambitious programme for accelerated civilianisation.  A 21-week cycle would be preferable to a 21-year cycle although that might be too ambitious.  It was suggested that people like the cushy numbers but most members of the force, particularly younger members, wish to have policing tasks.  They want to tell their families they are policing the country, not sitting in an office administering backroom operations of the policing function.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The role of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was mentioned, a very important point.  I do not believe the Department has had the happiest of roles in its relationship with An Garda Síochána.  There was a time when Peter Berry was the archetypal Secretary General of the Department of Justice and he had a completely hands-on approach.  Nothing happened in the depot without his knowledge, every file of importance was reported to him and there were situation reports flooding in to him from around the country every day.  He gave direction as to what was to happen and the Commissioner was in a very subordinate role, with the Department in the driving seat.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The pendulum swung completely the opposite way.  When I was appointed Attorney General and the Donegal business came into sharp focus, I as the law officer of the State conducted the civil proceedings on the State's behalf and received complaints in that capacity from people who turned out to be victims of action by the Garda Síochána.  Both my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I were told we did not as a right have access to reports because the view was taken at that stage, curiously, that the Garda were in privity with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and it is was effectively a matter of grace and favour to us as to what we would be told about the progress of investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The foot was put down on the part of myself and the Minister in order to restore the balance and indicate that the Minister was accountable to Dáil Éireann, with the Attorney General being the law officer of the State charged with defending these civil proceedings.  We were entitled to know each and every bit as much as the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It was not a matter of seeking the permission of that office to see an investigative file.  The balance had to be restored to that point, and it is an accountability mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">There is also a question of engagement.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has its own internal revolution to undertake to ensure it has appropriate monitoring mechanisms so ministerial accountability can be real rather than something at a distance or semi-detached.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Another point I wish to make deserves a bit of time and I ask the House to bear with me on it.  There have been demands that the daily control of the Garda Síochána should be transferred to a so-called police or Garda authority.  This proposal has been canvassed on and off for many years and in the context of the preparation and development of the Garda Síochána Bill I indicated to the House that I gave very close thought and examination to the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The comparison normally made is that such a board exists in Northern Ireland, and as Senator Tuffy stated, it represents best practice.  I have made my view on this issue clear in the Oireachtas on a number of occasions, including the debate on the Garda Síochána Bill and most recently in my statement to the Dáil on Garda accountability on 29 November.  I take this opportunity to put my views on the issue on record.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I will first consider why Northern Ireland has chosen to go the route of a policing board rather than have direct political accountability for the police as we have in this jurisdiction.  Through most of its history, Northern Ireland had a police service — the RUC — which was perceived by many as being under the directorship of the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs and former Unionist administrations.  After direct rule was introduced, the police were answerable to the Secretary of State, a politician not directly elected by the people of Northern Ireland.  Although there was political accountability in one sense, it was not to a politician from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Following the report of the Patten commission, the policing board existing in Northern Ireland is intended to make policing function accountable.  The Patten commission recommended a majority of members of the board be from the Northern Ireland Assembly.  This is a point not mentioned in any analysis I hear south of the Border.  Ten of the 19 members are members of the Assembly chosen on d'Hondt principles from across the parties and without ministerial involvement.  The system currently deliberately seeks to avoid the police being accountable to a Member of the Assembly from one political party, reflecting the concerns which spring from the historical experience of partisan policing in a divided society.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">When people speak of a policing authority in this jurisdiction, do they want a case where, on a d'Hondt principle, Dáil Éireann will be represented on a policing authority, or do they want the great and the good to be selected by some other process, with an apolitical policing board put in place?  People use the phrase "independent policing board" but from whom is it independent?  The policing board is not independent of the political parties in Northern Ireland, it is directly representative of these parties.  We should bear that point in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The case in the United Kingdom is often quoted in support of the concept of a police authority, but that system should again be viewed in the context of the policing service it oversees.  The UK has a regional police structure, with 43 police forces in England and Wales, as well as eight in Scotland.  There are plans to reduce that number.  It would not be possible for the British Home Secretary or the Parliament in Westminster to oversee all those forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">There is no regional political structure to which they could be held accountable.  There are political appointees such as local authority members who serve on the various policing boards in the United Kingdom, covering the regional constabularies.  For example, the Metropolitan Police Service in London is not responsible to the city's mayor, Ken Livingstone, but the Home Secretary.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I wish to put on record that a police authority is not found in the vast majority of Western democracies.  Where police are organised at a national level they are normally accountable to a Minister of central Government.  This applies in the USA with the FBI, in Canada with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and most European countries.  Reference was made to a former mayor of New York, Mr. Giuliani, and that city's police department reports to the mayor, who is the head of the executive of the city.  The reason this is so is that policing is one of the most fundamental activities of organised society.  People in other jurisdictions must share my view that police should be directly accountable to the democratically elected representatives of the communities they serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">We have one national police force in this country, which is part of the Executive arm of the State and which is answerable, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should make the point that the issues of management and accountability are evident here.  I hope I have common ground with Senator Cummins in that I have no problem with the notion of changing the way in which the Garda Síochána is managed so there is a board in the force, on which lay people sit, which is the board of management of the Garda Síochána.  We are moving in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I would have a major problem if we set up a body equivalent to the Health Service Executive, which would lie between the Minister and the Garda Síochána, with the Garda serving two masters.  One group could then announce policies, priorities and what is being done, with the Minister finding out what was happening in the force by accident or on a semi-detached basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_439">I counsel Members of this House to go down the first route of considering management of the force, with which I have no problem, being done by a board meeting weekly and getting on with its task of collective responsibility.  I have a real problem with a body modelled on the HSE running the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The Garda Síochána operates as the security service of the State and it could not be the case that a Government, in any democracy, could say its security function is carried out by a group of people over whom it had no day to day control, accountability or chain of command.  It would be total folly and completely wrong to vest control of the security service in a body independent of the executive arm of State.  No society I know of has ever attempted to do that and I have never heard anyone suggest such a step would make sense.  I have noticed how often that issue is side-stepped.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I will say as often as necessary that I favour a management board system for the Garda Síochána.  It should not be a pyramid which ends up with the lonely person described by Senator Maurice Hayes, the Commissioner.  He is in a lonely position where two pyramids intersect, one of which he is atop and the other at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Managing a serious organisation of 14,000 or 15,000 people plus civilian staff requires a different system of governance.  I have no problem with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I have a problem with creating a Health Service Executive-type situation.  In the other House and frequently in this House, pandemonium ensues every time my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, must state, "This is a decision for the HSE."  If I were to divest my role and that of these Houses on policing to a body nominally independent of us, such as the HSE, equal pandemonium would ensue.  People use the phrase, "an independent police authority".  Of whom is it independent?  Is it of these Houses?  I do not accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The Garda Síochána manages our border control system.  As Minister for the interior in European terms, I must be in direct contact with and have direct control of those who manage entry to and exit from Ireland.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau must be directly amenable to me.  I could not have a situation where a group of other people made policy decisions or significant decisions with policy implications when I am responsible for that area on behalf of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Just as governance issues arise in the dealings of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the Garda Síochána, they also arise in the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The time has come for the establishment of a joint committee of the Oireachtas on policing and security.  I spoke to the Taoiseach about this.  We do not need to wait for a general election.  We can establish it now and have a committee to which the Commissioner is regularly accountable under the new Act.  It will go a long way to producing genuine democratic oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Oireachtas is the policing authority for Ireland.  It would be a sad day if I were able to state in the Dáil or in this House that I could not answer a question or explain a situation because a group of eight or ten people independent of my office made a decision and I could do nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">A constant barrage of people argue for the proposition that the Executive should divest itself of responsibilities.  This is not the constitutional framework the people voted for in 1937.  The powers of Government exist and the executive powers of the State are supposed to be executed by people answerable to the Oireachtas, particularly Dáil Éireann.  That is the way it is.  I ask this House, especially Senator Cummins, to seek common ground with me on the question of a board of management but not a HSE-type solution.</p>

Senator Leyden has picked up some up of what we have suggested in his own amendment, No. 5.  Amendment No. 12 also aims to tidy up matters and insert something that needs to be included in the wording.  I do not think there is much more I can say about it.  Amendment No. 13 relates to the name and address of custodian of any copy of a will.  We are simply inserting things that need to be inserted.  Amendment No. 14 proposes to delete lines 10 and 11 on page 11 because they are not required.</p>

People are constantly travelling and it would be no harm for them to at least have the facility whereby if they make their will abroad, they have the option to record it centrally in Ireland because they may well return to Ireland or, more than likely, will have family living in Ireland.  This amendment gives them the option to do so if they wish.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">We looked at this very carefully.  The basic principle of the Bill is to have a central registration system confined to the State alone, not outside the State or having any implications outside it.  The Bill came about because, at present, there are 2,200 registration systems in Ireland — that is, 2,200 solicitors' offices — but no central registration system.  As far as matters relating to what happens outside the State are concerned, we could not contemplate taking action at this point.  However, I note the Senator's point.  I thank him for putting a great deal of thought into the amendment but I regret I cannot accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I accept what Senator Leyden is saying.  It would be easier to enact the Bill and then amend the position at a later date.  When the scheme is up an running and, I hope, proves to be a great success, I hope it will be extended.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs recently made changes to the free travel scheme in order that it might apply to those who have been living abroad for many years and who have returned to Ireland.  There is, therefore, a precedent of a sort.  I accept, however, that we should learn to walk before we run.  In that context, we should resolve the situation domestically in the first instance.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_474">The first part of the Senator's amendment simply states that "Nothing in this Act shall be used to disqualify, prevent, or otherwise impede an Irish citizen who is resident outside the State, from registering his or her will".  That is the case under the legislation in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The second part of the amendment seems to be drafted under a misapprehension.  If one executes a will in another jurisdiction, it is not a will for the purposes of Irish law but is rather a will for the purposes of the law of the jurisdiction to which it refers.  Different jurisdictions have entirely different testamentary arrangements.  Some jurisdictions have systems of full registration of wills.  Under such systems and in order to be valid, a will must be recorded in a central register.  Senator Leyden is not proposing that this should be the case in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I am commenting only on the detail of this matter.  I do not believe the amendment would be viable in the context of the Bill because it is not clear under the principles of private international law that an Irish citizen can choose a jurisdiction in which a will can be executed.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">This is not my Bill.  The Bill is being promoted by Senator Leyden and it is not incumbent on me to provide interpretations in respect of it.  Where the Senator uses the word "will" in the first part of his amendment, it clearly means a will in accordance with Irish law.  That is how it will be construed.  A will is identified as being such under the Succession Act 1965, as amended.  There is nothing in the Bill to stop an Irish person abroad who has executed a valid will in Ireland under the Succession Act from registering it.  To that extent, the first part of the amendment is superfluous.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The second part of the amendment seems to envisage a will being executed by an Irish citizen abroad under the laws of another country.  It could be dangerous for such a will to be registered because it falls to be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which it is executed.</p>

However, it might be worth spelling out this in the Bill.  As much as anything, this could be done to reassure people who will use the system.  It must be made clear that this is a voluntary system and that it is designed to allow people to find or locate a will.  It will be better than the existing system but will not supersede it.  Even though a person might use the new system, he or she might be obliged to engage in searches and contact solicitors to ensure another will, which went unregistered, was not made.  It might not do any harm to include in the Bill the wording proposed in the amendment in order that people will be clear what is involved.

          <p eId="para_490">We are all new to this procedure, in respect of which there is no precedent.  I am glad the Minister of State and the Registrar General are present because it creates an awareness that there is no register of wills.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The first matter I should clarify is that wills will not be deposited at a central location.  There is no possibility that the contents of wills will be disclosed to outside parties.  The existence of a will will arise when the person who made it dies and his or her death is registered at the Central Registry Office in Roscommon or Dublin.  TheRegistrar General's office is located in Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">As Senator Tuffy, who is a solicitor by trade, is aware, when it is published, the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> contains numerous advertisement seeking information on the existence of particular wills.  At present, solicitors are obliged to search throughout the State for wills.  People’s mobility is making it more difficult to carry out such searches.  In the past, a local solicitor would, when a person died, contact the members of the family and inform them that a will had been made.  I have come across numerous cases where a will could not be found.  That is the greatest difficulty people encounter.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Disclosure of the details of a will will not arise.  Only a person with a valid death certificate can request information in respect of whether a will was made.  If the Bill is passed, it will not be possible to release such information before the person who makes a will has died.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Since the Bill was introduced, I have discovered that many solicitors would be delighted if a central register of wills was established.  I acknowledge that Senator Tuffy is trying to improve the Bill and I have no reservations about accepting amendments.  In this instance, however, the amendment is not necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">This amendment provides that the register of wills shall not be used by a court to construe or interpret any wills.

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_509">Amendment No. 10 is important because the gist of it is that we cannot presume from the registration of a will or otherwise under this system that it is the only will or that the will still exists, as set out in the various subsections to the new section.  It is important for that to be clear.  While Senator Leyden's Bill is welcome, problems surround it.  Senator Leyden said he had received correspondence from the Law Society to the effect that it opposed the Bill.  If so, it does that with serious intentions.  This amendment is an attempt to address the society's concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The Bill is a good idea, which I hope will be implemented but we should not overestimate the number of people who will register their wills.  Many do not make wills for superstitious reasons.  As a solicitor I dealt with many people who did not make wills until they were older or, in the case of a couple, when they bought a house and had children.  Even in those circumstances, however, many do not make wills.  I tell people it is not the end of the world not to have a will.</p>

Many issues arise.</p>

I am not particularly concerned by its views because I receive information from solicitors in my area who advised me on the Bill and were very helpful.  This amendment makes clear that the registration of a will does not provide any presumption, evidence or proof of the existence, validity, execution, publication, revival or republication of any will.  It also provides that the registration of particulars in the register does not provide any presumption, evidence or proof of these contents.  This is well covered because I received good advice.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_164" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_522">I wish to outline the views of the Government on the Bill because this seems an appropriate place to do so.  Senator Leyden has made a valiant attempt in this amendment to make clear that the register will not provide any presumption about the existence or non-existence of a will or the validity or non-validity of a will.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The amendment states "The registration or non-registration of any wills, including codicils pursuant to this Act shall not be evidence of and shall not provide any presumption of" any of the particulars entered into the register of wills specified in the schedule.  Under this amendment no presumption attaches to any of the particulars registered with the Registrar General.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Government has reservations about this legislation which are somewhat similar to that outlined by Senator Tuffy.  There is a lack of any evidential basis in the register such as in the register of deaths where the evidential basis is established by the fact that a medical practitioner or coroner must provide a certificate and the register must be signed by a relative of the deceased.  In general when births, marriages and deaths are registered they are based on the supply of information by a person authorised to give that information to the registrar and Parliament has generally provided that a presumption attaches to the document evidencing the facts of registration, that the facts are as stated in the particulars.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">No such presumption attaches to this register.  That would be the case whether the Seanad agreed to this amendment or not because the Bill does not attempt to regulate the general law on wills.  For that reason, the registration does not provide an assurance that a will is valid or the last will of a person has been revoked, amended or superseded.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Senator Leyden makes that clear in his amendment but the reality for the general register is that the registers maintained by the General Register Office enjoy a presumption of accuracy and reliability.  The creditworthiness of the register would be somewhat undermined when those who had registered their wills realised that no reliability can attach to the registration.  That is the Department's position on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The Bill raises an important issue of principle and I welcome the fact that Senator Leyden has introduced it.  I know that it commended itself to Senators on Second Stage and that the Seanad has approved the Bill.  It raises important questions and seeks to address the mischief of the disappeared will.  In some jurisdictions there is provision for a central register of wills much as we have a central register of land transactions, such that if one wants a valid will one must register it in a central location.  That has not been the tradition of our law which has always allowed a testator to make his or her will as he or shepleases.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">There is a half-way house solution which could be proposed, namely, that there should be a central depository of wills and that once a will is executed, it would be deposited there.  Again, that would be a matter for legislation amending the Succession Act and would require the assistance of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I speak to this Bill which purports to amend the legislation relating to births, marriages and deaths.  I simply state the views of the Government on the narrow issue of whether it is appropriate to amend that legislation for this purpose.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_529">The reason for no presumption or evidential basis is so that the law of succession is not amended.  The purpose of registration is so that mislaid wills may be found.  The register is meant to be an aid to finding mislaid wills.  That is the fundamental issue.  A Council of Europe recommendation exists in this regard but it has not been ratified by the State.  It promoted the idea of a Europe-wide registration system.  Few countries have registration systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I am most grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the General Register Office for their views in this regard.  They have a responsibility and expertise in this area.  I suggested the Probate Office as a possible vehicle for the registration system.  The Land Registry is another possible vehicle for a registration system.  I am concerned about the overall principle.  The filing arrangements are matters that can be decided should the Bill reach Dáil Éireann.  I am open to re-examining the location of such a depository.  I was initially attracted to the Probate Office being the location, although not all Bills are probated.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The public's attention has been drawn to the need for wills.  I thank Senator Kitt for his suggestion re a wills week.  I must confess that I have not made a will.  The reason I have not done so is that there is no central register——</p>

          <p eId="para_537">I read a very good article in a magazine this week.  I very much appreciate the expertise of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a senior counsel, and the General Register Office in this regard.  I considered all the aspects of the matter.  I was attracted to the idea of the General Register Office as the location because it is located in my constituency in Roscommon town, but the Land Registry has also been relocated to County Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is capable of accommodating this measure.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, examined the proposed legislation and was impressed by it as well.  I am grateful the Government considered the Bill at all.  At this stage we have alerted the public to the need to make a will.  The savings attached to having a will are significant in so far as death duties are concerned.  I accept the Minister of State's point.  I have taken his advice on board in bringing this amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">We do not know how many people will register, should the Bill be enacted.  The Minister of State said he would consider setting up a register for guardianship agreements.  Such a register exists in Scotland and hardly anyone registered those agreements.  Registration systems can be problematic in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I referred to the superstition people have regarding wills.  Part of it is that they do not want to tempt fate.  People may have even greater reservations about registering their wills.  I consider it a positive measure but one should not overstate how successful it may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Even if people do not have wills, they are covered by the Succession Act.  Provisions are made for spouses and children in the disposal of estates.  Many people may not be aware of this fact.  This information should be made more widely known.  People tend to think it is terrible if wills have not been made but it is not as straightforward as that.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">In outlining the position of the Government on the Bill, I should have said the Government considered the Bill on its own merits.  No representations were received from the Law Society in regard to it.  I understand Senator Leyden has been in correspondence with the Law Society about this measure.  He is correct that the Law Society should not have a conclusive view on legislation of this type.  I accept we must act in the public interest and do what is best in that regard.  The concern of the Government is that the well-established reliability which attaches to the documentation issued by the General Register Office could be undermined were we to legislate that wills would be registered there without any assurance of their validity or contents.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_547">(1) by the insertion of the following after subsection (1):</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_548">(1A)(<i>a</i>) All fines under subsection (1) shall be index-linked to the annual inflation rate as set by the European Central Bank, and such fines shall be altered accordingly on the 1st of January each year, beginning with the 1st of January on the second year after the signature of this Act.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_549">(<i>b</i>) In this section, “European Central Bank” means the organisation established by article 8 of the consolidated (2002) version of the EC Treaty.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_550">(2) in subsection (2) by the insertion of "(4A)," between "(4)," and "(5)".".</p>
          <p eId="para_551">This is a repeat amendment which the Fine Gael Party has long been pushing.  Its purpose is to index-link fines.  Unfortunately, the clock is ticking for all of us and things rapidly go out of date.  The Government appears to have a problem with this notion.  It took a year for this Bill to advance from Second Stage.  I am not sure how long it will take for the Bill to come before the Dáil and be enacted but, more than likely, two years will have elapsed before the legislation is up and running.  Accordingly, the provisions will be at least two years out of date from the original publication of the Bill.  It makes sense for fines to be index-linked so that they have some bearing on reality.  Recently, we witnessed the crazy scenario whereby the legislation governing fireworks dated back to 1845 and the maximum fine for having a firework was £5.  That shows how ludicrous the situation can become.  To prevent this situation recurring, the Fine Gael Party intends proposing this amendment to all Bills going through this House.  It may not be for Senator Leyden to answer this point but the Government should take it into consideration on all Bills.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">The Bill relates to the registration of wills.  The main body of legislation deals with fining and any changes to the system of fining should be left to the Minister.  I agree with the overall principle outlined by Senator Browne.  I support the index-linking of fines in any legislation the Minister intends to bring forward.  The principle is a good one and avoids the need to amend legislation purely for that purpose.  I commend Senator Browne's recommendation to the Minister of State but it cannot apply in this regard because we cannot introduce a money Bill in Private Member's time.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I thank the Minister of State for attending this session.  We have created a precedent.  I express my thanks to the Leader, Senator O'Rourke, who encourages Members to use a function, which is open to Members of both Houses but is especially active in this House, to bring in legislation.  Successful legislation has been tabled in this House.  Members will recall the Suicide Bill tabled by the then Senator Dan Neville.  Other Bills have been acted upon by the Government.  The then Senator Mary Robinson tabled Bills as well as other Members, including Senator Norris, Senator Browne and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">It is unusual that I, as a member of the Front Bench of the Government side, was given permission to publish a Bill and have it passed in this House.  This is an historic occasion.  This Bill will alert people to the need to make a will and solicitors to be careful about where they store it and that executors should be informed.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">That latter issue does not require legislation.  A person should be informed immediately by the solicitor that he or she has been appointed an executor of a will rather than informing him or her in the future.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which I will draw to the attention of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and expressing his point of view.  I also thank the Registrar General, Mr. Kieran Feely, for his assistance.  Nothing the Minister of State said is against the principle of the registration system.  The kernel of any reservations the Government may have is where the registration system would be located.  I take that point on board.  I express my thanks to Senator Browne and Senator Tuffy for their contributions and for tabling amendments which we considered.  I should say to Senator Tuffy that were it not for time constraints, I would have accepted some of her amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">We have been given the opportunity to introduce Bills and I have availed of that opportunity.  As a Minister of State I used to come to the Seanad regularly and brought much legislation through the House.  I remember particularly debates with the then Senator Mary Robinson.  This is the first opportunity I have had to bring a Bill to the House and I thank Members for their unanimous backing for it.  I thank the Fianna Fáil Senators who gave me the authority to print the Bill and the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party which approved it last year.</p>

I say, "Well done", to Senator Leyden.  Any Deputy or Senator has the right to table a Private Members' Bill and this is what he has done.  That certainly marks a milestone for which we applaud him and thank those who helped him.  With the most worthy of motives, Ministers of the highest and lowest level bring forward legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Often the language in the Bills is complex and not understood by ordinary folk.  However, people understand matters such as wills because they are of everyday interest.  The lesson in this for legislators is that if they want to engage with the public, they must ensure the legislation is understandable, simple and appealing to the people.</p>

That the Senator has exercised his right to produce a Private Members' Bill is an inspiration for the rest of us.  If the working group on pre-nuptial agreements has its report ready by 31 March  and the House is still in session, I hope to table a Private Members' Bill on pre-nuptial agreements which is somewhat related to the Succession Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">I hope I get as honest a backing as I gave to this Bill.  It is important to acknowledge the role Senator Leyden and the Leader have played in facilitating this important Bill.  It is important from three points of view.  First, people are wealthier and have assets they would not have had in the past and, second, people are more mobile and on average move every 11 years.  There is potential for wills to get mislaid.  A third reason is that people live longer and can outlive their solicitor and that can cause problems.  The three goods reasons for the Bill centre around wealth, mobility and longevity.  It is great to see Senator Leyden following in the footsteps of former Deputy Alan Shatter who led the way in family law matters by having Private Members' Bills accepted in the Dáil.  That is the way it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I contend that the Succession Act is out of date in the context of the increased affluence in the country and the economic and social changes, an issue I will highlight in my pre-nuptial agreements Bill which is similar to the Bill in terms of the background.  I was not aware the Minister of State's father was involved in that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">People should make a will.  I know of two people who died as a result of no will being made.  The father died intestate.  There was a division in the family.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_567">One member of the family decided to sell the farm and another member did not react well.  When the land was purchased by a third party, he was shot dead.  His brother escaped with his life by a whisker.  The person who carried out the shooting then committed suicide.  That is the stark reality of not making a will.  Everyone owes it to his or her family to make a will.  There should be no ambiguity about this.  Everyone should make a will.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Dealing with a death, especially a sudden death, is traumatic and the last thing a family needs is to be torn asunder afterwards, as has happened in a village in Kilkenny where a pub is closed.  The reason it is closed is that the deceased died without making a will and there is chaos with nephews and nieces fighting over it.  That should not happen but it does.  People should make a will.  I would go so far as to say it should be mandatory.  As soon as one owns any kind of property or reaches a certain age, one should make a will.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I urge the Minister of State to ensure this Bill is put through the other House quickly in the new term and is enacted without delay.  I hope those who have wills made can record them retrospectively in the central register because it makes great sense.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_571">I disagree slightly with Senator Browne on the point he has made about wills.  I made the point earlier.  There is nothing wrong with not making a will.  There are advantages to making a will.  As a result of the reforming legislation brought in by the late Brian Lenihan, one is provided for fairly even when there is no will.  It is important to say that.  When a will is made there are huge advantages for the testator to control what happens and it reduces the procedures and the costs.  There is nothing wrong in not making a will.  There can be as many problems in families after a will has been drawn up.  There can be family differences in the same way as if no will was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">That said, the legislation is a good idea.  It is an issue that affects people's lives as reflected in the support for Senator Leyden when he had the initial idea.  The calls to radio stations reflected a huge interest because the matter is obviously an issue of concern.  The principle is good and the question is how to implement it.  Senator Leyden has shown that we should bring forward legislation.  We do a great deal of work on legislation by amending Bills and so on but none of that is recognised by the media and the public at large.  I commend Senator Leyden on the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_573">I am pleased to support the Bill, as the Government spokesperson on health and children, and I commend Senator Leyden on his initiative.  As I said on Second Stage, I have a clear reason for supporting it because in a certain section of the family, where there is a large farm, the owner died intestate.  By the time the land was eventually sold, it was very much in debt because the family could not agree who should have it.  One section of the family wanted to sign away its share to the eldest son who had no interest <i>per se</i> in agriculture.  There was a spinster sister and bachelor brother at home who also could not agree.  By the time the property was disposed of, the head was not worth the washing.  There were only hundreds of pounds left because it ran into debt and was subject to compound interest.  While it is fine to claim that the Succession Act provides in the event of a will not being made, nevertheless the case has been well made by the practical experience of people, not alone in this House but also outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Minister of State has a well-trained and adept legal mind, as has Senator Tuffy.  They both have first-hand experience of what it means not to have made a will.  It makes sense to do so.  I am delighted this House has again shown itself to be progressive and innovative in proposing legislation.  It will be incumbent on us all to use our membership of the House to introduce legislation when its absence impacts adversely on the communities we all serve.  I again congratulate Senator Leyden and all sides of the House that have supported the Bill.</p>

Senator Leyden is a very experienced politician, having served as Minister of State in four Departments, Posts and Telegraphs, Transport, Health, and Industry and Commerce.  The seriousness with which Senators Tuffy and Browne took this legislation is one of the best accolades Senator Leyden could get.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">I commend Senator Leyden and his advisers on their industry in the preparation of this legislation.  It was my sad duty to indicate to the House the reservations the Government has about the measure.  That said, the Bill seeks to address a wider legitimate concern that wills can be lost, removed, stolen, suppressed or interfered with.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Senators mentioned that it is important to make a will.  As Senator Tuffy has stressed, the Oireachtas has provided for the distribution of assets in the event that no will is made.  Clear rules exist for the distribution of assets on intestacy.  Most people are aware that if a person dies with only a spouse and no children surviving, the entire estate vests in the spouse.  If a person dies with a spouse and children surviving, two thirds of the estate goes to the spouse and one third is divided among the children.  If a person dies without a spouse and with children, the estate is divided equally among the children.  Those are simple rules that most people understand.  Beyond that simple area of operation the rules become more difficult to understand.  It is certainly true that any single person is well advised to draw up a will.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">That said, the debate was useful.  Concern was raised about succession arrangements generally.  Senator Tuffy was very kind in her reference to how the Succession Act 1965 was enacted.  It was a consolidating and codifying measure, which introduced many changes in the law of inheritance at the same time.  One issue that arose in the debates on the 1965 Act and arose again this evening relates to the privacy and confidentiality which testators wish to have in the execution of their intentions in a will.  One of the problems with any system of public registration, which was hinted at in some of the amendments tabled, is that testators want a zone of confidentiality to attach to their operations in this regard, which makes the designation of a public register for these instruments very difficult.  I have expressed the views of the Government on the Bill and I thank the House for the attention it has given the measure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I do so on the basis that this is setting an historic precedent.  I concur with Senator Tuffy's comments about the Succession Act, introduced by the late Mr. Brian Lenihan Sn.  It was the most innovative succession Act anywhere in the world.  Up to that time, spouses were often thrown out of their houses which were left to children or strangers.  When a husband died, the widow had no rights.  That was changed by the then Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan Sn., whom I had the honour of serving as assistant director of elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I thank those who spoke, including Senator White for her very nice comments, which were much appreciated.  I also thank Senator Glynn, our spokesperson on health and children, who supported me in introducing the Bill, and Senator Feeney, the deputy spokesperson.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I was advised on this Bill by the barrister, Wesley Farrell.  I have served in four Departments and I found his assistance in preparing this Bill equal to if not better than any advice I got from departmental officials.  I express my thanks to him and wish him every success in the future.  Any Department would be fortunate to have his services available to it in preparing Bills.  Two of his colleagues are in the Seanad ante room working on the Bill's amendments for me.  I thank Bríd Miller, a solicitor in my area of Castlecoote, who advised me on the Bill initially and was very helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I thank my former secretary Sinéad Leyden, who was responsible for the research on the Bill.  She obtained research regarding the Council of Europe through the Internet.  I was surprised to find a Council of Europe directive that has not been ratified by the State.  I hope we may move on that idea.  I might encourage the Government to ratify that provision.  I thank my present staff, Stephen Brophy, my secretary, Alma Byrne, an intern who assisted in recent days, and my new secretary, Karl Whitney, who will be taking over from Stephen Brophy.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_592">I am grateful to the House for facilitating us in taking this Bill at short notice.  It has a simple but important objective, namely, to increase the statutory limit on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities that the Irish Film Board may incur.  As is the case with some statutory bodies that receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay when the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was enacted.  This limit must be updated by the Houses of the Oireachtas every three to five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2000 increased the limit from IR£30 million to IR£80 million, or approximately €101.5 million.  In the absence of amending legislation, spending by the Irish Film Board, inclusive of the recently announced additional allocation, will reach this statutory limit by the end of the year.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase this limit to €200 million, to allow the board to continue to operate within an appropriate statutory limit, subject to the normal annual Estimates process.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It is a positive mark of the activity of the board in recent times that it is now necessary to increase this limit again.  Following the publication of the 1998 strategic review of the audiovisual industry, known as the Kilkenny report, key Government decisions were taken to assign a central place in industrial policy to the audiovisual production industry.  This included a restructuring of the board itself that resulted in its staffing numbers growing from four in 2000 to its present staffing complement of 16.  In the same period, the board's Exchequer current and capital funding has risen from a total of €10.16 million in 2000 to €19.4 million by the end of 2006, almost a doubling in its funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">These past six years have seen the environment in which the board operates undergo massive and constant evolution and development, both domestically and internationally.  The board has reflected and adapted to these changes.  One cannot stand still in any endeavour, if it is to succeed, and the film sector is no exception.  One must adapt to changing circumstances, in the type of projects being developed, the audiences to be reached, and the markets to be targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Irish Film Board, with Government support, has adopted a strategic approach to meeting these challenges.  Through its varied schemes and programmes, it aims to assist projects at the earliest stage of development, right through the pre-production phase and finally to production and post-production.  It has established clear polices, from bringing forward and nurturing talent, using its short film schemes, up to its most recent initiative for company development, which is aimed at moving forward with several more established companies in streamlining their funding structures.  Through its funding of Screen Training Ireland, in conjunction with FÁS, the board addresses the needs of the industry at entry level.  Thus, training supports can be put in place to match the requirements of the market place and render its participants relevant to the sector they wish to enter.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The short film Oscar for "Six Shooter" and the Palme d'Or for "The Wind That Shakes The Barley" at the Cannes film festival are proof these policies are working.  The latter film, which is set in the time of the Civil War, went on to become the highest grossing independent Irish film at the Irish box office to date.  It has taken more than €20 million worldwide, proving there is an international market for Irish stories.  We can be confident there is real progress and cause for optimism for the Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Film is not just about talent, however.  It has become an international commodity, driven by economic incentives in an ever changing environment.  This, combined with the current dollar exchange rate imbalances, the domestic United States incentives and the low cost regimes in some Eastern EU states has resulted in less United States big budget projects being attracted here than was previously the case.  Moreover, one cannot deny the effect of the recently approved United Kingdom scheme on the Irish position.  We continue to monitor this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Government is aware of the needs of the sector and the need to react to such changes.  We were pleased to improve the scope of the section 481 scheme in the Finance Act 2006 and so maintain Ireland's position as an attractive location.  In an increasingly competitive international environment, the board is able to continue effectively to discharge its vital role of promoting our indigenous film industry and marketing Ireland as a location for international productions.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">This activity has yielded direct results.  2006 was an exciting and productive year for the film industry, with production activity returning to high levels.  As proof of this, some 38 projects were certified under the section 481 tax incentive scheme in 2006, with a total Irish spend of €115.6 million.  This is an increase from 28 projects in 2005, with an Irish spend of €64 million.  Included in the 2006 figures is a small number of large budget projects, chief among them being the television series, "The Tudors" and "Rough Diamond", as well as the television movie "Northanger Abbey".</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Looking to 2007, the board has succeeded in attracting new projects, including the feature film "Dorothy Mills" and television film "My Boy Jack", as well as further series of "The Tudors" and "Murphy's Law".  In other words, for 2006 alone, the film sector generated the equivalent expenditure of the Irish Film Board since its inception.  This is a remarkable rate of return by any measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">While Ireland can hold its own, due to our talent pool and incentives package, we cannot get complacent and must continue to search for and avail of any comparative advantage we can find.  We must also be active in the marketplace.  The Irish Film Board has risen to this challenge with the recent establishment of an office in Los Angeles, which it is expected will do much to raise awareness of the Irish industry in the United States.  The board has also put in place a Dublin film partnership scheme, a one-stop shop for potential producers seeking to produce projects in the city.  This grouping, encompassing businesses and public sector interests of the city, facilitates in overcoming the practical obstacles inherent in bringing a production to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Although 2005 and 2006 have been challenging years for production, indigenous films, supported by the Irish Film Board, have continued to perform to critical acclaim both at home and at festivals around the world.  Titles such as "Adam and Paul", "The Mighty Celt", "Breakfast on Pluto", "Isolation", "Pavee Lackeen" and "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" have been well received by audiences and critics.  Further affirmation in this respect are the nominations at world-renowned festivals in which Irish talent is well represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I appreciate Senators' co-operation in expediting the enactment of this short but vital Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_605">The House is united in taking this Bill at short notice.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has outlined the successes of the Irish film industry.  We have come a long way since "Ryan's Daughter".  One can read as many history textbooks as one wants, but there is nothing better than the cinematic representation of historical events.  This was exemplified by "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" and "Michael Collins" which acted as great tools in teaching about our history.  Will the Minister relate to the Irish Film Board that more films of such historical content are welcome?  They do not just inform people about our troubled history but about the beauty of Ireland.  The film industry is a good source of employment and benefits the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">When parts of "Saving Private Ryan" were filmed in Ireland, costs were lower.  With rising costs, it may be difficult to attract these types of production.  The Government, through tax incentives and so forth, should encourage and attract these types of productions.  Ireland has become a mecca for film producers.  From talking to them, they seem satisfied with the expertise available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The guarantees of the Irish Film Board were originally capped at £4.1 million.  Amending legislation in 1993 put that cap at £15 million, £30 million in 1997 and £80 million in 2000.  The latest amending legislation is designed to replace that figure with €200 million.  It seems to be awkward legislation.  The Finance Act sets spending in several areas and is presented on an annual basis.  Instead of the Seanad constantly amending the original 1980 Irish Film Board Act, would it be possible to include the correct and up-to-date amount as part of the Finance Act?</p>
          <p eId="para_608">What is the average cost of a film production in Ireland?  What grants and tax incentives have been received by film producers?  There are several historical movies I am interested in pursuing.  If one could get the finance, there would be assistance from various people.  I support this amending legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranPhelan" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Mr. K. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2006 which will amend the 2000 legislation to increase the maximum of the aggregate amount of any investments, loans, grants or moneys provided by the board from £80 million to €200 million.  This money will be put towards the cost of making films and providing training in all aspects of film production.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Without amending the current legislation, the Irish Film Board will reach the statutory limit by year-end, even taking into account its recently announced additional allocation.  The board's work is crucial to both arts and tourism and, as such, it is important to enact the legislation to support the ongoing assistance it provides to the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Irish Film Board assists and actively encourages the making of films in the State and also works towards developing an industry for the making of films.  The board promotes participation in international collaborative projects and regards, when it perceives to be appropriate, the need for film-making to be an expression of national culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Historically, Ireland has played host to a relatively small share of the global film market, approximately 1% of US films and on average 3.2% of UK films each year.  International competition to secure film productions is fierce.  We must continue to be active in the marketplace to ensure Ireland grows as a venue for major film productions.  Securing the production of such films not only impacts on the arts scene but also on the economy and positively affects tourism following the release of a film.  The recent success of the "Wind that Shakes the Barley" at the Palme D'Or shows we are succeeding in producing quality films.  We want to repeat these types of successes through supporting the work of the Irish Film Board.  I give the Bill my full support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_613">I welcome the legislation.  As it requires us to enact legislation co-operatively at short notice, we should not get any plaudits for it.  One can be proud of the Irish film industry which has grown because a movie-making infrastructure is in place.  Much money is available to pursue further development in this industry.  "Ryan's Daughter" was important for County Kerry's tourism industry and that has not been lost on the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">We have had a host of talented people in the Irish film industry who have brought their expertise to the silver screen at home and across the world.  One only needs to look at Brenda Fricker and her outstanding role in "My Left Foot" for which she won an Oscar.  The Gabriel Byrnes and the Patrick Bergins have gone on to build successful international careers, based on the home expertise that developed them.  We must acknowledge the role played by local drama societies and those who organise them.  That offers an opportunity for people who might not necessarily develop their talent in the absence of these groups.  It is good today to look back on outstandingly successful films.  Consider the film "Braveheart", many of whose scenes were shot in The Curragh.  Members of the FCA and people from all over the country were used as stand-ins in that film.  That was an important film.  There is only one instance in recent times where a film being made in Ireland was not completed.  It was "Divine Rapture" and was to star the late Marlon Brando, who stayed in Ballycotton for the shoot.  Unfortunately, owing to other problems the film was not finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">We must not forget the importance of the Irish film industry in international terms and how it is viewed by the international community.  We were able to take advantage of this not just in terms of culture but also with regard to tourism.  Consider what  "The Quiet Man" and Maureen O'Hara did for Irish tourism.  The film put the country on the international stage and opened doors that might not have been opened otherwise.  We can be proud of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The Irish film industry is also not afraid to delve into darker issues in the history of this country.  Consider the work of Aidan Quinn, who has mainly made independent films, and the thought-provoking, emotive but truthful account of what happened in Irish institutions in the film "Song for a Raggy Boy".  In the interest of fairness and balance we must acknowledge that and praise those involved in it.  Other independent films such as "This is My Father" also reflect part of Irish culture and society and show how society has moved on from that time.  We have much reason to be thankful to people who have practised in this profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">This is good legislation.  Its inspiration and objective are clear.  From small acorns do big trees grow and undoubtedly this is a good opportunity to develop and promote another generation of actors and actresses who can continue to represent all that is good in this country in terms of culture and tourism.  Well done to those who have already done it.  We owe them a great deal.  I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister for debating it with us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_618">I welcome the Bill.  Film is one of the most important cultural mediums of the present age.  Given a choice between reading the book <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> or watching the film, many will take the easy option of watching the film.  The Minister has been a strong advocate of the film industry both in terms of tax incentives and in legislation.  Experience has shown there is no point supporting the film industry by half measures.  If one attempts to do so, one simply loses competitiveness.  Many of our competitors have little compunction about the generosity of their incentives and if we wish to have a film industry, we must be the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The film industry embraces more than just Irish subjects.  Since the 1940s the fields of Agincourt have been located in Ireland, as have the Normandy beaches and the plains of central Europe in the film "Barry Lyndon".  Ireland can be converted into almost anywhere, possibly excepting the jungles of Peru.  There is immense potential for the industry.  I pay tribute to the many film successes which have done something for Ireland.  John Huston's "The Dead", based on James Joyce's story, is one of the most beautiful films I have seen.  One must also not forget series such as "Strumpet City" and if I wish to relax, I love to watch "The Irish RM".  "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" is an excellent if somewhat sobering and thought-provoking film.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I wish the film industry good fortune.  I am glad there are projects in the pipeline but we will not have a successful industry if we try to do it by half measures.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_621">This is important legislation.  We must keep the film industry going and Senator Mansergh is correct in that regard.  I share some of his favourite films.  "Barry Lyndon" was a superb film.  It was made at Huntingdon Castle in Clonegal.  The film crew put an extra wing on the castle which the owners were reluctant to demolish because it improved the castle's appearance.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The industry is a big income earner.  There are many important back-up personnel for the industry in this country.  Technical staff such as sound operators, cameramen, electricians, set designers, wardrobe directors——</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_626">I am glad to hear it.  There was a smile on his face and I mistook that to mean he was joking.  In fact, I believe an Irish make-up artist received an Oscar or a similarly important award in Los Angeles in recent years.  We should be very proud of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">There must be something dreadfully wrong in the air because I must agree with Senator Mansergh for a second time in the space of a few minutes.  He is correct that there is strong competition.  While we have a remarkable country of natural beauty, scenic availability and reasonable light for film making, many other European countries can offer the same.  We need the additional seed money for projects in addition to understanding and acknowledging the talent in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I have mentioned the technical personnel but we also have superb actors.  Sometimes we treat them simply as objects of gossip.  Gabriel Byrne, for example, is a wonderful actor.  Angeline Ball is another.  I have seen "Molly Bloom" until she is coming out of my ears, so to speak, and I have seen her represented by international actors of the greatest distinction but I have never seen a rendition that could hold a candle to Angeline Ball in that wonderful film, "Bloom", by Seán Walsh.  He is a courageous man who had the guts and gumption to take on James Joyce's regrettable grandson and win.  That is something.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">We have not always fostered the film industry.  I am glad the Minister has chosen to do so and to ensure sufficient money is available.  I recall gallant people such as the late Liam O'Leary.  Without him and his archiving skills we would have lost an enormous amount of very valuable cine reality.  We would have lost entire productions.  Rex Ingram, for example, was one of the crucial figures in the development of Hollywood in the 1920s.  He made a film entitled "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and at least one reel of the film went missing.  Nobody in the world had it until Liam O'Leary unearthed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I pay tribute to a man I am honoured to know, George Morrison.  The Minister launched a remarkable DVD, "Mise Éire", which George put together from archive material from the 1916 and Civil War periods.  He followed it with another DVD called "Saoirse".  He commissioned the music from the late Seán Ó Riada.  It is a masterpiece of Irish cinema.  He was paid approximately £150 for it and got no repeat fees.  He was neglected as an artist for many years.  He had a project to make a film about James Joyce, which was turned down by the Government of the day as an unsuitable topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">However, I am glad to say that Mr. Morrison was honoured by the present Minister, who launched this CD.  Although he is in his 80s and has suffered a stroke, Mr. Morrison made a remarkable speech and is at work on another film.  I am engaged in a small way with him and it is an honour to be involved with such a great artist.  I bemoan the days when people such as Mr. Liam O'Leary and Mr. Morrison were so neglected.  I hope those days are gone.  It is not just a question of money but of the image Ireland presents to the world.  It can be an effective instrument in representing a positive version of this country, which we love.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_632">I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate for their constructive and considered points on the Bill.  I also thank them for taking it at short notice.  It is an important piece of legislation and I am grateful to them for their time.  I would like to respond to some of the points raised in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">There has been a significant improvement in the number of incoming productions to Ireland in recent years.  From 1994 to 2001 the amount approved by way of section 481 was €581.8 million.  In 2002 it was €62.2 million and in 2003 €84.8 million.  Then there was uncertainty as to whether section 481 relief would continue and in 2004 the amount approved decreased to €58.1 million and in 2005 to €54.8 million.  Certainty has been established on section 481 and it is operational.  To date this year, the total amount approved under the section is €110.5 million.  It is clear that this incentive to inward production is a major attractor.  In that context the British have improved their tax relief and we must monitor this carefully.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, takes a personal interest in film and has been involved in improving the attracting components of British financial legislation for film.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">We should not engage in a Dutch auction as there is nothing to be gained from it.  In this year's Finance Act the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, increased our cap to €35 million and improved incentives as much as he could.  We are unique in that we alone provide tax relief for television productions and that has resulted in a major increase in the number of television productions in the country in recent years.  It is difficult to remain competitive.  When Ireland first introduced section 481 it was unique and we experienced a large growth in our film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">It is important to recognise the role of the Irish Film Board.  With limited resources and a small staff it is doing well.  It contributed €500,000 to "The Wind that Shakes the Barley", which was made for €6 million.  It has grossed €20 million worldwide.  It is a wonderful film, even if it takes my side in the Civil War.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_643">In October 2005 we confirmed an additional €1.5 million in supplementary funding for Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  Via its judicious selection of projects in which to invest, this funding delivered production activity with a combined Irish budget of €28 million in 2006.  So an investment of €1.5 million yielded €28 million.  I would accept that return at Fairyhouse or Leopardstown racecourses any day.  The additional funding achieved an excellent leverage rate of 18:1.  In 2006 an additional €2 million in supplementary funding was made available to the IFB and this is expected to generate at least €32 million worth of production activity in Ireland in early 2007.  That gives an idea of the value of film production to our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Irish Film Board is the major funder of Screen Training Ireland, the organisation that provides continuing training for professionals in film, television, animation and digital media.  Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 630 participants have undertaken professional training in the organisation annually.  A summary of the grants which the IFB has made available is available in the IFB's annual report, which we can make available to Senator Feighan.  It is impossible to specify an amount for the IFB every year because that is part of the Estimates process.  All we can do is bring in enabling legislation such as this every five years or so.  This enabling legislation should see us through for another five years.  We are increasing the amount the IFB can disburse to €200 million and it is not anticipated that it will require further legislation for approximately five years.  However as a follower of film I hope we require legislation earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We have tried to assist the industry as best we can.  Between 2000 and 2007, Government support for the IFB has grown by 93%, ensuring security for the sector by enabling the IFB to continue support for training, production and development and the introduction of new initiatives in keeping with the development and demands of the sector.  Between 2003 and 2005 an average of 740 applications were made to the IFB annually with a success rate of 25%.  I have established that we are achieving value for money and IFB production investment outlays have an average leveraging factor of approximately 1:10 as the €50.02 million worth of IFB production loans for feature films, television dramas and animation between 1993 and 2005 stimulated production with combined budgets of €482.65 million.  For every €1 of IFB investment during that period, almost €10 million was generated from the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I acknowledge the wonderful role the IFB plays.  We are excited that we have a full-time representative in Los Angeles representing the Irish film industry and trying to attract major productions into the country.  When visitors to this country are surveyed, as they frequently are by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, film is the single biggest attractor cited.  We should always remember this.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I noted that Senator McCarthy was involved in drama and that he has moved his talents to a bigger stage.  I note that Senator Mansergh is a fan of "The Irish RM".  I can envisage Senators Mansergh and Norris on the set of "The Irish RM".</p>

            <p eId="para_659">There is an urgent need to provide additional permanent accommodation at St. Mary's national school, Virginia, County Cavan.  The school has 309 pupils enrolled but was originally built for 200 pupils.  A substantial part of the accommodation needs are met by prefabs.  The Department has replied to concerns raised by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, stating that as part of the assessment of the school's application a detailed assessment of demographic trends, housing developments and enrolment trends is needed.  This would ensure capital funding would deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's needs.  The Department stated that when the assessment is complete a decision will be made on the current and long-term accommodation needs.  The building project required will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The Department must make a thorough assessment of accommodation needs and I hope it is completed shortly.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Smith, has consistently raised this matter with the Minister for Education and Science and officials at the Department.  I met the Minister, Deputy Smith, and Councillor Shane O'Reilly in November.  I raised the matter again in recent days.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">I welcome the Minister's assurance that this application is a priority and I appreciate her interest.  I raise the matter now to highlight the need for the project to proceed to the next stage.  I hope it will be included in the 2007 schools building programme.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_233">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_662">I thank the Cathaoirleach for his warm message of congratulations.  I also thank the Leader, Senator Wilson and all Senators.  I was honoured to serve in this House from 1987-92.  The last words I uttered in this House were in 1992 and I suspect the subject was Aer Lingus.  It is great to be here in a different capacity.  I respect the role of this House even though some people try to undermine it in our parliamentary democracy.  The Seanad plays an important role in our democracy and I support that.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">I thank Senator Wilson for raising these matters as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and, in particular, to outline the position regarding the proposed building project for St. Mary's national school in Virginia.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools, as well as responding to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a major priority for the Government.  Since taking office, this Government has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">As evidence of this commitment, approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects are under way in our primary and post-primary schools in 2006.  This year some €500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country, compared to €90 million in 1997.  Funding has been increased in recent years with an aggregate total of more than €2 billion in 2000-05 and a commitment to invest a further €3.9 billion up to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">This record level of investment is a testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring school accommodation is of the highest standard.  To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have been also developed for schools with eight and 16 classrooms to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and to save on design fees.  The design and build method is also used to expedite delivery where the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of available funding, these initiatives ensure building projects are delivered within the fastest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">St. Mary's national school in Virginia is a co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 309 pupils.  In recent years an upward trend in enrolment at the school has necessitated a review by the Department of housing developments, demographic trends and enrolment trends in the area to ensure any capital funding provided will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's need into the future.  On completion of this assessment, a decision will be taken by the Department and conveyed to the school on how best to provide for the school's long-term accommodation needs.  A site visit will be required to inform the final brief for the project and the Department will be in contact with the school authority to arrange this at the appropriate time.  Following the site visit, the brief will be completed and the project will be considered for progress in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2007 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">I assure the House that school building projects are selected by the Department for inclusion in a capital programme on the basis of priority of need presenting, which is determined by published prioritisation criteria formulated following consultation with the education partners.  Application of these criteria to capital funding submissions and the publication of the school building programme ensure that maximum openness and transparency apply to the school building and modernisation programme.  Most importantly, this approach ensures all schools applying for capital funding can know how their applications will be treated and when they are likely to progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">I assure Senator Wilson that the Department is anxious to move ahead with the school building project and every effort will be made to finalise an accommodation brief in order that the project can move to the next stage.  I thank Senator Wilson for raising this matter and I hope the response gives him some encouragement.</p>
