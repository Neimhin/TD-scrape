            <from>Senator Keith Swanick<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for coming to the House to answer questions which have been worrying the community of Kinlough, County Leitrim. While canvassing the area during the Seanad elections, I had the pleasure of visiting the health centre and speaking with the local public health nurse. It was clear from speaking to the various people I met in the area that they felt very let down by the HSE in respect of the primary health centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> A GP service is currently offered at the health centre twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays, by appointment. In June of last year, I made representations to the HSE regarding the lack of adequate GP cover in the area and I was informed that there are no plans to increase the level of GP cover in the area. I was also informed that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays there is GP cover at the health centre in Bundoran, which is three miles from Kinlough, or at the primary care centre in Ballyshannon, which is seven miles from Kinlough. A person in the full of their health would have no problem travelling these distances but we need to keep in mind that the people visiting GPs and care centres are not in the full of their health. They are in need of medical attention and, as such, we can rightly assume that they are in some form of pain or distress. The fact they cannot visit a doctor in their own locality only adds to this distress and, in my opinion, it is disgraceful in this day and age. There are other rural locations with a full-time GP service, for example, Bangor Erris and Glenamoy in County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> For 150 years following the Great Famine, the population of Kinlough village stood at just 350 people. The 2006 census showed an increase for the first time, the 2011 census figures had the population at just over 1,000, an increase of 47% on 2006. The preliminary results from the 2016 census show that this trend is continuing. Kinlough is the third largest urban area in County Leitrim and has the county's largest primary school, which 270 pupils currently attend. It also has three preschools and, like the rest of the country, is home to an aging population.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> As a GP, I am only too aware of the pressures on general practice. However, I also feel that, in this instance, there is a compelling argument for an enhanced service. I ask the Minister of State to examine the feasibility of returning the responsibility for Kinlough health centre to the Leitrim primary care area, as opposed to the Ballyshannon-Bundoran area. The community of Kinlough deserves better. They need services which will address the needs of the population, both young and old.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HelenMcEntee" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I thank Senator Swanick for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who sends his apologies. I have been advised by the HSE that primary care services in Kinlough are currently delivered from a rented premises in the town. I understand the services delivered include GP services, public health nursing, including child development clinics, consultant psychiatry clinics, community mental health nursing, counselling services and autism therapy services. As the Senator said, the GP service is provided as an outreach from the main centres of practice in Bundoran and Ballyshannon and the centre is an extremely important part of the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The primary health care centre is Kinlough was rented by the HSE in 2004. As this was originally a domestic type dwelling, a number of works were carried out to make the property fit for purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The HSE has advised that an issue has arisen about the negotiation on the rental value of the property which is ongoing and as this is a private matter between the owners and the HSE, I am sure the Seanad will appreciate that I cannot comment on this particular issue. However, I want to reassure the Senator that the HSE has informed me that services are continuing to be provided from these premises in Kinlough. </p>
            <p eId="para_23"> As Senator Swanick is aware, one of the Government's key priorities is to implement a decisive shift in the health services to primary care. Our ultimate goal, and as Minister of State with responsibly for older people, my goal is to make sure that people get the care they need as close to home as possible and have access to a greater range of health and social care services within their community. Enhancing and expanding capacity in the primary care sector is crucial to ensuring delivery of a preventive, joined-up approach to the management of the nation's health and the modernisation of primary care delivery. In a fully developed primary care system, 90% to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met within that primary care setting. It is very important to stress that from the point of view of people using the wide range of services provided by the HSE at community level, services must be responsive to their needs. It must also enable them to receive a joined-up service that results in the most favourable health outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> It is on the record that this Government is steadfast in its support of the decisive shift to primary care and it is useful to point out that some of the successes in helping to achieve this include the extension of eligibility for GP cards to children under six and those over 70, the development of diabetes cycle of care and ongoing investment in the physical infrastructure for primary care. Quite significant investment has also been made in the development of the primary care capacity, particularly in the therapy area.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> The Senator will also be aware that the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare is considering issues such as the long-term vision for health policy, the implications of demand projections for the preferred model of care and how this can be achieved, and the associated funding models. It is important that the committee will make recommendations to guide us on the journey to universal health care. Primary care must and will be a key feature and I await with great interest the outcome of the committee's deliberations. </p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The Senator's suggestion that this would move into the Leitrim primary care area is something that might be raised after the committee has finished its deliberations and once it is planning the future of what primary care in this country will look like.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I thank the Minister of State. I have liaised closely with local councillor, Justin Warnock, on this issue. There are a few important issues arising which I will refer to briefly. Over 10% of the total population of Leitrim live in the Kinlough area. Currently, hearing and dental checks are not being conducted in the health centre, but in the local school which has 270 pupils. This causes major disruption. The village continues to grow. The people of Kinlough deserve a full-time GP service, five days a week. I welcome what the Minister of State has said but I will continue to lobby on this issue.</p>

          <speech by="#MariaByrne" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_29">I rise to raise the issue of the primary medical certificate. This is required by people who apply for a disabled driver's pass. The disabled drivers scheme is very positive. There have been a number of initiatives that have been improved in recent years such as the amount of money that is allowed towards the car adaptation. Disabled drivers can park in disabled parking spaces and this helps many people who have severe disabilities. The rules state that applicants: "must be completely or almost completely without the use of both legs, or completely without the use of one of the legs, and almost completely without the use of the other leg to the extent that you are severely restricted as regards movement in your legs, be without both hands or both arms, be without one or both legs, be completely or almost completely without the use of both hands or arms and completely or almost completely without the use of one leg or have the medical condition of dwarfism and serious difficulties of movement of the legs."</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> While I understand that people with these conditions qualify for this primary medical certificate, I am aware of a case involving a gentleman with no sight in one eye and only 40% sight in the other eye. He is obviously not allowed to drive, but under the scheme a family member can apply for the pass on their behalf and avail of the benefits which go with it. This man also uses a walking aid. Due to the fact that the scheme is so restrictive, there is no scope for discretion which is what I am looking for. Each case would have to be taken on its merits and if people were trying to fool the system I would agree that they should not qualify. However, I would like that some form of discretion would be included in the scheme so that each case would be taken on its own merits if it does not qualify within the original rules.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Senator for raising this issue in the House. I am very sorry to hear about the difficulties faced by the individual referred to by the Senator. As she will be aware, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 provides relief from VAT and VRT, up to a certain limit, on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of a fuel grant, and an exemption from motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> To qualify for the scheme an applicant must be in possession of a primary medical certificate. To qualify for a primary medical certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions which the Senator listed in her remarks. The senior medical officer for the relevant HSE administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a primary medical certificate which is required under the regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the scheme. </p>
            <p eId="para_33"> An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the senior medical officer to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The regulations mandate that the medical board of appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. The criteria to qualify for the scheme are necessarily precise and specific. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in his or her condition. The scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the vehicle registration tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant provided for members of the scheme, the scheme represented a cost of €65 million in 2016. This does not include the revenue foregone to the local government fund in respect of the relief from motor tax provided to members of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The Minister for Finance recognises the important role that the scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. </p>
            <p eId="para_35"> From time to time the Minister, Deputy Noonan, receives representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While he has sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the scheme, the Minister for Finance has no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p>

I can give the Senator a list of these, although I am sure she already has them.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am raising this issue on behalf of Councillor Gerard Flynn who is a member of Clare County Council. It relates to the burdensome problem of wild ivy attaching itself to trees, a problem that arises not just in County Clare but also throughout the country. The ivy which is sometimes referred to as "English ivy" is causing damage to the native tree population, both in public amenity areas and also on private property. It does not kill a tree, but the resulting activity after it has started to grow can kill the tree. It creates competition for nutrients, water and sunlight. It makes a tree weaker and more prone to disease and branch dieback. It also contributes to the added moisture around the bark which attracts bugs and accelerates rot. As it grows from the ground up, branch dieback is usually evident at the bottom of the tree initially. This leaves the tree looking like a stalk of broccoli, with a head at the top. It creates an imbalance for branches and there is the added weight of the ivy at the top. As a result, the tree is more prone to falling during drastic weather events, which means that it is also a safety issue. I live in County Donegal and the wind on the western seaboard can be atrocious, particularly during the winter. Trees that are heavily weighted with ivy at the top are less balanced and can fall in the wind. They have been known to cause accidents when they fall across a road. I have often encountered instances of trees falling across a public road, resulting in it being blocked or an accident being caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I am not sure whether the Department has conducted an analysis of this issue as it might be a new or emerging problem, but on behalf of Councillor Flynn I am asking the Minister of State to carry out a nationwide review to ascertain the extent of the problem and whether a policy intervention by the Department is required. Perhaps he might consider my request. I am not sure if it is an issue in County Wicklow, but I am told it is a growing problem along the western seaboard. People in the United States refer to this as the "English ivy" problem. To remedy it, they do not cut the ivy away from the tree, as Senator Billy Lawless will be aware, but cut it at the bottom of the tree and pull out the roots to stop it from growing. It then dies. Perhaps that solution might be considered. It is probably an extensive problem if it has to be dealt with on a countrywide basis, but it might be more prevalent in some counties than in others. Has the Department carried out any analysis?</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I will be happy to discuss other aspects of the matter later.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Ivy is an evergreen shrub that is found growing in the wild in Ireland. It is a native species that contributes to the diversity of plants growing in many habitats, both within woodland settings and on individual trees. As a species, the native ivy has received criticism in some quarters. Ivy uses trees for support and to climb and takes no moisture or nutrients from the tree. In other words, it is not a parasite. Its benefits are wide-ranging and play an important role in contributing to the biodiversity of woodland ecosystems and individual trees. The shelter and nesting opportunities provided by ivy are beneficial for many species of birds. It also provides habitats for insects. The berries produced provide a source of food for birds during the autumn and winter months when food is scarce. In addition, the nectar and pollen produced by the flowers are important for different species of insects.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> In some cases, ivy can be found growing in large quantities on trees that are unhealthy and not growing well. Trees suffering from diseases or stress may have more open crowns which, in turn, allow the ivy present to grow vigorously with increasing light levels. In these situations the ivy can appear to be the cause of a tree's decline but, in effect, there are usually other underlying factors. The Department periodically carries out national forest inventories which collect a wide range of data that are used to assess, among other things, the total forest cover and the health of the forest estate. All plant species are recorded in forest plots taken as part of the inventory which includes ivy if it is present. The latest published forest inventory results from data collected in a period between 2004 and 2006 found that, in general, the health and vitality of forests in Ireland were considered to be good. The national forest inventory estimates that the total area of forest cover in Ireland is approximately 11% of the land area. As with all living things, there is a natural process and trees will either be felled for timber, succumb to disease or die of old age.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> In the normal course of forest management ivy is not routinely removed and, in general, does not affect the productive capacity of healthy trees. In some cases, heavy growth of ivy on trees can make it more difficult to fell trees, but the impact is limited. Individual trees growing on roadsides can sometimes carry large amounts of ivy owing to a tree's weakened condition which can make a tree liable to fall over in high winds. Landowners in general should continue to monitor the condition of their roadside trees and remove unhealthy dangerous trees in the interests of health and safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> In summary, it is not necessary to carry out a national tree survey to assess the impact of ivy on tree growth. That would prove to be an extremely costly exercise when it has been found that the current health and vitality of trees in Ireland’s forests are generally good. Even if Ireland were to instigate a strategy to remove or limit the growing of ivy, it would have consequences for biodiversity and reduce shelter for other species. Controlling ivy by removing a portion of the stem of the plant by manual cutting would have little impact as new plants would regenerate. Embarking on a national survey and control programme would not be effective and would not provide value for money. We should accept ivy as part of the community of plants found on trees.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I accept the Minister of State's response. The Department would certainly have the best data available. One interesting point made in the Minister of State's response is that he agrees with my position on trees on the roadside and the danger of their being blown down. There is one option that could be considered and which might provide value for money. Perhaps the Department, in conjunction with local authorities, might carry out some evaluation of roadside trees that have ivy attached to them to ascertain the danger they pose. If local authorities could be provided with a small contribution, I am sure they would carry out such an assessment as a first step in mitigating any danger of roadside trees falling over as a result of being damaged by ivy. That useful first step could be carried out on a pilot basis. It could even be carried out in a number of counties, starting in County Clare, to ascertain if there was a need to roll it out further. It might be a way of mitigating any huge financial burden on the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The last inventory was carried out in the period 2004 to 2006 and there is another assessment under way. It is expected that the status of the general health of the tree population of the country will not have changed that much, save to say that in the interim, <i>Chalara fraxinea</i>, or ash dieback as it is commonly known, has been identified on an all-county basis. That has been accepted by the Department. I am not ignoring the Senator's core point but I wish to explain the context that it is a disease we will have to manage rather than eradicate or eliminate.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> Much of the ash was traditionally used on roadsides. To return to the Senator's point, while <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> itself can cause the disease, it does not necessarily undermine the vitality of the tree. In the ongoing assessment of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> and the monitoring of ash, it might be possible to keep an eye on the ivy and to assess it. The reason roadside trees are often planted on mounds is because road traffic undermines the roots and they get caught in winds, and that is why they become so susceptible. They tend to have been planted many years ago before we had an afforestation programme. Their age profile, if one can use that term, is considerably older than many of the trees which were planted in forests <i>per se</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Every county has trees but in Wicklow there is a higher proportion of forest estates than anywhere else and we also have a lot of roadside trees. It is an ongoing issue. My perception of it is that the ivy was causing the problem but sometimes it is the other way around. In monitoring the safety of trees on roadsides in particular we need to assess the amount of ivy and ascertain whether it is an issue. Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to pulling up the roots. Just cutting ivy without uprooting it would slow it down but it would not stop it regenerating because the nutrients that allowed it to grow in the first place are still in the surrounding area. It is a climber which will continue to climb. I thank the Senator for raising the issue. I have learned a lot by having to deal with the issue today.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I support those protesting for better services for children with disabilities. On 2 April, we had World Autism Day. I join in the support for those involved in the Enough is Enough campaign who have been protesting in recent days. The HSE responded to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy James Browne, and confirmed that in Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-West alone the total number of people on waiting lists to receive speech therapy services is 2,883. That figure is absolutely scandalous and unacceptable. This is only one area of services needed by children with disabilities. Others include occupational therapy, physiotherapy and respite services. These figures alone are an indictment, while the anecdotal evidence from parents on the street suggests that figures for other services are as bad if not worse. I am calling on the Leader to call on the Minister for Health to address this inequality, to ensure that we look after children and adults with disabilities. Dublin South-Central alone has one of the highest proportions of people with disabilities in the country. It is unfair not to give services to people who need them to live some level of a decent life and take part in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I would also like to emphasise the lack of funding for respite services, not only for children but for parents. For some reason in the past few years, the funding available has decreased. I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Health if anything can be done to increase the funding for respite services.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I would also like to talk about a national issue, namely, rehabilitation services in Ireland. I ask the Leader if he could organise for the Minister for Health to come to the Seanad and outline the national plan for our rehabilitation services. On a number of occasions, I have raised the matter of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, on Rochestown Avenue in Dún Laoghaire. Some weeks ago, other Senators also highlighted this matter. One issue to which I wish to refer relates to the closure of 12 beds just after Christmas. We obtained an undertaking that the Minister would return to the House to explain what happened but we never heard a thing. I made contact with the NRH this week and was informed there has been no change in circumstances. The 12 beds that were closed because of resourcing issues have not been reopened. This is against a background of hundreds of patients all over the country holding up essential acute beds, which the health services say are needed to continue the roll-out of more comprehensive services. Health is becoming one of the biggest issues facing the country. While I recognise that the Minister is doing an awful lot of work, there is much that needs to be put right. Progress has to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> The second issue is that the NRH was meant to be the subject of a rebuilding programme. Five different health Ministers have been out there making announcements about the 120-bed unit, yet it still has not been built. There has not been one sod turned. There is a bigger debate to be had as to whether we should centralise national rehabilitation hospitals, with four or five centres of excellence across the country. How can we free up acute beds to allow that to happen? The immediate issue is to get the 12 beds open. How can we have a new hospital of 120 beds on the programme, which is to commence within weeks, if we cannot reopen 12 beds on the same campus? This raises serious questions. I would appreciate it if the Leader could arrange for the Minister to come to the House to explain the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> I acknowledge the work of the national broadband plan. It is exciting. Although there was a great deal of negative commentary in the newspapers today, it is major progress. There will be a presentation by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, today in the audio-visual room and I am looking forward to hearing what he has to say. We should congratulate him and acknowledge the work he has done on the roll-out of broadband throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">Diabetes will be one of the major challenges facing our health service in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The Minister for Health met representatives of the Donegal Diabetes Association in Letterkenny General Hospital in December and learned about the serious crisis in the provision of care for adults with type 1 diabetes in the county. They have to wait 21 months for follow-up appointments. The provision of such care prevents very serious conditions from occurring down the line. Not only has the crisis not been addressed, it has got worse. We have learned this morning that the paediatric endocrinologist in Sligo who is responsible for providing the pump therapy clinics in Letterkenny for children in County Donegal will move to a new position and not be replaced. Children in County Donegal who require pump therapy will be forced to travel to Sligo and perhaps even to Dublin for treatment. This is a really serious matter. There has been a lot of anger in County Donegal for years because we believe the support provided for those with diabetes is well below what has been agreed in the national diabetes programme. I urge the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for urgent attention in order that he will be aware not only of how the issue affects adults but also how the problem has got worse in the sense that children in the county will lose a vital service. Will the Leader ask the Minister to respond to me urgently.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">For some time I have been referring to the fact that Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, has the longest gynaecology waiting lists in the country. This causes fear and endangers the health of women who are desperately waiting for an outpatient appointment or an urgent procedure or treatment. For a change, however, I want to report some positive developments and give credit where credit is due. Last week the doctors' plan developed with hospital group management involving new governance procedures and an investment of €14 million was signed off on by the Minister for Health. I thank all of my colleagues in this and the other House who joined me in highlighting the long gynaecology waiting lists in CUMH for keeping the pressure on and helping to broker solutions. I know that we will all be monitoring the progress of the plan to ensure women on the waiting list are reached that it will make a difference. I commend the work of Senator Colm Burke and the Leader in this matter. I ask the Leader to pass on my thanks to the Minister and his officials for the breakthrough made last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> I thank colleagues for their cross-party support for the Adult Safeguarding Bill which I will bring forward this afternoon. Given the recent examples of abuse and harm caused to adults, we can all agree that the Bill is timely. It draws on a painful learning from our experiences and cases with which we have become too familiar. It is forward-looking, constructive and, in the words of Mervyn Taylor from Sage, the support and advocacy service for older people, replaces the indignation that we are all so very good at showing on legislation. I am looking forward to the debate and hope as many Members as possible will contribute because like all Bills, it can be improved and amended. Of course, I hope all Members will support its passage.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I express my disappointment at the disgraceful treatment of the senior Irish women's soccer team by the FAI. The lack of basic facilities and support for professional and semi-professional sport stars is appalling. I am very disappointed that this heavily State-aided and cash-rich professional organisation treats its stars so appallingly and leaves them without access to nutritionists and a gym. Non-professionals who work full time or part time do not have their out-of-pocket expenses covered when representing their country. They also have problems with the accommodation provided when representing their country. The payment of a reasonable gratuity is only fair. One hopes a modern organisation will try to make progress and give equal status to women. Therefore, I hope the FAI will "man up", for want of a better term, and do the right thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I attended the debate last night in Dáil Éireann on the current state of the Defence Forces. I compliment Deputy Lisa Chambers on the wonderful presentation she made. Deputy Marc MacSharry addressed the issue I had addressed in this House yesterday, namely, RAF jets flying in Irish airspace. Subsequent to my presentation yesterday, the National Security Committee was brought to my attention. I am horrified that there is zero oversight by the Oireachtas of this vital committee which is responsible for the security of the nation. In the United Kingdom there is a parliamentary committee that is solely responsible for the management and oversight of all security services. In this country there is no accountability to this House, the Members of which are democratically elected. The Leader can decide which Minister is responsible for the matter, but I am asking him to bring a Minister to the House at his convenience to enable us to discuss the security of the State. The National Security Committee is reactive and not proactive. There is a disjointed and unco-ordinated approach to intelligence gathering and security, including cyber security and espionage. As the matter needs urgent attention, I ask the Leader to deal with it at his convenience. We should not, however, leave it in the pot too long.</p>

However, there is also a good news story in that a 12-bed rehabilitation unit will be built at Roscommon County Hospital. The project is in the planning stages, but it will be a rehabilitation unit for the west. It will involve the decentralisation of a necessary, important and valuable resource and I would like to see it being progressed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Before Christmas and following the very successful visit of the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, to the Seanad where she was treated like a rock star, I argued that Ireland should seek a unique solution in the Brexit talks. I said we should invite the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, to come to the House to address Gibraltar's concerns which I know are completely different from ours. Spain wants to have a veto in discussing the future of Gibraltar. While we would not be getting involved in that discussion, the Seanad should look at and discuss the interests of all of the various countries that will be involved in the Brexit negotiations. The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alfonso Dastis, has appealed to the British to calm down. Former British Ministers have said Great Britain should use measures akin to those used in the Falklands War. We also need to inform ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_70"> I am told workers providing homelessness services in Galway have unanimously backed a campaign to secure the Labour Court's recommended hourly rate for overnight working. A Labour Court ruling in 2014 recommended that time spent on overnight or "sleepover" duty should be acknowledged as constituting working time and workers should be paid the national minimum hourly rate, which is €9.25, for this duty. IMPACT has today explained that when the union sought the payment for staff working in the Galway Simon Community, the employer stated that it was unable to pay as the HSE had not provided the funding to allow it to do so. The employer accepts that staff have a legal entitlement to the payment but the HSE is withholding the funding. This is clearly not an acceptable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> The HSE, as we all know, pays its staff the proper rate and provides money to other funded agencies to allow them to do so. It does not make sense, therefore, to exclude the staff at the Simon Communities or in any other homelessness agency effectively providing services through the night for €4.50 per hour, which is less than half of the national minimum wage. There are 50 staff at Galway Simon Community, including housing support officers and housing support assistants. The local IMPACT representative, Mr. Pádraig Mulligan, has stated the staff are highly experienced and entered the workplace with recognised third level qualifications in social care. The employer and the HSE accept that the money is owed but nobody is prepared to release the funds. We have had much discussion about the homelessness issue but these homelessness service workers, who are very important in trying to support the people who find themselves in such a difficult position, certainly need to be supported as well. I would welcome a debate with the relevant Minister, who would be the Minister for Health because as this is a HSE funding issue. He could come to the House so we could discuss the work being provided by these homelessness services and the workers being paid only €4.50 per hour for work they are doing overnight.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">The first three Senators who spoke on the Order of Business - Senators Ardagh, Boyhan and Mac Lochlainn - dealt with matters relating to disability and I did not coach any of them. I have said before that social housing for people with disabilities now has a waiting list of nearly 6,000 instead of 4,000 and recent figures indicate that poverty has increased for people with disabilities. There are also matters of employment, as approximately 31% of people with disabilities of employment age are employed. There is also the question of young people with disabilities living in nursing homes. We have heard this before and I hope we will not have to keep listening to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I particularly mention a report I read in the <i>Mail on Sunday</i>, written by Ms Niamh Griffin, which indicates that internal Government papers demonstrate that even when the UN convention is finally ratified, the health service will not be able to afford to deliver on its promise. The nub of the piece centres on a memo sent by officials to the Minister, Deputy Harris, last October. It states that even with ratification in place, it should "also be noted that the health system as currently structured does not have the capacity to deliver the provision now proposed without significant extra resources". It also points to the fact that the service is not yet in a position to appoint a director on foot of the assisted decision-making legislation passed well over a year ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> There are issues about Brexit and other matters in this country but there is a running sore of loss and further degradation for people with disabilities and their families, not just throughout the recession but continuing to now. I request that the Taoiseach come to this House - he has given an undertaking that he would do so a number of times every year. He should either confirm what is in the report - that the Government is not prepared and is slowing down the process of ratification because of cost implications - or be honest with people with disabilities and say that the Government is getting on with the job. This coming budget will be the third and possibly mid-cycle budget from this Government. It is important that there is action to stop the decline seen by people with disabilities and start building up services. This Government will be remembered because it has to deal with Brexit but it will also be remembered because of how it has or has not dealt with this issue. There should be less rhetoric and more action.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I agree with Senator Feighan on inviting to this Chamber, as opposed to the separate Seanad Brexit committee, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar. I mentioned previously that this is absolutely a fitting stage for foreign heads of state to address the Irish people. Only this week we saw the Croatian President, Mrs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi, visiting the country. There have been some lovely engagements but she has not had the opportunity to engage with the Irish people or their representatives in an appropriate manner. This Chamber would be such a setting and I fully agree with Senator Feighan's earlier remarks in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The regulation of lobbying legislation is under review and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to debate that review in this House. There is a glaring oversight in the Act, as there is a need to regulate better for overseas lobbying of the Irish Government and Ministers, especially when our Ministers spend so much time in Brussels, Strasbourg and across the European Union. There is no requirement for lobbyists to register any lobbying activity if it is carried out outside the jurisdiction of Ireland. It is a glaring anomaly that is open to abuse. I hope it has not yet been abused but I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister as a matter of urgency to debate this very important review.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">The last Government made a number of serious errors, one of which was an attempt to abolish this House. I am thankful the people resoundingly rejected that. Another action, which was more successful, was the abolition of town council governance. I draw Members' attention to the fact that my party colleague, Deputy Shane Cassells, will move a Bill in the Lower House today asking for a commission to be set up that would report in the next six months, with proposals to restore an enhanced form of town government. Many colleagues would be glad to hear of that. The idea is the commission would report in time for local elections in 2019 to town councils as well as county councils. Towns have suffered much in recent years due to the economic downturn and the town council was a very important facet of life and support for business people in small towns in rural Ireland. Members will welcome this Bill if and when it comes before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> I hope I will not be accused of being parochial but I will comment on the announced retirement of the Leas-Chathaoirleach's fellow townsman from Gaelic football, Mr. Colm Cooper, or the "Gooch", as he is also known.

          <p eId="para_83">There are many workers out and they have young families and are under severe financial pressure. Bus Éireann is a huge and vital component of our public transport system. The strike is having a big impact on commuters in Limerick. Small businesses in Limerick city which are dependent on passing trade have experienced a drop in turnover. People are not able to access the city in the normal way. I ask that these be fruitful talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> One of the elements that has to come into play is the public service obligation, PSO, services. The PSO model has not kept pace with the Expressway route. Bus Éireann is servicing towns along those routes that private operators are not servicing. There has to be a PSO element because there is not a level playing field. We need fairness. People using free travel passes on the service are rightly entitled to do so. However, Bus Éireann is not compensated for that. I welcome that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has said that the PSO model will be looked at again.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> I wish the talks well. It is extremely important for the sake of the workers, their families, Bus Éireann and Ireland Inc. in terms of public transport system that there is a speedy resolution which is to everyone's satisfaction, especially for the workers and their families about whom I am concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">Among the heroes that we all pay tribute to these days are the Irish Naval Service personnel who have been involved in unprecedented missions in the Mediterranean as they play a major operational part in assisting migrants in distress. They have been doing so since 2015. Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently conferred the crew of <i>LE Eithne</i> on behalf of the Naval Service with an honorary award in recognition of their humanitarian work abroad. We would all commend that. It is estimated that Irish naval officers have saved the lives of more than 10,000 people in peril at sea. In their difficult search and rescue roles, these personnel have witnessed a lot of human suffering and extensive loss of life. I would like the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, to specify what type of emotional supports these personnel were offered prior to, during and on completion of their tour of duty in the Mediterranean? It is vital for the welfare of these serving officers and for the Permanent Defence Force that cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are diagnosed promptly and all medical resources are provided thereafter. What kind of confidential counselling, psychiatric assistance or other treatments have been offered to naval crew? Were such supports provided by specialists within the Defence Forces or external clinicians? It is essential that pre and post-mission interventions are made to deal with the health risks for personnel as they serve other people in other territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Post-traumatic stress disorder is a very debilitating illness. All measures must be taken to ensure the Naval Service, Air Corps and the Army are cared for appropriately when exposed to crises. A rapid diagnosis of PTSD symptoms by the Permanent Defence Force would also offset any potential personal injury legal actions taken by personnel who witness tragic events in the course of their employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Shortly, 133 soldiers of the 55th Infantry Group will leave for peacekeeping duty with the UN Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan Heights in Syria. The changeover has already taken place. Their rigorous training will equip them for the mission. Like their colleagues in the navy, they may encounter scenes that will challenge them and stay long in their memory when they return home. We need to be assured that they are being well looked after.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">There was a debate a few weeks ago on the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2016. It was agreed that it would go on to the next Stage. It was also indicated by the Minister that the Bill would not be dealt with for at least 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Since that debate, I have received a number of calls from people whose family members are missing, some of them for a number of years. Often, all indications are that the missing person has died but the remains have not been found. In such cases a death certificate cannot be issued. One parent told me that there is clear evidence that his or her family member died more than two years ago but the body was not recovered. I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, asking her to request the coroner to hold an inquest. The Minister has the power to do so. As a result of that letter, the Garda called to the family and took DNA samples from the father to see if the DNA matches with bodies which have been discovered on the coasts of Wales and Scotland with a view to bringing a conclusion for that family. It is sad that it has taken two years for the authorities to take DNA samples to cross-check for a match with bodies discovered on the other side of the Irish Sea. I ask that this matter be taken up with the Minister and that a far more effective system be put in place to avoid delays of two, three or four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> I do not see why we should wait for another 12 months for the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2016 to progress. There is no real cost to the State for implementing the changes but the Bill will bring about changes which will bring conclusions for many families where there is no body discovered or death certificate issued. In the case of the tragedy of the Coast Guard Rescue 116 helicopter off the west coast, the Coast Guard have recently called for the fishing community to help locate the bodies. While I hope that the bodies are recovered, if they are not, those families will have to wait in the same way as other families. It is not right that the families of people who have given a huge contribution to the State should be treated in this way. I ask the Leader to ask the Department of Justice and Equality to progress this Bill and bring it to a conclusion.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I join Senator Ned O'Sullivan in welcoming the introduction in the Lower House of the Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill 2017 by our colleague, Deputy Shane Cassells. Town councils should never have been abolished. The so-called Putting People First document which led to our councils being decimated, particularly in rural Ireland, does not contribute to putting people first. I would very much welcome the re-introduction of town councils to most major towns in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Yesterday and today, Senator Craughwell raised very serious concerns about the Defence Forces. While I am aware that the Leader had scheduled the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, to come to the House a number of weeks ago, that had to be deferred. However, as a matter of urgency, we must have that debate. If possible, the Minister with responsibility for the Defence Forces, the Taoiseach, should be present for that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">This is too serious an issue to be dealt with by a Minister of State. A number of weeks ago, as a result of a terrible tragedy, we found out there are not enough personnel in the Air Corps to fly our planes. In essence, we can only be invaded by appointment. While Senator Craughwell has made the point about a sovereign State allowing the Royal Air Force to fly over our airspace, I understand that is only in the case of an emergency. Unfortunately, the reality is that we have no other option. If there is a hijacked plane heading for the centre of Dublin, who is going to intervene? The sad reality is that by the time we get the personnel who are on standby to Baldonnel, a serious situation could have occurred. That alone is a very serious matter for the Air Corps, not to mention the low morale and depleted numbers in our Army. We need a serious and detailed debate on the situation and I would like to see the Taoiseach here in his capacity as the Minister responsible for the Defence Forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">I thank the Leader for his kind interjection. What I was trying to get across was that the hours councillors work while they are going through a county development plan has to be looked at. What they did last week in Cork County Council was absolutely wrong in so many ways. Over a three-day period they sat for 34 hours. On the last day, they sat for 17 hours, from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m., making one of the most important decisions for Cork and its development. When I was a member of Cork County Council in 2007, we started at 9 a.m. and finished at 6.30 a.m. the following morning. We worked for 21.5 hours straight.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> The Minister has to intervene and put a regulation in place regarding working hours for councillors. It makes no sense that the most important plan that any local authority brings forward, the county development plan, should be put together by people working those extreme hours. One cannot make coherent decisions if one has been working for 17 hours straight. I have had members of the public on to me about this issue. It is a significant issue for the local authority members who have to work those hours, as well as in terms of the decisions they make. This is something they have five years to work on. It is not emergency legislation. It is not thrown upon them. It can be timed and worked out. The Minister with responsibility for local government has to put a regulation in place so that we do not have these exceptional and extreme working hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">Why break the habit of a lifetime? It seems that Sinn Féin Senators are bringing the Leader all the breaking news today. Just a few hours ago, the European Parliament in Strasbourg passed a joint resolution calling for the North to be protected within the Brexit process. We are very glad and proud, not least of the work of Martina Anderson, MEP. Some 516 MEPs voted in favour of that joint resolution. It is clear from the passing of the resolution that Ireland in its entirety does have many friends within the European Parliament. Like the motion passed by the Dáil in February of this year, it is a sign that people want to see Ireland's national interests protected. They want to see the Good Friday Agreement, our economy and our society protected and defended.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Almost all the co-signatories of this resolution were met by Martin McGuinness last year. He underwent a period of intense engagement with European leaders in the Parliament, the Commission and the Council. He made a very strong case, as no-one else could, that the European institutions needed to play a clear and definitive role in defending the Good Friday Agreement and all of its infrastructure. The joint resolution makes clear that there should be a defence of the Good Friday Agreement, that there should be no hardening of the Border, and that there should be consideration for special status.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> We have had the European Parliament today and the Dáil in February calling for special status. I do not seek to come in here to play party politics with the issue. I hope the Leader will take me at my word. I make the case to the Taoiseach through the Leader because it is an important issue which we need to take very seriously. The Government needs to act on this sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I concur with the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Rónán Mullen, in respect of post-traumatic stress disorder and the supports necessary for our Defence Forces. I have first-hand experience of the bravery shown by the navy divers and the Garda underwater unit in Blacksod Bay last weekend, when I spent some time on the <i>ILV Granuaile</i> in a medical capacity. It is vital that we support our Defence Forces in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Yesterday it was confirmed that St. Joseph's psychiatric day centre in Ballaghadereen is to shut temporarily due to staff shortages. This comes in spite of an assurance given to Oireachtas Members by HSE management last October that there were no plans to close any day centre in County Roscommon, and that if a closure was proposed, public representatives would be consulted in advance. This is an issue which my colleagues, Senators Hopkins and Feighan, and indeed Deputy Eugene Murphy have raised before. I understand the HSE has pledged that the centre will reopen on 18 April. However, I am genuinely worried as to the future of the centre in its current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> It is my intention today to praise, commend and applaud the people of Ballaghadereen.

These Syrian people have come through hell, as we can only imagine. The people of Ballaghadereen should be highly commended for their welcoming efforts. I was also very happy to see that an initial €97,000 of health funding is to be allocated to medical resources in Ballaghadereen for the 80 refugees who are to be relocated there. However, that news is entirely blighted now by the closure of the psychiatric day centre. Lest we forget, the Syrian conflict is now the longest ever conflict, outlasting World War Two. What Ballaghadereen needs to become that shining beacon is intensive funding and investment, not cuts and closures.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">This is World Autism Awareness Week. Recent research has shown a huge increase in the incidence of people on the spectrum of autism and Asperger's syndrome. We are one of the few countries that do not have a national strategy for those with autism and Asperger's syndrome. This research, which shows an incidence of one in 70, is a powerful argument for having a look at this and putting in place a strategy. I know it was under consideration previously and that the Department of Health was against it. I would ask the Minister to re-examine this. I would like the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to discuss the need for a national strategy in respect of this issue. I believe it is more prevalent than many of the conditions for which we do have strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">It would send a powerful message to many of those who have this condition and to their families who strive valiantly, day in and day out, to support them and help them. This is a group of people who, with the right support in the early years, can lead hugely productive lives and make a serious contribution to society. Many of the great scientific breakthroughs were made by people who, when one examines their history, were at least on the spectrum, if they did not have Asperger's syndrome or were not autistic. From a natural justice and societal point of view, we need to put in place a strategy to deal with this prevalent condition because as many as one in 70 of our citizens have the condition. I ask the Leader to request the Minister to attend here to discuss the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I want to raise again the issue of the greyhound industry. On Sunday evening I attended a meeting in Tipperary that was attended by 750 greyhound owners or breeders who outlined their concerns about the way the industry is run. The sector will receive €16 million in subsidies this year under the greyhound fund. Despite the subsidy the industry and stakeholders are hugely concerned. First, the Harold's Cross stadium remains for sale. Second, there has been a complete lack of engagement or consultation with the owners and breeders of greyhounds. A greyhound is a poor man's horse. Those people deserve to be listened to, particularly when State subsidies are being made available through the fund referred to, although most of it is collected through the betting tax. At the meeting we heard that a group would seek a meeting with the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I ask the Leader to use his good offices to ensure the meeting occurs, to arrange an early debate in this House on the greyhound industry and to ask the Minister when the greyhound Bill is expected to come before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I wish to refer briefly to the national planning framework. The consultation period ended on Friday and submissions were made to the Department. The framework will underpin where people will live, work and the services they obtain over the next 25 years up to 2040. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate so that Senators can express their opinions on the framework. It is early days, but nonetheless the departmental officials will frame their own thoughts following the submissions made. It might be an opportune time to have a debate in the House either before or after the Easter break.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">I thank the 22 Members of the House who contributed. Senator Ardagh rightly raised the issue of disability services and the need for continued investment and improvement. It is important to acknowledge that a huge amount of work needs to be done in the area of disability. Notwithstanding that, I acknowledge that the parents who took to the streets this week have in some cases justifiable cause and feel frustrated. People are angry about the level of investment, but it is important to recognise that the Government has a plan and given a commitment. The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, sits at the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> In terms of speech and language therapy, the waiting times for assessment and treatment have been significantly reduced due to a targeted programme of investment and a successful waiting list initiative last year. In saying that, it is important to recognise that a huge amount of work remains to be done. As I said yesterday on the Order of Business, the HSE is recruiting and taking people on. One of the key priorities in the 2017 national service plan in terms of the HSE is to improve waiting times for therapy services by changing the model of care. The initiative has proven successful, especially for children who require speech and language therapy. At the same time I recognise that we have difficulties in some of the areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I want to put the following on record for the benefit of Members of the House who do not like to hear good news. As I said yesterday, €4 million has been allocated in the 2016 service plan to facilitate the recruitment of speech and language therapists, thus allowing for 83 additional posts to be provided. All efforts have been made by the HSE to ensure those posts are filled and appropriately placed in accordance with the needs of people in different localities and areas. It is important to recognise that there is investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> As I said yesterday, we have an issue with respite and require a greater model of delivery. Respite care is a source of contention for many of us in the House because it is the most vulnerable who need access to respite care to give their families a break. This issue is not about families going off on a holiday but giving them a break. It is also about giving a care model. Senator Ardagh mentioned respite care, and I hope that we will see a significant change in the current respite care model because there is a need to have that model changed. I am anxious, as I am sure other Senators are, to see that prioritised by the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> Senators Boyhan and Feighan raised the issue of the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Senator Boyhan is right in terms of the issue of acute beds. There needs to be a step-down facility and a greater investment in primary care. The investment plan for the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire must be prioritised and not put on the long finger. I am happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the important issue of diabetes and the challenge it poses to the health system. He is quite right in that. Senator Ray Butler is an example of how one can challenge a diagnosis of diabetes. He deserves great credit for the work he has done, through his own story, to promote the issue of diabetes. There are 225,000 people who live with diabetes in this country and, therefore, it is imperative and critical that services are maintained. I am unfamiliar with the issue raised but Senator Mac Lochlainn might send me a note that I can pass to the Minister. He might also consider tabling a Commencement matter on it because it is an important matter. This is about care of patients, whether by a GP in a primary care setting or in a hospital. There needs to be greater awareness and support given in the context of diabetes. The Senator is right in that and I would be happy to push that with him with the Minister in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Senator Kelleher raised the issue of Cork University Maternity Hospital. It is important to highlight that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at a meeting held in January, gave a commitment to deliver key parts of a service upgrade in the hospital. Senator Colm Burke and I met him on numerous occasions. I welcome very much the appointment of Professor John Higgins as clinical director of CUMH. This week, as the hospital celebrates the tenth anniversary of its opening, the Minister made the significant announcement of the allocation of extra moneys to provide more staff, a one-stop-shop for day care services and the opening of a new theatre. All of these initiatives will lead to better outcomes for women and infants who use the hospital. It is a good news story. The Government is committed to investing in Cork University Maternity Hospital, which I welcome. In terms of Senator Kelleher's Private Members' Bill tonight, I thank all Members for raising the matter. We will see how the debate unfolds.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Senator Byrne raised the issue of the SUSI grant for postgraduates. I welcome the announcement that the initiative will lead to grants being awarded to postgraduate students. As she rightly said, it is about encouraging further education and going beyond the primary degree. We all welcome that. I also join the Senator in congratulating Peter Furey on his award and win in the Doodle for Google competition. It is good to see young people being innovative and creative.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> Senator Davitt raised the issue of the FAI ladies' international football team, something we discussed yesterday on the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I think it is a source of disappointment to all of us seeing the story unfold and listening to the commentary that the team had to hold a press conference yesterday to promulgate its annoyance and its views on the lack of support from the FAI. Perhaps the FAI will contend that there are two sides to every story and that it has made an attempt to intervene and mediate. However, it is important we recognise, as I said yesterday, that these are athletes of the highest calibre performing for our country and they deserve our respect and support. It is important that taxpayers' money is spent on the women's team as well as the men's team.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Senators Craughwell and Wilson again raised the Defence Forces and the issue of the National Security Committee. I reiterate the point I made yesterday. I extended to Senator Craughwell an invitation to meet the Department officials, which still stands. We need to stop playing to the gallery on national security.</p>

Before the State can ratify the convention, a number of pieces of legislation must be enacted and amended. In 2015, the Government published a roadmap signposting the direction we are taking in respect of the legislative measures that need to be met. I refer to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act and the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. It is also important to consider that the Government has appointed Professor Ruane to examine the issue of the employment of people with disabilities. It is equally important that Deputy Finian McGrath sits at the Cabinet table as the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities. This is a priority. The forthcoming budget is the Government's second budget, not its third. At least, I hope I have not missed one.</p>

I think there is a recognition in some quarters that there is a need to examine how we can better govern locally in terms of some towns over a certain population level. Perhaps in hindsight the dissolution of town councils in the manner in which it was done was a regressive move. I am in favour of examining how we might give towns of a certain size or status their town councils back again, but there is a need to examine how we can deliver-----</p>

          <p eId="para_174">We incurred the wrath of his magnificent skill and football prowess on many a sad occasion in Páirc Uí Chaoimh and Fitzgerald Stadium. On a serious note, though, he was an extraordinary footballer with tremendous talent and great skill and I wish him well in his retirement from inter-county football.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Ó Domhnaill yesterday referred to the FAI and the treatment of the women's soccer team. On a positive note, last weekend we had a tremendous day of activity on our sporting fields which showed the importance of sport in our country. I thank all our sportspeople who are, in this case, amateurs playing not for money but for the joy of their club or county and wish them every success in the forthcoming championship season.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of the Bus Éireann dispute, which is on day 13. I join him in welcoming the resumption of talks and hope that it is a pathway to a solution. Public transport is a critical part of our nation and an essential public service. It is interesting to note that Bus Éireann stands to lose €125,000 in funding from the NTA for every weekday it fails to provide services and €75,000 for every Saturday and Sunday. I regret very much the dispute. I had the pleasure of meeting members of the drivers' unions this week in Cork. They do not want to be on strike as it is a huge imposition on them and their families. It is important, whatever one's view on the strike, that we consider how we can get the balance between public services and paying public servants right. This is a matter of public interest, and talks need to be held. Senator O'Donnell is correct that the PSO levy on Expressway services needs to be considered, and a change might have to come to make this about fairness in the way in which Bus Éireann and private operators can compete on the Expressway routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Senators Mullen and Swanick referred to the Defence Forces. The issue of post-traumatic stress disorder is very important and it is important that every support that can be given is given to members of the Defence Forces. I would be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, discuss this in the House. I join the Senators in wishing the troops of the 55th Infantry Group, on behalf of all in the House, every success, safe travels and safe mission when they go to the Golan Heights. As the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, our Defence Forces in their work abroad are tremendous ambassadors for our country. Senator Mullen is right that they have saved thousands of lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">They deserve our praise, thanks and prayers. I hope they will stay out of harm's way. Like Senator Keith Swanick, I pay tribute to the Irish Coast Guard, Defence Forces personnel, including of the Naval Service, voluntary divers, the men and women of many maritime and coastal communities and fishermen who are giving of their time in the search to find the two missing crewmen. I hope their bodies will be returned to their loved ones and families. Although it may embarrass him, I commend Senator Keith Swanick for the role he has played which is the epitome of voluntarism. From talking to members of the Defence Forces and the Irish Coast Guard, I know that he has been a huge tower of strength and a tremendous asset in the search.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">Senator Máire Devine mentioned a High Court case. I have not had a chance to read the judgment. The one third:two thirds ratio is a decision of the courts; the Government and the Oireachtas have no say in the determination of costs. That is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and needs to be considered. However, as Members of the Oireachtas, we cannot be deterred or deflected from taking action to defend the integrity of the Oireachtas and our right to be the voice of the people. The courts have a separate independent jurisdiction. I think the Senator is right, however, and will be happy to ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Colm Burke referred to the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2016, to which he is very attached. He is right. It is a traumatic experience for the families and loved ones of persons who have gone missing. I know from talking to people that whenever the telephone rings or there is a knock on the door, expectation is heightened that there will be news of a loved one or family member who is missing. It is unacceptable and disappointing that there is a delay. I agree with the Senator that there is a need to progress the Bill because we need to have an effective system in place. The length of delay described by the Senator is unacceptable. I will be happy to talk to him again about the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senator Lombard raised the issue of councillors' pay and conditions. It is one on which the Leas-Chathaoirleach has ruled, but I think the Senator is referring to the process involved in considering the county development plan. We all saw what happened in Cork County Council where councillors had to sit for 17 hours to pass a county development plan and understand this can lead to bad decisions and incoherence. It is unfair on councillors and council staff to have to meet for that length of time. I am sure the Senator could have a quiet word with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, about it. The issue needs to be examined because it is significant and the Senator is right to highlight it. </p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Senator Ó Donnghaile referred to the European Parliament joint resolution on Brexit and the decision passed today. It is important that we receive whatever help and support we can in the European Parliament and throughout the European Union. As I said yesterday, we are very fortunate to have someone of the calibre of Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach who is well recognised across the continent of Europe as the leader of the Fine Gael Party which is attached to the European People's Party, EPP. As an example, since the turn of the year over 20 Cabinet-level discussions have taken place on Brexit, there have been 400 engagements with our EU partners and EU institutions, 1,200 representatives have participated in 16 all-Ireland civic dialogue sessions over four months and there have been 300 stakeholder meetings. More importantly, Mr. Tusk and Mr. Juncker are aware and recognise the importance of the island of Ireland. As we all know, the Government has been preparing for the Brexit negotiations. Our priorities have always been to recognise the importance of the Northern Ireland peace process, to minimise the impact of Brexit on trade and the economy, to maintain the common travel area and to influence the future of the European Union. We must all wear the green jersey. The Taoiseach, as head of the Government, has been doing a Trojan job in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Senator Swanick mentioned St. Joseph's in Ballaghaderreen. If he gives me a note on the issue, I will be happy to pass it to the relevant Minister, but it is important that it be raised by way of a Commencement matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> In World Autism Week Senator Reilly referred to the national autism strategy required. I wholeheartedly agree with him. It is essential to have such a strategy. He said the number of people being diagnosed at different levels on the autism spectrum was increasing. There is a need for a comprehensive national strategy not least to ensure family members will be empowered, given a roadmap and access to services but also, as the Senator rightly said, to ensure the children in question can benefit from early intervention and receive treatment. </p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to the greyhound industry and his attendance at a meeting in County Tipperary. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, came to the House for a debate on the industry. There has been a change at the Irish Greyhound Board. Dr. Sean Brady is the interim chief executive officer, but there is a need for change in the management model for the industry. I will be happy to invite the Minister of State to come to the House for a debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> The level of engagement by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government throughout the country on the national planning framework is to be welcomed. Senator Ó Domhnaill is right. It is important architecture for the future and this House should have a role and a say in the matter. I will be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_189">Amendments Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, seek to insert a new Part 4 into the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017 to support the open disclosure of patient safety incidents. Senators will recall that in the course of her Second Stage speech the Tánaiste indicated that such amendments would be brought forward. Accordingly, I am very pleased to propose the amendments for consideration by the House. On behalf of the Minister for Health, I thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health for undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the provisions which was very helpful in ensuring the legislation would be brought forward today as a positive measure that represents an important part of ongoing patient safety initiatives in the health service. There are 20 amendments in total, including a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill. With the agreement of the House, it is my intention to take the amendments in thematic groups which will follow the narrative of Part 4. </p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The first group includes amendments Nos. 1 and 2. </p>
          <p eId="para_191">These introductory amendments seek to amend section 1 to include reference to Part 4 - the new provisions on open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The second grouping is amendments Nos. 3 and 4, which address definitional matters relevant to the new Part 4. The third grouping consists of amendments Nos. 5 and 6. Those amendments detail what an open disclosure is, what its legal effect is and the statement to be prepared by the health service provider in regard to open disclosure. The fourth grouping is amendments Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, 13 and 16, which provide for the steps involved in the open disclosure process, including what happens when a person does not wish to participate in the process or the health service provider cannot get in touch with the patient for the purposes of arranging an open disclosure meeting. The next grouping is amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 15. These amendments cover the requirements for the conduct of the open disclosure meeting and for the provision of further information and clarification of information provided. Amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, will be taken separately. They deal, respectively, with the records to be kept, the making of ministerial regulations, and saving and transitional arrangements when Part 4 is commenced. Amendment No. 20 involves a change to the Long Title of the Bill and is consequential to the other amendments being carried.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Before I deal with the amendments, I would like to take this opportunity to speak about the purpose of Part 4. The provisions to support open disclosure are part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events within the health service. Last December, the Minister for Health launched a new national patient safety office, located in the Department of Health, to prioritise work in this area. He has directed this office to work on a range of initiatives, including new legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the measurement of patient experience, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda. Within the programme of legislation, it is intended to progress the licensing of our public and private hospitals. </p>
          <p eId="para_194"> These reforms also include the provisions on periodic payment orders in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill. While the open disclosure provisions were originally to be included in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, it was thought that they would be a good fit with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, which was more advanced than the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill. Patient safety is fundamental to the delivery of quality health care and to public confidence in the health system, and open disclosure is an integral element of patient safety incident management and learning. Open disclosure is about an open, honest and consistent approach to communicating with patients and families when things go wrong in health care. It includes keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the incident, and it may include, depending on the particular circumstances involved, an apology for what happened. For those reasons, open disclosure is important for building patient and public trust in the health system and it is therefore vital that it should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, chaired by Professor Deirdre Madden, recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection for open disclosure of patient safety incidents to patients. It is envisaged that such legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure. </p>
          <p eId="para_196"> International experts' experience indicates that open disclosure will happen best by fostering the development of an honest and honest culture. In its consideration of these provisions the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health recognised that the best chance of creating the conditions necessary for the success of open disclosure lies in taking a voluntary approach backed up by apology laws. In responding to the committee's observations and in order to properly take account of experience into the future, the Minister for Health has indicated that the structured evaluation of the success of voluntary open disclosure will be undertaken in the future once a suitable period of time has elapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The open disclosure legislative provisions in Part 4 are therefore designed to give legal protections for the information disclosed and any apology made during the open disclosure process but only when the information provided and the apology made is in keeping with the requirements set out in the legislation. The section setting out protections is section 10, while the other sections of Part 4 stipulate requirements on the open disclosure process to ensure that it is an open and patient-centred process. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> These protections address a situation in the health service at the moment where health practitioners could be reluctant to make a disclosure to a patient regarding a patient safety incident because of concerns they may have in regard to the potential consequences it could have for their career as well as the financial implications that may arise with regard to insurance. I wish to be clear, however, that there is no question that the protections being proposed will provide for protections for incompetent, negligent or other unprofessional patient care. Clinicians will still operate within the existing accountability framework, including through the bodies regulating their particular professions. The objective of the legislation is to create a safe place for open disclosure and to encourage the growth of a culture of openness and transparency within our health service, ensuring that patients are getting relevant information when an open disclosure is made. The protections provided will apply in both the public and private sides of the health service so as to support a uniformed system of open disclosure across the health system. </p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I will now deal with the specific amendments. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which are being taken together, amend section 1 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill to insert references to the new Part 4 concerning open disclosure as that part of the Bill will be the responsibility of the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality. The intention is that the commencement of Part 4 would be a matter for the Minister for Health. The Tánaiste has also asked me inform the House that she is considering tabling further amendments on Report Stage in regard to a number of issues related to the periodic payments part of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Section 51O provides that the Part dealing with periodic payment orders will apply to proceedings which are brought on or after the commencement of the Part or in respect of which no final decision has been made on the date of such commencement. The Tánaiste is examining the issue with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that the provisions on periodic payment orders can only apply to cases where a court has already made an internal award and, if necessary, the Tánaiste will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to clarify this matter for Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> The Tánaiste also notes that discussions are under way between her Department, the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Attorney General on the possibility of giving the Personal Injuries Assessment Board the power to make periodic payment orders in catastrophic injury cases. Again, if required, the Tánaiste will bring forward any appropriate amendments and information on Report Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_202"> My Department and the State Claims Agency are preparing comprehensive provisions dealing with recovery of costs, specified health and personal social care services in the cases of persons who are in receipt of periodic payment orders. This is to avoid a situation referred to as double recovery where a person in receipt of the periodic payment order for the purpose of his or her long-term health care need also receives health benefits under, for example, a medical card. It would also be necessary to avoid the situation where, for example, a defendant could seek to reduce the amount of damages payable because of a plaintiff's entitlement to a medical card. The intention is to table the required amendments on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">This is the second group of amendments, amendments Nos. 3 and 4. This grouping is concerned with the definitions surrounding the concept and process of open disclosure in Part 4. Amendment No. 3 inserts section 7, which is the general definitions section for Part 4. Senators will notice that "health service" and "health services providers" have been defined extensively to ensure that the definitions capture the full range of health services providers available in Ireland, both on the public and private sides. Another key definition is "relevant person" which, in relation to a patient, is a person closely connected to the patient who may be present at any open disclosure meeting. The person can be a spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, parent, son or daughter or could be someone the patient has nominated in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Amendment No. 4 inserts section 8, which defines the key concept of "patient safety incident" separately, thus highlighting its importance to the operation of Part 4. The definition follows the accepted international classification and nomenclature used in the World Health Organization Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety. The definition covers three things: the actual adverse events where harm is caused to the patient; no harm events, which are incidents that could have caused harm but did not do so; and near misses, which are outcomes that did not reach the patients but would have caused harm if they had.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I will now focus on the third grouping of amendments. This grouping describes what an open disclosure is for the purposes of the Bill, what its legal effect is and the statement that is to be prepared by health services providers regarding open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Amendment No. 5 inserts section 9 into the Bill, which provides that a disclosure of a patient safety incident made in accordance with the legislation will be considered an open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Amendment No. 6 inserts section 10 into the Bill, which provides for certain protections for open disclosure, which will only be given when all the requirements in the legislation are met. The protections are as follows: information provided, and an apology where it is made, in an open disclosure meeting will not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability in a clinical negligence action regarding that patient safety incident; information provided, and an apology where it is made, in an open disclosure meeting are not admissible as evidence of fault or liability in a clinical negligence action regarding that patient safety incident; and information provided, and an apology where it is made, in an open disclosure meeting are not admissible as evidence of fault in professional fitness to practise proceedings. Section 10 also provides that insurance or indemnity is not affected by an apology made as part of an open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Amendment No. 7 inserts section 11 into the Bill, which provides that a health services provider will prepare a written statement outlining the procedure for making an open disclosure and the restrictions on the use that the patient may make of any information provided and any apology made. I would stress at this point that the patient's medical record will still be fully accessible for use by patients and nothing in Part 4 affects that.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">This grouping sets out the steps in the open disclosure process, from when the health services provider first becomes aware of a patient safety incident to the organisation of the meeting itself, and includes what happens when a patient decides not to take part in the process or if the health services provider cannot get in touch with the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Amendment No. 8 inserts section 12 into the Bill, which provides that a health services provider may make an open disclosure regarding a patient safety incident to a patient and-or his or her relevant person.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Amendment No. 9 inserts section 13 into the Bill, which provides for who makes the disclosure on behalf of a health services provider. It will generally be the principal health practitioner involved in the patient’s care. If the principal health practitioner is unavailable, another health practitioner who the health services provider considers appropriate will make the disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Amendment No. 10 inserts section 14 into the Bill, which deals with the timing of an open disclosure meeting, which should take into the account the circumstances of the meeting, including the desirability of the open disclosure being made as soon as practicable. The meeting can go ahead even if not all of the information is available at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Amendment No. 11 inserts section 15 into the Bill, which provides for matters to be addressed by a health services provider before making an open disclosure. Matters to be addressed include: to whom the open disclosure should be made, whether it should be a patient or a relevant person or both; whether it is appropriate for an apology to be made; taking steps to ensure the information is given in as clear a manner as possible; and designating a person to liaise with the patient regarding the open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Amendment No. 13 inserts section 17 into the Bill, which provides for what happens when a patient or relevant person declines to participate in a proposed open disclosure meeting. It is important to note that there is no obligation on them to agree to participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Amendment No. 16 inserts section 20 into the Bill, which provides for what happens when a health services provider cannot contact a patient to arrange an open disclosure meeting. A health services provider should take all steps reasonably open to them to get in touch with a patient to arrange an open disclosure meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">This group of amendments deals with the open disclosure meeting itself and the subsequent engagement between the health services provider and the patient concerning the patient safety incident that was the subject of the open disclosure in terms of the provision of further information or clarification of information already provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Amendment No. 12 inserts section 16 into the Bill, which provides for the open disclosure meeting itself, specifying what information must be provided at the open disclosure meeting as well as the manner in which that information and, where appropriate, an apology is to be made and specifying that a statement in writing containing the information provided must be given to the patient or relevant person.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Amendment No. 14 provides for a situation where further information may become available after the open disclosure meeting. The amendment inserts section 18 into the Bill, which provides for the provision of any new information, given pro-actively by the health services provider to the patient and or relevant person. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Amendment No. 15 takes into account a situation which is likely to arise where a patient may have questions following an open disclosure meeting. The amendment inserts section 19 into the Bill, which provides for how requests for clarification of information already provided by the health services provider are to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> The protections inserted under amendment No. 6 also apply to clarification of information and further information provided under the sections inserted by amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">Amendment No. 20 amends the Long Title of the Bill to include the open disclosure provisions. It is a necessary consequential amendment. I hope that Senators will agree that these new provisions are timely and important. As Members of the House will be aware, Ireland's patient safety record has been compromised by a number of high-profile events and reports over the last three years which have affected public confidence in the health service. We have also seen that on occasions, patients and their families have felt unsupported by the system, have not been afforded adequate explanations following adverse events or have found the health service complex to navigate. These provisions mark a major step forward in creating a different mindset within the health service. Through the creation of a culture of open disclosure and emphasising the need to learn from the things that go wrong, we will see a safer health service emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents. HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are at an advanced stage of development of standards on the conduct of reviews of patient safety incidents which expand on the national standards for safer and better healthcare. This set of standards, along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents. Delivery of health care is inherently risky. While it is inevitable that things will go wrong, there is much that can be done to prevent harm or error, identify and act on when it occurs and to learn from this to improve services.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> As I have outlined earlier the provisions for open disclosure form part of the broad and ambitious programme of patient safety reforms being progressed by the Minister for Health. This programme of reform is aimed at a whole systems approach to improving patient safety.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_234">I am delighted to be in this House to introduce the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017. With the support of Senators I hope it will be possible to have it enacted as soon as possible. As I mentioned in the Lower House, I feel I am part of a relay team. I acknowledge the role of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the then Minister of State, now Senator Ó Ríordáin, in particular for moving this issue forward and the many others who have worked for years to get the concept of an injecting centre in Ireland off the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Last autumn injection centres opened in Paris and Lisbon and a centre will open shortly in Glasgow. There is a problem with injecting on the streets of Dublin and other cities and towns in Ireland. I have seen it on my own doorstep. Many Deputies have spoken in the Dáil about seeing parents and children observing this on their way to school. I am sure many Senators in this House have witnessed street injecting. It is unhygienic and unsafe. Those injecting on the street are at risk of contracting disease, such as hepatitis C and HIV. They risk getting ulcers and other infections. They are at risk of death from overdose. The wider community and the public are also at risk due to needles and syringes left behind. We need a new approach to tackling the problem. While I am not saying that the injection centres are the solution to the public injecting problem, there is evidence to support that they contribute to a significant improvement by reducing public health risk, overdose and improving public areas. Supervised injection centres exist in a number of other countries. These centres are aimed at the hard to reach population of drug users and are based in locations where there are significant problems of public drug use. The aim is to reduce the risk of disease and death linked with public injection and to provide access to health and treatment services. They provide a controlled place where people can inject, but much more than that, they provide a place to rest and have a chat and to access the services people need.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I believe in a health-led and person-centred approach to the drug problem. This is all about people and looking after the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society. The human cost of injecting in public is clear and keeps adding up in terms of the lack of dignity and the effect it has on a person's health, well-being and safety. We know that these centres are not the sole solution to the drugs problem and many other steps are needed, but I am committed to doing everything we can to help those who need it most.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> In the programme for Government we have made a commitment to a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drug use. First and foremost, injection centres are intended to be a form of harm reduction. If people are going to take drugs, they should be informed about the risks, they should be able to do so as safely as possible, and they should know what to do if something goes wrong. Together with needle exchange, overdose education and a supply of Nalaxone, injection centres and other tools help to reduce the risk of harm to people who inject drugs. Harm reduction interventions like those do not prevent people from choosing to stop taking drugs. While they do not stop people from engaging with treatment in the future, they may give the service users the chance to live long enough to seek treatment when they are ready to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> There is currently significant debate about national and international drug related matters. Many such matters will be examined as part of the new national drugs strategy which is at an advanced stage of drafting. However, they should not deter us from the goal of this Bill. The sole purpose of this Bill is to permit the provision and use of an injection centre. For us to open a pilot supervised injecting centre, we need this Bill. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, it is currently an offence to provide an injection centre. Service users would also be guilty of several offences. A change to the existing law is required to permit the introduction of this service.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The Bill contains 13 sections and I will explain each section in turn. Section 1 deals with the interpretation. The provision is standard and includes a number of new definitions for the purpose of the Bill. The section includes definitions for drug licence and supervised injection facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The definition of "drug" will include controlled drugs and psychoactive substances, sometimes referred to as "head shop" drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Sections 2 and 3 cover application for a licence and the granting of a licence. Section 2 provides for the information that should be included in an application. This will include the name and relevant experience of the person applying for a licence and the address of the proposed premises. The application should include details of the operational and clinical governance arrangements for the proposed centre, which includes proposed wraparound services and referral pathways. If an application does not contain enough detail, the Minister can seek further information. Section 3 provides the criteria the Minister should consider when granting a licence. These include, but are not limited to, consultation with An Garda Síochána, the HSE and others as the Minister considers appropriate. They also include the matters the HSE will consider when advising the Minister on the appropriateness of an application. The HSE is best placed to assess the clinical governance and operational protocols proposed for a premises and to ensure it is fit for purpose. In addition, there will be consideration of whether the location of a proposed centre is appropriate given the level and nature of drug use in any area. The HSE will advise the Minister accordingly in such a case. In this way, a centre will be located based on need in areas where there is a significant public injecting problem. Section 3 also grants the Minister the authority to attach conditions to a licence. Licences will be for a fixed length of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Sections 4 to 6, inclusive, deal with the surrender, suspension and transfer of a licence. These sections provide for a licenceholder to be able to surrender or to seek to transfer a licence for a particular centre. Written notice of a fixed period must be provided to the Minister before a centre can be closed. These provisions ensure that adequate service provision continues should the effectiveness of a centre remain positive. Section 5 provides for the Minister to revoke or suspend a licence with immediate effect based on the input of the Garda or the HSE should there be a serious and immediate risk to life. Under this section, the conditions attached to a licence may be changed or added to, as the Minister sees fit, taking into account the views of the HSE, An Garda Síochána and others. Section 6 allows for the transfer of a licence for a premises to another licenceholder to maintain the service if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Section 7 provides the definition of an "authorised user". It also provides the authority of a licenceholder to permit a person to be in an injecting centre. An "authorised user" will be an individual who is on the premises of the injecting centre in accordance with the conditions of the licence and with the permission of the licenceholder. A person cannot be an authorised user outside of the centre. The status of the authorised user will depend on the permission of the licenceholder or person in charge at the time. Therefore, a service user who has been asked to leave the premises or who will be in breach of the conditions of the licence will not be exempt from certain offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The eligibility of a person to become an authorised user refers to regulations that may be put in place to prevent the use of the centre by certain groups of people, for example, those under 18 years of age, those who are not chronic intravenous, IV, drug users and those who are pregnant. The making of any such regulations should be informed by clinical practice. Appropriate referral resources are expected to be put in place for anyone who presents to a centre but is not considered suitable to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Section 8 provides for unidentified data to be shared with the Minister or the HSE for the purposes of evaluating the centre. Personal records cannot be shared.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Section 9 provides an exemption for the licenceholder, or any person acting under the direction of the licenceholder, from liability for providing an injecting centre and any assistance, advice or care given to an authorised user.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Section 10 provides that certain sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 will not apply under certain circumstances. Section 3 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence to be in possession of a controlled drug. The offence of possession of a controlled drug would not apply to an authorised user as defined under section 7 of this Bill. Section 19 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence to do certain things with a controlled drug on premises. The licenceholder for an injecting centre will be exempted from such an offence. Finally, section 21 of the 1977 Act makes it an offence to break or fail to comply with the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. This section of the Bill ensures authorised users will not be in breach of the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Section 11 relates to provision of access for An Garda Síochána. This section provides for a member of the Garda to enter an injecting centre without a warrant for the prevention or detection of offences. It is not intended that the Garda will be continually in a centre watching over authorised users. It is normal practice for police in other countries to call into injecting centres regularly. This offers peace of mind to the authorised users, the staff and the wider community and ensures no one can attempt to profit through dealing or preying on vulnerable drug users in the centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Section 12 provides for the Minister for Health to make various regulations for the purposes of the Bill, and section 13 covers the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions. These are standard provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> I am pleased to bring forward the Bill. It is a compassionate and practical response to the chilling reality of drug users injecting and overdosing in public. I hope all in the House will fully support it and help ensure its smooth passage through the Seanad.</p>

        <speech by="#KeithSwanick" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Senator Keith Swanick<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_250">In the words of Deputy Michael Harty, "The aim of this piece of legislation is to provide for the licensing of supervised injecting facilities in order to enhance the dignity, health and wellbeing of those who inject in public places." Fianna Fáil supports this Bill, which would introduce supervised injection facilities. It is designed to avoid drug-induced deaths. It is obviously not the sole answer to the drug scourge we have. The Government will have to increase funding to detox centres to allow people who want to tackle their addictions to get the support required. Increased investment in education is also much needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I understand some of the legitimate reservations raised, but the centres should provide safe space for drug users to help ensure they use clean needles and dispose of them properly. At present, people are injecting on street corners across Dublin city and, as such, measures to tackle this, even in the short term, must be piloted. We want to see regular reviews, including feedback from stakeholders, undertaken to measure the Act's success if passed. For too long we have invested taxpayers' money in schemes which do not work and which are a waste of money while being of no benefit to the user. This Bill must not turn out this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Ireland has the highest proportion of intravenous heroin users in Europe, and the rate of drug related deaths in Ireland is three times higher than the European average. This is a shocking statistic which again leads me to call for greater investment in education and detox centres. A supervised injection centre must be a gateway to effective treatment, rehabilitation and intervention aimed at harm reduction for those suffering from addiction. This cannot be another Band-Aid on a failing health service. The injecting rooms should be based in centres and as part of a network of services and supports so that they facilitate early intervention and offer a pathway to recovery for drug users. The centres, if successful in tackling drug related harm, have the potential to become a longer-term viable public health measure which seeks to provide a safe and supervised space for people to deal with their addictions. Nonetheless, this is only one part of a solution to the overall drug problem in Dublin in particular. However, it has the potential to be a part of that answer so that, at the very least, individuals ravaged by addiction have the opportunity to retain some dignity while we work to try to help them beat their terrible addictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Notwithstanding my comments, I have liaised with many people involved in this sector, including Councillor Frankie Keena, who is based in Athlone and who has done much voluntary work over the past 20 years in the Athlone and Westmeath region. He highlighted some very valid concerns, one of which is whether this legislation would effectively legalise the possession of heroin within the four walls of these centres. The Act states that if a service provider identifies an area that needs such a centre, the Minister has the power to decide where the centre goes and there is no provision for consultation with elected members of local authorities or the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> My other concern is the staffing of these centres. What if, God forbid, a service user overdoses and dies in such a centre? What emergency facilities will be in place? How will staff members be protected from a medical and legal viewpoint? This issue must be teased out further. Finally, it is somewhat disconcerting that we are almost dependent on drug pushers, and the criminality associated with that, to feed this service.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I hope these valid concerns can be explored on Committee Stage. We are not ruling out proposing further amendments to the legislation.</p>

          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_256">I thank the Minister for bringing this legislation forward. I pay tribute to her for her five years of work in the health committee under the previous Administration. I am aware of her commitment to this issue and I appreciate the work she has done. I also pay tribute to Senator Ó Ríordáin who did a huge amount of work on this when he was a Minister of State. I thank him for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> This legislation is the correct way to deal with this issue. It will provide protection for people who are injecting drugs. It is about trying to provide some support for those people and to protect them from contracting other infections and diseases. It is an appropriate way to deal with it. It will not be easy to establish the system initially but once it is up and running it will provide clear evidence of its benefit not only to the people who are, unfortunately, drug users but also to the wider community. We have much work to do in this area. Senator Swanick is right about education, both in secondary schools and universities, to try to reduce the number of people who get involved with drugs. It will not be easy but we must put more effort into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> One of my concerns, and the Minister referred to it in her contribution, is the authorised users and those under 18 years of age, those who are not chronic intravenous drug users or those who are pregnant. This arose in the health committee previously. When somebody is pregnant and on drugs it causes a problem when the baby is delivered. A number of children are going into detoxification after they are born. I am not sure that we have done enough work in that area in terms of giving support to girls and women who are pregnant and are on drugs. Due to using the drugs for a long period of time they are unable to get off them during their pregnancy. It is not clear that we provide enough support for them. Perhaps the Minister would deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Section 8 of the Bill provides for unidentified data to be shared with the Minister and the HSE. It is important that it is unidentified so the people using the facility do not feel at risk. However, it is important that we monitor this and get appropriate data to help us devise and further develop services.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The other issue is the risk for the licence holder. That is appropriately dealt with in section 9 to ensure there is no legal liability for the licence holder. This means we will not restrict somebody from applying for a licence when he or she can offer appropriate facilities and appropriate supervision in the facilities. We have a long road to travel in this area. What is happening in Dublin is beginning to happen in Cork. Needles are being found in the side streets near one of the methadone clinics. Obviously it means that the methadone facility is used as the centre where people make contact. My concern is that where there is an injecting facility, and there is a facility established in Dublin, there will also be a higher risk of dealers being attracted to the immediate area. It is something that should be considered. I raised it with Senator Ó Ríordáin earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Can we put legislation in place which would provide for a higher penalty for anybody who is found dealing drugs within a particular radius of such a facility? I am not sure if that is possible but it is something we should consider. I realise it will not deter dealers or move them away, but at least it would be an additional mechanism to discourage people from using the injecting facility as a location to deal. The same could apply to areas near methadone facilities. We should examine whether that is covered by existing legislation and, if necessary, bring forward amending legislation. It might even be something we could include in this legislation. Perhaps the Department would consider that suggestion. The people who will be attending these facilities are already under pressure and they will be under additional pressure if dealers are openly assembling in the immediate area of the facilities. It is something that might be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I welcome the Bill. It is the appropriate way of dealing with this issue. However, we have much work to do and this is just one step in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_263">I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome the legislation and I commend Senator Ó Ríordáin for pushing it forward. It is a first step in moving away from treating addiction as a criminal matter and towards treating it as a public health issue. The most recent data available from the national drugs-related death index show that almost two people died each day in 2004 because of poisoning, trauma or medical causes linked to drug use or misuse. Almost 700 people died 2014 and a similar number was reported in 2013. We can deduce, therefore, that two people die each day, which is an epidemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The aims of injecting centres are to reduce the acute risk of disease transmission through unhygienic injection, to prevent drug-related overdoses and deaths and to connect high risk drug users with addiction treatment and other relevant health and social services. These aims are all health related. Addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. I have nothing but compassion for those who are suffering due to drugs. I will return to this point later. If ours is to be a society that helps and is all-encompassing for people who suffer in this way, we should provide a health-based response to the drug problem, not a judgment-based criminal response. Is this legislation good for the overwhelming majority of ordinary Josephine and Joe Soaps who are not drug addicts? I believe it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> First, I will address the positive impact these centres will have on the families of addicts. Having an addict in the family can be agonising. There is constant anxiety and worry about the person's health, well-being, estrangement, behaviour and his or her impact on other family members. The centres will assist in alleviating some of this worry. If addicts are getting access to services that will protect their physical health and also create a starting point for recovery for them, their families will give a small sigh of relief. Families should not have to carry the worry of an addict alone. If we move towards a health-based response, as this legislation does, we are showing them that we view their family member as somebody who deserves help, rather than somebody they must cover up for and carry alone in isolation and embarrassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Second, it is a public health issue to have drug users injecting in public places. We all experience rightful disgust when needles are left in places such as parks and schools where they could infect the public and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">At least four children I know of have needed health monitoring and tests after playing with blood-filled syringes and needles, thinking they were toys because they had seen them so often. They have had to undergo in-depth six-month blood tests for HIV, hepatitis C and other infections.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> The drug injection centres would address this very serious problem and would also treat addicts with the same compassion with which we treat everybody else who has an illness. I heard earlier, at the briefing held by Senator Ó Ríordáin, that in Sydney, Australia, there was a huge reduction in the cost and impact of public drug use once a supervised injection centre was opened. We are not being pioneers here and we know this approach works.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> I said in my opening remarks that I believe the movement towards treating drugs as a health problem should be welcomed. In my time as a psychiatric nurse, I have had vast experience of people who suffer both a mental health issue and an addiction issue. In fact, the two are closely linked. I am hosting two events in my constituency in the coming months on the treatment of dual diagnosis which will shed light on the link between mental ill health and drug addiction. A study by the UK Department of Health put the figures at 75% of users of drug services and 85% of users of alcohol services who also experienced mental health problems. The link between addiction and mental health illness is very real and very important, and it is not something we can ignore. There is a lot of shame, distrust and stigma around both mental illness and addiction. If these centres can be compassionate, non-judgmental places, then maybe we can break through this distrust, shame and stigma, revolutionise the treatment of dual diagnosis and give people hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> I have one reservation about the legislation and it follows from a discussion I had with a worker in my local area. As the Minister of State knows, the area of Rialto has been destroyed in parts by generational drug addiction. It is coming around now but workers on the ground have questions in regard to trust and how gardaí will engage with these centres. Under section 11 of the legislation, gardaí are permitted to be on the premises without a warrant for the detection of offences other than those to supply under section 10. Presumably this is to prevent persons dealing on site or other offences. However, as we know, these centres will be staffed by a mixture of social care personnel. As is best practice in other projects, the worker from my constituency believes it should be up to the centre staff to engage gardaí if needed. Having a situation where gardaí can drop in and keep an eye on people will deter many users from accessing the centre. In this worker's words, what is the point of the service then?</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Supervised injection centres are not the be-all and end-all of treating drug addiction but they are a welcome first step towards treating addiction as a public health issue. I am encouraged to hear there will also be counselling and intervention services. However, I believe these centres need consistent reviewing and monitoring, particularly after the pilot but also into the future, to ensure it is not a case of, "There you are. There's your centre. Be quiet. Inject in peace and leave us alone, and we will all just forget about each other." Instead, these centres should be used as a piece of the puzzle that is needed to treat addiction and, hopefully, we can move forward to become communities that do not suffer at the hand of this disease and the stigma around it. I look forward to the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. Agreeing on locations is another job of work for public representatives and local authorities but let us get this legislation through as a starting point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LynnRuane" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Senator Lynn Ruane<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_272">I will start by providing Senator Colm Burke with a solution to drug dealers that is not a penalty and I would be happy to work with him on it. That solution is the possibility of prescribing in heroin injection centres to do away with the problem, although we are probably a few decades away from that idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I welcome this legislation hugely on a personal and a professional level. I remember that I first started looking into the possibility of supervised injection rooms during the first ever drugs work I did with young heroin users in Cushlawn. What alarmed me most then was when one of the lads came looking for me when he could not bring around one of his friends after he had injected. When I got there, rang the ambulance and put him in a recovery position, I noticed cigarette burns all over him. I asked the lads how he had got burned and found out that, for some reason, there was a culture which meant that if people overdosed in company, others would stick a cigarette in their hand so that it shocked them and woke them up.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> This was the level of education and understanding at the time around addiction. Young people were resorting to all sorts of made-up ideas of what they should do to protect their friends or to bring them out of an overdose. They often did not ring an ambulance for fear the Garda would come as a result of that historical negative relationship that exists between the Garda and drug users. That is why the one part of the Bill I am concerned about, much like Senator Devine, is around the access of gardaí to the centre due to that historical relationship between young people, drug users and gardaí. I wonder how we can begin to mend some of those relationships so that people will not be afraid to use the centre, especially if they have a warrant or an outstanding charge which might impact on them using the service. So many homeless people do not make it to the courts or to their probation appointments and there will be bench warrants issued for them, and so on. If they know a garda can access the centre, will that put them off using it? This is not to say gardaí will in any shape or form abuse that. It is more the perception of the authorised user that they could access it. As someone who has worked in homeless services for a long time and who has had to deal with the issue of drug dealing, I know the staff are very quick to respond to any sign of drug dealing within a homeless service. I ask that something be done to ensure we encourage some sort of communication between the Garda and the people who run the service before gardaí gain access. This would mean we would not damage any further the relationship between drug users and the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Obviously, this is an area I have worked on for a long time. I will conclude as I think the other speakers have hit the main points. When I first looked into the issue of supervised injection in 2000, I thought it would never happen and that there was no point in pursuing it. I remember meeting a researcher, Tim Bingham, who now works for the HSE and who had done a lot of work on this. When I met him a few years later, I still thought it was so far out of reach that we would never achieve it. What I most want to do is commend and compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on taking this on and running with it. It is a great honour to be able to stand here in the Chamber as someone who has worked on addiction and who has been affected by addiction in a million different ways throughout my whole life. It is great to watch this legislation go through the House. I thank the Minister of State for that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_276">Like Senator Ruane, I find it difficult not to be emotional while speaking on this Bill in this Chamber along with Senator Ruane, Senator Kelleher, who has worked in the homeless services in Cork, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who has been so supportive of this legislation. We have people from the Ana Liffey trust in the Visitors Gallery, including Marcus Keane and Tony Duffin, who have spearheaded the campaign for this legislation for quite a long time. I had the Minister of State's role in the previous Government, as she knows. When I first came across the Ana Liffey project and listened to the humanity of what they were trying to achieve, it was very difficult to find any logical reason this city and country would not pursue what other cities and countries have pursued. This is not, as others have said, a pioneering facility and, in fact, there are 88 such facilities across Europe, as well as one in Sydney and others in North America.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The fundamental point is that these facilities will save lives. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe. We have people today injecting in alleys in the open air, which is extremely dangerous. They are liable to contract any type of blood-borne disease, such as hepatitis C or HIV, but they are also likely to die. This reality was brought home to me during the 1916 commemorations when there were two deaths of young men in Dublin city centre within a stone's throw of the GPO, one, ironically enough, in the toilets of Connolly Station, where a young man overdosed and died, and another young man overdosed and remained for two nights in Foley Street in the north inner city. It did not make the news at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Nobody noticed because nobody cared because, on some level, Irish society has decided it is their own fault. We have a mentality of victim-blaming when it comes to heroin overdose or heroin use. The different types of media reporting is remarkable; if a student dies as a result of taking a pill in a nightclub, all the commentary will be about the future that young person could have had and why politicians are not doing more. However, if someone dies of an overdose in a toilet in Dublin or in Cork, there will not be one column inch or one report about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> There are some journalists who need to be congratulated for the way they have supported this Bill - Stuart Clarke from <i>Hot Press </i>and Cormac O'Keeffe from the <i>Irish Examiner </i>were both very supportive of this initiative. However, there have been others in the Irish media who continually dehumanise and degrade those in addiction, using terminology which dehumanises them and undermines them. They perpetuate this problem and they will misrepresent what we are trying to do in this Chamber. </p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I want to congratulate people from the Minister of State's own party, including Deputies Paschal Donohoe, Leo Varadkar and Frances Fitzgerald, who backed this idea from the beginning. I also congratulate people from my own party such as Deputy Joan Burton, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien from Sinn Féin who was very supportive of this from the very beginning, Independent Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, and Deputy Jack Chambers from Fianna Fáil, who made a submission in support to the national drugs strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> This initiative will save lives. On that basis I do not see how anybody can logically have any issue with it. Obviously the regulations will have to be investigated carefully. For many people it is a jump into a radical new way of thinking when it comes to drug policy. However, I would ask anyone who has a question about this if it was their brother or sister - because it is someone's brother or sister - or if it was their father, mother or child, where would they want them to inject if they were sucked into hopeless addiction. Would it be behind a skip or in a toilet, or in a facility which is surrounded by services in a compassionate and safer manner? That is the question. Nobody has ever died in an injecting centre anywhere in the world. It is the first step on the road to recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> This will fail if all we give people is a room to inject. It has to be a suite of services so people will be able to take that first step on the road to recovery. It is remarkable that no matter where I go, people quietly approach me. They tip me on the shoulder and thank me for what I have done on injecting centres, saying their son or their brother had died of an overdose, but they are ashamed to say it. If this was any other health issue we would have a packed Gallery here, there would be a rally outside because people want to give voice to the fact that people are literally dying on the streets. However, they do not do it over heroin overdoses because we have continually managed to dehumanise this debate and blame the victim. </p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I congratulate the Minister of State for taking this on and internalising it and driving it forward. I am so proud to stand here with other people in this Chamber who are making this happen. There are other parts of the country crying out for a centre of this nature but this is a good, decent thing we are doing today. Sometimes it is not easy in politics to stand up for the person who is most vulnerable, who will be demonised and dehumanised in Irish media and often in politics as well. Today politics is actually standing up for that individual. Lives will be saved and the Minister of State is to be commended for that. I cannot wait until this legislation is passed and we can have a centre that is open and we realise that all of us collectively were right in pursuing that, and I am sure that it will be the first of many. I congratulate the Minister of State and support her 100% in the passage of this Bill.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_284">I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate her and the Government for its vision. I also pay my compliments to Senator Ó Ríordáin. I remember him speaking very passionately about this in the House when he was Minister of State. I myself have spoken about it on many occasions. Some 25 years ago I advocated the legalisation of opioid drugs and rather curiously, I was supported in that by the late Deputy, Dr. John O'Connell, who was then Fianna Fáil spokesman on health. We have come a long way since those days.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> I have three comments on the Minister of State's speech. First, as with other colleagues, I completely welcome the Government decision that this should be a health-led rather than a criminal matter. It should never have been a criminal matter. As I recall, anti-drug legislation was first introduced in the early 20th century at the instigation of the pharmaceutical companies so it has a rather dubious background. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> The Minister of State says regarding section 3 that there should be consultation with the Garda, the HSE and so on about the granting of licences. It may lead to some friction, but I would also suggest that it would be good policy to also include local communities and bring them along in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Finally, the legislation excludes people who are under the age of 18, those who are not chronic intravenous drug users, which is okay, and those who are pregnant. I understand the difficulties in dealing with people who are underage or who are pregnant but if we look at the reality, they are probably going to get the drugs - in fact, I guarantee they will - and they are going to inject them somewhere. We need to look very carefully at that. There may be legal reasons particularly for those under 18, I do not know, but if people are taking drugs, if they are chronic intravenous drug users, whether they are under 18 years or pregnant, if they are going to do it anyway, surely it is better that they do it in a decent facility. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> I remember an experiment many years ago. I think in both cases they were done by Catholic priests, one in Rotterdam and the other in Liverpool, where they introduced injection facilities in the crypt of their churches. Criminal activity in the local area dropped by 80% but then some do-gooder went and reported it to Maggie Thatcher who was around at the time and of course it was slammed down and shut to the detriment of people living in that area. </p>
          <p eId="para_289"> These drug injecting facilities should not all be located in the north inner city. This is not NIMBY-ism, it is just that our back yard is full to bursting, we have so many of these kinds of centres already. I think they should be shared out proportionately although I do, of course, recognise-----</p>

          <p eId="para_292"> I do understand that where there are concentrations of drug addicts that is where the centres need to be. Supervision is vital. It has to be made clear that drug peddlers should be cleared out of the immediate vicinity. That is one of the problems we have in my area. I very rarely see anyone injecting. I do not often see that many needles and so on, but I sure as hell see the drug peddlers clustering like seagulls around the facilities for people who are addicted to drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> These provisions will lead to a substantial decrease in deaths among these unfortunate people because the dosages will be measured and the purity will be assessed so they will be getting decent drugs. Then there is the question of clean needles which is vital because people do pass on HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated needles so that will also be very largely eliminated. </p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I am very glad to have been able to speak on this Bill to strongly support the Minister of State and to compliment the Government on its courage and vision in introducing this kind of legislation.

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_295">I thank the Minister of State for bringing this important legislation before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">We reflect upon the nature of legislation, and when people ask about the role of Government and the work of the Oireachtas, today is a good example. I commend Senator Ó Ríordáin on his work as a Minister of State in beginning this process. The Minister of State referred to a relay race but I should also mention the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, for the work he did. It is easy for us to be speaking here today because whether we are candid about this or not, we know we need a new approach to tackling the problem of drug and alcohol misuse. I acknowledge the people in the Gallery today and the work they do. I have met them. When I was Chairman of the Committee on Health and Children, we did some work in this area and our first report was on this area. I highlight the work done in Cork by the Tabor Group and by the Cork local drugs and alcohol task force. As Senator Norris said, people will get drugs and inject. The Minister of State was very honest when she said the injecting centre will not be the solution. It is not a panacea.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> We must reflect on best practice internationally too. The Minister's speech, the report from the Oireachtas Library and Research service and other contributions cite a host of cities around the world. I agree, however, with Senator Ó Ríordáin that this aims to save people's lives and to humanise the problem. We cannot, as a society or government, despite what some might think, create different types of people. We are all human beings, and wherever we live, we are entitled to the same access to treatment and supports. We must put it in that context. I have spoken to people in Cork and others around the country who work at the epicentre and deal with drug misuse and its associated problems, and I am certain we have their support. Like many of her predecessors, the Minister of State is travelling the country and was in Cork recently where she spoke and listened to people. The function of the national drugs misuse strategy is to engage with stakeholders. They are the people who work day in, day out, trying to highlight, solve the problems of, and work with people who misuse drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> Regardless of whether we like it, people will inject in public and in unsafe places. I know many places in my city where that is a problem. We need to tackle that. Senator Ó Ríordáin is right about the health issue. That is why when the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was Chairman of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and I chaired the Committee on Health and Children, we held a joint meeting of our committees on the issue of drug misuse because it was not a question of justice or of punishing or capturing the drug addict or the person who injects but of ensuring a holistic, whole-of-Government approach to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> I am pleased the local drugs task force in Cork is supportive of this. It is a pilot scheme which can be rolled out in other areas because we need to ensure that medically supervised injecting centres are provided. It is not a question of airbrushing or pushing people out to the margins but of ensuring those who are isolated and vulnerable and do not necessarily want to be associated with or come forward to be helped have an environment where they can be helped, reached out to, and worked with towards treatment. I was very pleased the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, turned a sod on Fellowship House, which will be another important asset in Cork in the treatment of people with problems arising from misuse of drugs and alcohol. It is a whole-of-community approach. We need to ensure we have residential detox and rehabilitation beds, in particular for polydrug users.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> This is a good day. Many deserve credit for their courage. This will not be universally popular but we are doing the right thing and that is why all of us in the House must support the Minister of State. I am glad she is the person piloting this in the Oireachtas because she has empathy and sincerity and works at the coalface in her community. She does not have an arsenal of degrees but she has the worthwhile attribute of being a person who listens, who enjoys common sense and wants to see the right thing done.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">I commend the courage of the Government, Senator Ó Ríordáin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, led and inspired by people working on the front line from Ana Liffey. I also speak from my experience of eight years working for the Cork Simon Community. It is above all a matter of dignity. It is bad enough to have an addiction but for a person to have to crawl into a grubby undignified space in a public zone to take a substance which is not going to be great for him or her but which his or her body needs and is unable to do without it, and for that person possibly to die in that place, friendless and without help, is not something that any civilised society should tolerate. It is a first step towards addressing this difficult problem which very often was not created today or yesterday. It often affects people let down by their families or the State, people leaving care. The next step in their difficult lives is to be injecting in a public space in front of us all. This is above all a question of dignity but it also offers hope and possibility for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> The pilot will be in Dublin but this needs to be considered in Cork. We are being grown up in Dublin but we need to be grown up in other places. We should have many locations rather than one big place that everybody gets het up about, as it were, and that is a honeypot for dealers and others. I commend Senator Devine's solution that it is a voluntary corps in the Garda. I think Senator Ruane would also support that.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> I fully endorse this Bill. It is another aspect of Ireland growing up and facing up to its challenges, offering dignity and hope to people who have often been let down but also seeing light at the end of the tunnel. I commend all present and this important legislation.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_304">I feel inadequate. Listening to the contributions and over recent months I have learnt that there are many people who know about addiction and who have witnessed family members struggling with their addiction. There are many who, sadly, have lost loved ones because of addiction. This Bill brings forward a new beginning for people, particularly chronic users. It is clear from the programme for Government, which Senator Ó Ríordáin would be familiar with because it happened in his time, that the Government wants this to be a health-led rather than a criminal justice-led approach to supervised injection facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> There are difficulties whenever something new and different is introduced, especially this. Several contributors have spoken about An Garda Síochána and its role. From my experience of speaking to people in other countries, particularly having visited Copenhagen before Christmas, the role of the police in a supervised injection facility is very much monitored by the people running it. They invite the police in. That is what we are considering. It is an illegal drug, inside or outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Therefore, An Garda Síochána has the right, if it wishes, to enter the building if it suspects that someone is entering it for reasons other than those for which he or she should enter it. From considering the services available in Dublin in particular, I have always been of the understanding that An Garda Síochána has a pragmatic approach to people using services, whether clean injection facilities, Merchants Quay Ireland, the Ana Liffey Drug Project or any others, and that gardaí out on the beat are the people who know who the addicts and dealers are. They see them daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> In this regard, the policing of a service such as an injecting facility is very important. It is important that there be that respect for the Garda and the people using such services, that visits to injection centres be carried out in an appropriate way and that people will not be arrested on premises simply because they are there. They go into the centre to use their drugs because of their illness - and it is an illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> In this regard, I agree with Senator Devine, who has much more experience talking about mental health than I would ever have. Many of us have seen in our families, whether immediate or wider, people who have mental health issues or addiction issues. Most of all, what we need to do - and a number of people have said this and I have said it myself in the past - is to treat people as human beings because that is what they are. We are all citizens of this country. We all deserve certain rights, and sometimes people who are labelled as addicts do not have those rights. They are seen as misfits in society, people who brought it upon themselves and people who do not deserve services.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> If the Bill is passed, as I hope it will be, it will shed a different light on people who are chronic users. There are huge difficulties regarding where the centres will be located and there will be as we go forward. When the Bill is passed and the services go out for tender, it is my understanding that there will be consultation, as there must be. There is no point in having it now because we do not know where the centres will be located. If we have consultation with the public, we might as well go to Cork and have the consultation - no offence to Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">What we must first do is seek the tenders, find a place to locate the centres and base this on the evidence. The HSE and the committee set up through the HSE are mapping the entire centre of Dublin and the location of the facilities, where people are injecting, where they are unfortunately dying on the street and in their homes and the paraphernalia left around. All of this is centred around the inner city and the cohort in the capital city, particularly around what I would say are areas people come into because they are homeless, because of begging, because of their addiction and because of other reasons. Therefore, there is no point in putting the service out in Dún Laoghaire or anywhere similar because that is not where people are going. There is no point in providing a bus that would pull up on the side of the street and deal with people queuing and then move to another side of the street because that is not the way it should be done. These people need privacy. They need a little dignity when they go into these centres. Above all, they need to know that when they go into the centre, there are enough capable doctors and nurses and there is a wraparound service. That is what the injecting facility should be all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The Senators asked many questions, half of which I probably will not get through. Senator Ó Ríordáin said that no one has died in any of these injecting centres, and I reiterate that fact. Naloxone is now being distributed by families and so on, and it will be used in the services. There is every chance that people who overdose will not be found wanting because they will be in a service that will be able to react immediately to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> I take Senator Ó Ríordáin up on one thing he said about the media and about shame surrounding addiction. He is absolutely right. The media in this country love bad news, and the bad news is often a picture of someone dead down a laneway or lying in a skip from an overdose. They love such pictures because, unfortunately, they sell newspapers. However, this is not what the Bill is about. It is about caring for people who are chronic users and who are very ill. It is a health issue, and the reality of this will be seen in the next few months. We owe these people that opportunity to be able to go into a clean and safe environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Senator Ruane spoke about decriminalisation, and I know she is focusing on that in a Private Members' Bill. I am glad to have the opportunity to be able to sit down and talk to her about that into the future, and sooner rather than later. One point Senator Buttimer raised concerned the work the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, has done examining the Portuguese model. The justice committee established how it would go forward with a health-led rather than an offence-led approach for people who have been involved in criminality in respect of illegal drugs. That work must continue. As part of the national drugs strategy, it is our intention to review the report of the steering committee of the strategy and put into it an alternative approach to responding to those who have a history of offending. I have no problem sitting down with Senator Ruane and probably people from the Department as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_319"> I wish to refer back to something Senator Devine said about living in an area which down through the years has had its fair share of addiction problems, particularly in respect of young people and the families left behind. Any public representative, whether in Cork, Dublin, Limerick or elsewhere around the country, could relate to what she said about meeting young people particularly, and families that have been scourged by addiction. I refer to families and children who for whatever reason have been involved in very serious drug-related activity. Young children playing in parks and on streets raise health issues when, for example, they come across discarded needles, and this can have an effect on families. There was one such case last year in my constituency. A young lad playing ended up with a prick on his finger from a discarded needle. I understand the anxiety of parents in terms of what would happen if things did not turn out the way they did, but they turned out well enough in the end.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">Many questions were asked, and I will have to decipher some of my handwriting.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I thank the Senators who took part in the debate on the Bill. Before I reply to a number of the points that have been raised, I reiterate that the Bill is about reaching out to those people who are chronic drug users and who may also face other problems such as mental health issues and homelessness. Every person who uses drugs is a human being with a family and a community. Unfortunately, drug use can affect schoolchildren, students, mothers and fathers. What they have in common is drug use which has a problematic effect on their lives and which may impact on their relationships with their families and friends and the wider community and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The problem of street injecting is not always apparent, especially when it occurs in areas that are already socially deprived or neglected. It is even less apparent when it affects those in society who are marginalised, such as homeless people. No one chooses to inject drugs on the street. This is what the most desperate in our community and our society are driven to. We must reach out to help them, and this is what this Bill and the injecting centre aim to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The Bill does not provide for an exact location of the injecting centre in line with the experience of other countries. The location of the centre should be considered where the need of drug users is greatest. The views of local stakeholders should also be considered. As I said last week in the Dáil, the supervised injecting centre will be located where need is greatest. This is why I have asked the HSE to set up a working group. The group is engaged in a process of identifying where the effects of public injecting are most prevalent. The group will address the particular issues of setting up a pilot service, including consultation locally and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> In that regard, as a Minister of State, a public representative and a citizen of this country, wherever this centre is located, I want the residents and the community around it to be fully aware of what it will do before it opens. If we do not inform them, if we do not have consultation, it will only highlight other matters that need not be highlighted. I think there will be a real buy-in. I spoke about injecting centres last week at a meeting in the Liberties at which the issue was raised. I was very surprised by the reaction from people in general when they got the full gist of what the centre was about.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> It is the intention on passing the Bill to open an injecting centre on a pilot basis in Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Cork wants one as well. I will just throw that in for what it is worth. The pilot will be subject to an ongoing monitoring review with input from An Garda Síochána, the HSE and others. This pilot centre will be subject to a thorough evaluation in order to assess it in the Irish context, and how it meets the needs of people who inject drugs and indeed the wider community. The results of this pilot will inform decisions about any further injecting centres, including whether the pilot centre should continue to stay open. These decisions will be evidence-based. </p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The Bill clearly sets out that the licence issued will be for a defined period of time. The Minister is not obliged to grant a licence under the Bill and similarly the Minister is not obliged to renew a licence. Under section 5, the Minister is empowered to suspend or revoke a licence. This can occur when the Minister is satisfied that the licenceholder is no longer eligible to hold the licence or is in breach of the conditions of the licence or any relevant regulations made under the Act. The Minister will consult with the HSE, An Garda Síochána and others who may bring issues to the attention of the Minister in that respect. While I expect the pilot centre to be successful, if for some reason it is not, the Minister is not obliged to renew the licence or grant a further licence. If the evidence does not support the pilot service continuing, or if ongoing monitoring suggests that the centre is not operating as it should, the Bill enables the Minister to revoke the licence. </p>
          <p eId="para_330"> This Bill has been very carefully drafted to address the health-related harm associated with public injecting while ensuring that the misuse of drugs legislation remains undiluted in any way. Possession of controlled drugs will continue to be an offence outside an injecting centre. Possession for sale or supply will remain an offence both inside and outside the centre. </p>
          <p eId="para_331"> I will close with a statement I made in the Dáil last week about a poem. I will not go through the poem. I have taken three lines out of it which I believe are key to what supervised injecting centres should be about. It is a beautiful verse, but I would just like to recite three lines:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">Restoring hope</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_333">Opening doors </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_334">To life anew</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> That is what we are able to do with injecting centres. This Bill and this supervised injecting centre will open doors and restore hope. I thank the Chair and all the Senators for their contributions and for their knowledge around this issue. Anybody who has been in the Seanad this afternoon has already made a huge impact with this Bill, not only as individuals but in communities as well. I thank the Chair again and I thank the officials from the Department for their services over the last couple of weeks, particularly in putting the Bill together and helping me bring it through the different Stages. We are not finished yet but we are getting there.</p>

        <speech by="#ColetteKelleher" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_338">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> I am delighted to introduce the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017. I welcome visitors from the National Safeguarding Committee, the Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, SAGE, and my sisters from the south in the Public Gallery who are here for this occasion. In many ways this Bill is greenfield site legislation that I hope will become an important piece of the architecture of our legislation on rights, care and protections of people. The Bill's goal is to provide safeguards from abuse or harm, in particular for those who may be unable to protect themselves. It can be thought of as Children’s First legislation for adults at risk. It is important to note that this legislation is for all adults because at some point or other in all of our lives we may be at risk of abuse or harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> It is unfortunately true that many adults across the State are abused and harmed every day. This harm and abuse comes in many forms and from many quarters. Some of those who are abused and harmed have no voice of their own and no one to voice their concerns. Some are physically unable to reach out for help while others lack the capacity to do so. It is very likely that at some point in all of our lives we may be at risk of harm or abuse. It may not happen today or tomorrow but some day we may be the adult with dementia who is financially manipulated, or the person post stroke who can no longer speak, or a person with an intellectual disability who is taken advantage of, or the person whose adult son or daughter has turned their loving home into a personal prison. In yesterday's news reports we saw the horrific Armagh so-called house of horrors case where a vulnerable woman was abused for years on end. This legislation seeks to provide protection for people in these and many other situations. The 500,000 people aged 65 or over, people living in their own home, people living in institutions, people in nursing homes, people with mental ill health, people with autism and people with disabilities, both mental and physical, are particularly at risk of abuse and require robust safeguarding.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> While we do not have comprehensive statistics on abuse and neglect, the data that exist paint a very bleak picture. The National Study of Elder Abuse and Neglect from 2010 estimated that 10,000 older people are mistreated or neglected each year, with 6,000 cases of financial abuse. That study also showed that for many people who are financially abused, their only income was their State pension. Given that the State rightly pays more than €7 billion in pension payments and more than €3 billion in illness, disability and carers' payments, the scale of financial abuse is potentially massive. Dr. Amanda Phelan of UCD estimates that 32,000 older people were abused in the past 12 months - a staggering figure. We know form international studies that people with dementia are especially prone to abuse in the community, with rates as high as 55%.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> The need for a legislative provision to safeguard adults from harm and abuse has been highlighted several times by various bodies over the past six years beginning with a Law Reform Commission report in 2011. In 2014, RTE's "Prime Time Investigates" programme exposed high levels of abuse of adults at risk in Áras Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo. This investigation heightened awareness of abuse of adults nationally and the need for comprehensive action and reform. Following the RTE investigation, the HSE published its safeguarding policy, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse National Policy &amp; Procedures. This safeguarding policy outlines a number of principles to promote the independence and rights of adults who are vulnerable and outlines the procedures to be followed if there are concerns of abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult. The policy provides for a number of structures to be set up to support the safeguarding agenda. This includes the National Safeguarding Committee, on which I once served.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">In July 2016, the Health Service Executive, HSE, published the independent review of the Áras Attracta case. This review called for the HSE safeguarding policy to be put on a statutory footing. It noted:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_344">The HSE's safeguarding procedures are now being put in place and activated throughout Ireland. In order for these procedures to have teeth, however, they are required to be placed on a statutory basis. This would ensure that they are fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> Similarly, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in its submission last year to the Oireachtas Select Committee on the Future of Healthcare noted:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_346">We believe that now is the time to introduce safeguarding legislation to protect at risk adults from abuse and neglect. While national safeguarding protocols are in place following recent high-profile revelations of abuse, these do not go far enough to ensure the safety and rights of vulnerable people.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Last year the National Safeguarding Committee, chaired by Patricia Rickard-Clarke, formerly of the Law Reform Commission, published its strategic plan 2017-2021 which sets out a commitment to "initiate conversations with Government and Oireachtas Committees on the development of legislation to include adult safeguarding". In launching the report, Ms Justice Laffoy said there is a "significant gap in adult safeguarding". She also noted the need to "enshrine in law the rights of vulnerable people".</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> Safeguarding legislation has been also called for by a range of other stakeholders including non-governmental organisations, NGOs, academics, Oireachtas Members, including Deputy Mary Butler, front-line workers, concerned family members, people in the community and self-advocates. It is clear that the <i>status quo</i> is not working. The HSE policy does not go far enough. Staff working in this area have said they need powers to go with the responsibilities of the role and legislative backup to protect adults. There are also clear conflicts of interest. The HSE has too many roles, some of which are conflicting. It acts as the commissioner, funder and provider of services as well as police and protector. People with concerns often have nowhere else to go, no clear pathway, often resorting to the Committee of Public Accounts as whistleblowers as a last resort. That is why I have included an independent arm's length body in this Bill. In my consultations on the Bill I was alerted to many different cases of abuse. I was told about one older woman who was admitted to hospital for an extended period and could no longer pay her bills as normal at the post office. Instead she gave her bank details to a family member to pay her bills. When she examined her account after she left hospital, she found that someone had set up a range of direct debits to pay their own bills from her account. I was told about an elderly woman living with her son who had alcohol and addiction problems who was sometimes abusive but whom she loves, experiencing serious difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> The Grace case, which we have dealt with in detail in recent weeks, highlights more than others why we need legislation like this. The case, which involved an adult with intellectual disabilities, highlighted systemic and systematic failures to act to prevent abuse, conflicts of interest, poor separation of duties and responsibilities, and a lack of clarity about what to do. With Grace, her life and her welfare fell through all the cracks in our current system. The proposed legislation is a framework to protect people like Grace with clear definitions of abuse and obligations on those who could and would have acted. It creates an arm's length, independent body to prevent and investigate cases of abuse and harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> The goal of this Bill is to ensure cases like Grace, Áras Attracta or many others never happen again by changing culture and mindsets, with people recognising what abuse, harm and neglect are and having zero tolerance of them. It should act as a deterrent and put people off committing abusive acts, with sanctions for those who fail to act. It sets out clear pathways for action so that no one can say they did not know or did not know what to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> To that end the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017 does two main things. Part 3 provides for mandatory reporting by certain professionals and others where an adult has suffered abuse or harm, is suffering abuse or harm, or is at risk of suffering abuse or harm. Part 2 establishes a national adult safeguarding authority that will be required to respond effectively if significant concerns of abuse or harm are reported. The authority will have the power to investigate, including the power to enter. It will also have powers to direct the HSE and others to provide additional support or assistance if required. This was much emphasised by those working on the front line. It will also be able to appoint an independent advocate, a key protection especially endorsed by the self-advocates I met in preparing this Bill. It will also provide education, training and public awareness about what risk looks like and about adults at risk. It will promote standards in the safety and quality of services, provide guidance to State bodies and the Minister and provide information directly to adults at risk of abuse and harm via a helpline and website. This ability to self-refer is an important aspect of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> The Bill has a human rights focus and defines abuse and harm widely. These definitions are set out in Part 1. "Harm" includes assault and sexual and financial abuse. "Abuse" includes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_353">act, failure to act or neglect, which results in a breach of a person’s constitutional or legal rights, physical and mental health, dignity or general wellbeing, and may include ill-treatment, intimidation, humiliation, overmedication, withholding necessary medication, censoring communications, invasion or denial of privacy, or denial of access to visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Passing this legislation will ensure we make good on our commitment to Article 16 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_355">States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities, both within and outside the home, from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse, including their gender-based aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> The proposed legislation is informed by the following principles: the promotion of individual physical, mental and emotional well-being; the right to assistance, support and an independent advocate; the right to protection from abuse and neglect; interventions in people's lives must be necessary and proportionate; and respect for people's autonomy in decisions and interventions that affect them. The Bill, I hope, strikes a balance between the right to autonomy and the right to protection from harm. I have been working on this Bill for nine months. In that time I have been advised and assisted by staff within the House and by more than 40 stakeholders from a wide range of backgrounds, including NGOs, academics, front-line workers, families and people who will receive additional protections if this legislation passes.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> In particular I thank Patricia Rickard-Clarke, chairperson of the National Safeguarding Committee, for all her advice and guidance, and the self-advocates and individuals who for one reason or another would gain protections from this Bill and who informed the content and helped shape it. I also thank Dr. Sophia Carey from the Library and Research Service, Melissa English and David Hegarty from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, the barrister we worked with, David Dodd, and of course Padraig Rice for his invaluable support with this Bill and other work. I also thank my colleagues in the Seanad for the political support I have received for the Bill, in particular, Senators Buttimer, Clifford-Lee, Higgins, Bacik, O'Donnell, Boyhan, Black, Dolan and Ruane who all signed the Bill, and others who expressed their support, including Senator Conway-Walsh. It is rare to see such levels of cross-party support and I sincerely thank everyone for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Finally, I thank the Minister for Health and his officials who have been very generous with their time and advice. I am encouraged by the Minister's support and commitment to progress the Bill. It is urgent legislation but I understand it is complex, involves several Departments and requires some more development to become a long-term piece of our rights and care architecture. I am grateful, therefore, for the Minister's suggestion that we take this Bill forward to a form of pre-legislative scrutiny and I ask for a commitment today that a version of adult safeguarding legislation will be enacted within a year. I ask fellow Senators to pass this Bill tonight to ensure we can progress it to the next required stage.</p>

          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">I formally second the Bill. More than 100 years ago we gave asylum, in the best sense of the word, to people to protect them - people with mental health issues in the mental hospitals, people with other issues, the deaf and the dumb, as people were referred to, those who were blind, and those who were regarded as imbeciles. The cost of that protection was to be apart and sundered from the society they came from, to be forever outside. They were in a micro-community in those hospitals and other places. Just as in so many other areas such as communication, transport and medicine, there have been phenomenal changes over the past 100 or indeed 50 years. We put safeguards in place, develop mandatory standards, legislation and regulations, and we police them. Maybe we do not do that as well as we should but we have methods for doing that. There is data protection for people. Transport and vehicle standards and road and infrastructure standards have improved. In the medical area blood tests were not routine 30 or 40 years ago but they are now. We almost ask for the ones we want. In respect of blood transfusions approximately 30 years ago a Government precipitated a general election as a consequence of contaminated blood being provided by the State to people. We know the number of deaths that caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Now, more and more, people who have or who will have vulnerabilities live in the community. Those of us in the State are actively working to ensure people can move to or stay living in the community. We need a range of instruments to support them effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> I commend Senator Kelleher on bringing this Bill forward and I am honoured that she has asked me to second it. I want to make two pertinent points about Senator Kelleher. She has worked with the Cork Simon Community. She worked in the Cope Foundation for several years. She has worked in the Alzheimer Society of Ireland. Need we say more about someone who has felt, smelt and seen vulnerability in people, in our brothers and sisters? The other point I want to make relates to her general approach. She knows intimately the need for such legislation. She has clearly said this Bill is open to being improved and that she is open to it being improved. Having listened to and been close to people in vulnerable situations over many years, she has constructed this Bill and now she lays it before us all for further input into it and with the intention of approving it. I am asking every Member to engage with this reasonable, important and necessary legislative development to improve and pass it with the full support of the House. I can add my experience from across the gamut of disability and mental health issues for many years. I can say easily and in a relaxed way that this legislation is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> As a developed society, for the past quarter of a century, in particular, we have been forced to examine our own lapses in the provision of services and supports. I will not set out the litany, but we still have these lapses with us. We have seen our systems built too strongly on the twin pillars of trust and lack of ambition for people's lives. Consequently, we must know truly in our hearts that we need a body of safeguards. This Bill is an important element in this regard. It will also have a powerful and vital element in changing mindsets about people. That is crucial. Sometimes the measures will have to drag people to change their mindset, but I hope that will not always be the case. There is a good balance of carrot and stick in the Bill. Every person is vulnerable and everyone merits the dignity that the protection in the Bill would bring.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Another point is important. There is no group or class of people who are vulnerable adults or who are vulnerable by virtue of any category. Sadly, some people come into this world in a vulnerable situation and remain vulnerable for their lives, whatever the length. This Bill is about the universal condition of vulnerability. We have lessened vulnerability for some people in some components of their lives because of the actions we have taken, for example, the marriage equality legislation. Many instruments are needed, including this legislation. At some point in our lives, as individuals, we are all vulnerable. Let us consider the years of recession when we saw loss of jobs, homes and families. Other examples include marital break-up and life-changing illness or disability. When my nearest and dearest are vulnerable, I am vulnerable. Vulnerability can arise through neglect, mistreatment or the infliction of harm. It can come from being seen as a lesser person or a less valuable human being and can derive through age or other changed circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Some of us manage to muddle through with the support of empowering friends and contacts or with the love of other people who are close to us as well as the love of some people who we had thought were not close to us. Sadly, these natural supports are not always available to us. We are not always allied with supporters and advocates who can put manners on the relevant person or entities. That is why we need this legislation. This Bill is one of the necessary modern methods to be able to provide protection. It is needed so that people can live freely in the community. The ultimate prize is to have people being protected and safeguarded as and when necessary in order that they can have good lives in the community and so that they can thrive and flourish.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_365">I thank Senator Kelleher for bringing forward this Bill today. The Government supports the principle of providing a legislative basis for the safeguarding of vulnerable adults. At a personal level, I welcome Senator Kelleher's efforts to progress legislation in this area. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, was scheduled to take this debate on behalf of the Government, but I wanted to be here for the start of the debate to show my personal commitment to working with Senator Kelleher and all Senators on all sides of the House to try to make progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The issues covered in Senator Kelleher's Bill are complex and broad, as the Senator has acknowledged. They extend far beyond the scope of the health sector alone or of any one Department. Strong collaboration and joined-up thinking will be required from a number of Departments and State agencies to ensure we provide the best legislative solution to safeguarding vulnerable adults across all services provided by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Senator Kelleher knows these areas well and I am keen to extend my thanks to her. It is a particular pleasure to do so in front of her family, who have travelled to be with her this evening. I extend my thanks to Senator Kelleher not only for this substantial work, this Private Members' Bill, but also for the work she has put in over many years with vulnerable people, including her work with the Simon Community, the Cope Foundation and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland as well as on children's issues in the UK. I greatly value her expertise and input and I look forward to working with her on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount. A framework of policies and procedures is in place in Ireland for the safeguarding of vulnerable people at risk of abuse. I will outline some of these measures shortly, but it must be noted - this is important and represents a collective failing on the part of all of us - that there is no statutory framework underpinning these policies. I agree strongly that a legislative basis must be provided for this safeguarding.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> The development of appropriate legislation is under consideration. This is a broad tranche of work that will involve an extensive scoping exercise across a number of different sectors to determine the precise nature of legislation involved. To this end, I sought the assistance of the Attorney General in liaising with the Law Reform Commission to conduct research in the area, as per the Law Reform Commission Act 1975. Consultation will also be required between relevant Departments. The most relevant Departments include the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Social Protection, my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as others. We need to identify the current legislative gaps in the protection of vulnerable adults. Public consultation with stakeholders will be necessary as well to allow affected parties to express their views. It is important we hear their views and voice regarding improvements to the current system. By identifying the major legislative gaps and the preferred approach to addressing these issues in the context of the considerations of the Law Reform Commission on these matters, the Government will be in a position to determine the Departments most equipped to lead on the development of legislative solutions and the agency or agencies to be tasked with implementation. We know that implementation in this country is key. All of these processes will need to feed into the refinement of the Bill to promote adequately and effectively the safeguarding of adults at risk. That is the point we all want to get to as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Before looking at some of the specific measures in the Bill, I will outline current policy and how it is being implemented. This is an important context to any debate on the matter. The Health Service Executive published its national safeguarding policy and procedures document, Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, in December 2014. The origins of this policy lie in the report, Protecting Our Future: Report of the Working Group on Elder Abuse, which was published in September 2002. Following the publication of that report, an elder abuse service was established by the HSE. In 2014, the last year for which figures were published, a total of 2,595 referrals were made to the service. This was an increase of 5% on referrals made in the previous year. Psychological abuse was the most frequently reported form of elder abuse at 28% of all complaints. This was followed by financial abuse, which accounted for 21%. The figure for self-neglect was 21% and the figure for physical abuse was 12%. A total of 66% of referrals in 2014 related to women. Of these, the majority were in the over 80 age category. That category accounted for 54% of cases. The referral rate was nearly four times greater in the over 80s when compared with the 65 to 79 years of age category. Public health nursing was the main referral source, amounting to 29% of referrals. This was followed by hospitals, which accounted for 14% of referrals, and family in the case of 13% of referrals.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">There was a significant increase in the number of concerns that first originated from older people, from 19% in 2013 to 26% in 2014. This increase shows that more older people were referring and reporting abuse directly to the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> The HSE has established a number of structures to implement its national safeguarding policy, including a national safeguarding office and a national safeguarding committee. Safeguarding and protection teams to deal with suspected abuse have also been established in each of the nine community health care organisation areas. These teams are managed and led by a principal social worker and staffed by social work team leaders and social workers. Staff training is ongoing, with a target to train a minimum of 17,000 staff in safeguarding during 2017. Over 900 existing care staff have been assigned as designated officers in service settings within the HSE's social care division to receive concerns or referrals of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The national safeguarding committee was formally established in December 2015 and includes multi-agency and inter-sectoral representation. The committee is independently chaired by Ms Patricia T. Rickard-Clarke. I welcome Ms Rickard-Clarke and her colleagues to the Seanad this evening and thank them for the huge body of work they have undertaken and note the important role it will have in inputting into any legislative solution. The committee has agreed terms of reference but its overarching remit is to support the development of a societal and organisational culture which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguards them from abuse. Its remit extends beyond abuse of older people, those with mental health conditions or people with disabilities. Importantly, as both Senators Kelleher and Dolan have alluded to, the committee recognises that any vulnerable adult can be subject to abuse and that vulnerability can be a transient or permanent state depending on many influences. Any of us can become vulnerable at a certain point in our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The national safeguarding committee published its strategic plan for the period 2017 to 2021 on 20 December 2016. One of the strategic objectives it identifies is the initiation of conversations with Government and the Oireachtas on the development of legislation on adult safeguarding. I welcome this. The work of the committee to date has confirmed that the scope of the issues relating to the safeguarding of vulnerable adults goes far beyond just the area of health and that a much broader, cross-sectoral approach is needed. Senator Kelleher served as a member of the committee on its formation. The involvement of the committee will be a key factor in the successful development of legislation. Perhaps the pre-legislative stage could provide an opportunity for further discussions and input from the national safeguarding committee directly to an Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Following Government approval in November 2015, I had the pleasure of launching the national patient safety office, NPSO, in December 2016. The aim of the office is to give policy direction and leadership in order to bring about improvements in patient safety to a health system that has been the subject of numerous investigative reports on patient safety incidents in recent years. The NPSO is developing a patient safety complaints and advocacy policy. This is in line with recent commitments to examining the complaints process as set out in the Health Act 2004 and associated regulation. The work has commenced with an examination of existing complaints models and systems internationally and a scoping exercise in respect of what exists in Ireland has been completed. The HSE’s Your Service, Your Say policy is currently being updated. In addition, patients can make complaints to the Ombudsman and to service and professional regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> The Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017, which we are debating this evening and which was published by Senator Kelleher, proposes the establishment of a national adult safeguarding authority with the objectives of promoting the safeguarding of adults at risk, and reducing the abuse and harm of adults at risk. The functions of the proposed authority would include: the undertaking of investigations where the authority believes on reasonable grounds that there is a risk of abuse or harm to an adult at risk; receiving reports from mandated persons under the legislation; promoting standards and providing information to adults at risk; and supervising compliance with duties imposed under the legislation. The Bill also includes measures to provide for: the provision of an independent advocate to an adult at risk who is the subject of an investigation; the appointment of authorised persons to conduct investigations and receive reports; and the imposition of a mandatory reporting obligation on a broad list of mandated persons. These issues will need to be thought through very carefully and I am glad the Senator has agreed that detailed pre-legislative scrutiny is the best forum in which we can iron out this detail and hear from all of the appropriate stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I will now deal with some of the issues in the Bill and I do so to be helpful. I hope they are seen in the constructive manner in which they are meant. This is intended to spark the debate about how we can best progress the legislative underpinning of this important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> A key element of the Bill is the establishment of a new authority to undertake investigations and receive reports from mandated persons. As a Government, we would prefer, as a general rule, to see new functions allocated to existing bodies, to avoid the large cost or, at times, extensive delays associated with the creation of an entirely new organisation. That is a matter that can be teased out further in the context of whether it is better to have a new authority or whether there is an existing authority that could fulfil that function, and the pros and cons of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> In respect of the health service alone, consultation will be needed with the HSE and regulators such as the Mental Health Commission and HIQA. The remit of the proposed authority would be much wider than the existing HSE safeguarding and protection teams, the remit of which extends only to HSE and HSE-funded providers of disability and older people’s services, including private nursing homes. We need to establish how we ensure that we capture a broader range of responsibilities than those relating to the existing safeguarding and protection teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The proposed authority would have the power and duty to investigate allegations in relation to any adult who may be vulnerable wherever they may reside and regardless of their connection with statutory services. The relationship between the proposed authority, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission would also need to be clarified and discussed in further detail. In addition, consultation would be required with a broad range of stakeholders across the range of affected sectors to determine the best model prior to any final decision being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The HSE has an extensive staffing system in place for the protection of vulnerable adults at risk of abuse. There are in the region of 60 staff employed in safeguarding teams in the community health care organisations, which are managed and led by a principal social worker and staffed by social work team leaders and social workers. Extensive staff training is in place, as I have outlined, and over 900 designated officers have been appointed in service settings within the HSE’s social care division to receive concerns or referrals of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> It would be important, at the pre-legislative stage, to ensure complete clarity between the roles of the proposed authority and those already <i>in situ </i>in the HSE, and to avoid overlap of functions, for example, in respect of training, publicity and the categories of authorised and mandated persons. In addition, under the functions of the proposed authority, there is a lack of statutory obligation for it to have regard to resources available to the HSE or any other public body with which it may have dealings. This is something that is included, for example, in section 8(2) of the Health Act 2007 whereby HIQA must have regard to the resources of the HSE in carrying out its functions. That matter would be worthy of discussion at committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Notwithstanding the issue of best practice, the proposals included in the Bill would need to be costed at a later stage. Any additional services would need to be costed in a detailed form and resourced properly, and details of this would need to be included in the Estimates and budgetary process that we need to go through in both Houses on an annual basis. Detailed scoping work would need to be carried out by all relevant Government Departments to cost these services so that we could have them in place when the time comes for Estimates and budgetary discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The Bill, as drafted, relies heavily for the provision of independent advocates on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. It is important to state that this Act is being commenced on a phased basis. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the decision support service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act come into force. A high-level steering group comprising senior officials from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the decision support service and this work is ongoing. It is not possible to provide an exact timeline for the full implementation of that Act. That, again, is an example of the discussion that we would need to have including the Department of Justice and Equality. Pre-legislative scrutiny might provide that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> A substantial number of new powers and responsibilities are proposed in the Bill, including the proposed investigation process, the right of entry and inspection by an authorised person, the mandatory reporting by mandated persons and the schedule of persons to be specified as mandated. All of these matters will require careful legal consideration before their appropriateness can be determined. In outlining the issues that need to be teased out, I want to make clear that I am not dismissing the provisions in the Bill or undermining them in any way. Rather, I am seeking to provide a roadmap in respect of the issues we need to discuss at the pre-legislative stage. We need to hear from the relevant stakeholders and regulators - HIQA, the Mental Health Commission, the HSE, other Government Departments that have a role to play - and, most importantly, from the people we are trying to protect on these issues. These are some of the matters that will require further discussion and that is why I welcome the opportunity to do that at pre-legislative scrutiny stage. I do not see that as an effort to stall in any way what we all want to achieve, namely, the underpinning of the safeguarding of vulnerable adults on a statutory basis. I remain absolutely committed to working with Senator Kelleher in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I sincerely welcome the platform provided by this debate to put on record the Government’s position on the safeguarding of vulnerable adults in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount. It is an area in which we have failed collectively time and again as a State. We clearly need to do something because what we have done to date has not been adequate, and we have seen many an example of that in recent weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> I agree that this protection should be and must be placed on a statutory basis in an appropriate way. My Department is committed to working with all other relevant Departments and stakeholders to put comprehensive and effective legislation in place. We need to have that broad consultation and we need to have the legal advice necessary to make sure we get this right in the interests of those whose needs we must prioritise.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I sincerely thank and congratulate Senator Kelleher on introducing this Bill. I look forward to working with her and colleagues in both Houses to ensure we progress the principle of what we are trying to advance to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the protections that they require.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I, too, commend Senator Kelleher on the effort she put into this Bill. It is fantastic. Fianna Fáil is happy to support and co-sponsor this Bill which aims to put additional protections in place to protect all adults from the possibility that at some stage in their lives they may be at risk of abuse or harm. I also welcome members of the Support and Advocacy Service for Older People, SAGE, and the National Safeguarding Committee as well as members of Senator Kelleher's family.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> This Bill's goal is to ensure cases like Grace, Áras Attracta, with which I would be very familiar in my area, and many others will never happen again. This Bill provides for mandatory reporting by certain professionals and others where an adult has suffered abuse or harm, is suffering abuse or harm or is at risk of suffering abuse or harm. It is important to identity what is meant by abuse and harm. Harm includes assault and sexual and financial abuse. Abuse includes acts, failure to act or neglect which results in a breach of a person's constitutional or legal rights, physical and mental health, dignity or general well-being and may include ill treatment, intimidation, humiliation, as we saw in the Áras Attracta programme, overmedication or undermedication, censoring communications, invasion or denial of privacy or denial of access to visitors. In 2014, the RTE "Prime Time Investigates" programme exposed the high levels of abuse of adults in the Áras Attracta setting in Swinford, County Mayo, with which I am very familiar. It heightened the awareness of abuse of adults nationally and solidified the need for comprehensive action and legislative reform. We were all shocked, and certainly I was, at the disgusting behaviour of health professionals on the night of that programme, and I was truly hurt and embarrassed as a health professional to witness what we did on that night. I hope we will never see the likes of it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The proposed legislation is informed by the following principles: the promotion of individual physical, mental and emotional well-being, and the right to assistance, support and an independent advocate. We might ask what is an independent advocate. It is important that a person speaks or writes in support or defence of a vulnerable person. That is what an advocate is. Other principles include the right to protection from abuse and neglect; interventions in people's lives must be necessary and appropriate; and there must be respect for people's autonomy in decisions and interventions affecting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> It is also worth acknowledging that a great deal has been done in recent years. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is now ten years old. The enactment of the Children First Act is another welcome development and improvement. Similarly, the passage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is a further manifestation of improving standards. It is to be hoped we will soon see the passage of a disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a another positive step. I commend Senator Dolan on all his work in this regard and the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his commitment to reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> With respect to the HSE's response to the Grace case, one of the most important and significant recommendations of the Conal Devine report was the provision and the implementation of a safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults. The HSE launched a national safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults in 2014, and while the safeguarding policy is currently not supported by legislation, it is a significant development in the protection of vulnerable adults, both those in residential services as well as those living at home. I would welcome that safeguarding being placed on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I am delighted to lend my support and that of my party to this Bill. I once again commend Senator Kelleher on her hard work on it. Her efforts were Herculean.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_396">I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank Senator Kelleher, in particular, for co-ordinating and drafting all the work that has gone into this Bill. It is being co-sponsored across parties. That is a measure of Senator Kelleher's broad support, the respect she holds in this House and her understanding of these very complex issues, and I acknowledge that. Previous speakers spoke about her past experience. From the very first day I met her here, she has been passionate about care. She has proven time and again that she has used her experience in this House very effectively in terms of legislation. This is a particular case in point, and it is important to note that.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> There are 24 sections in this important Bill. When Senator Kelleher first came to me and asked if I would co-sign it, which I immediately agreed to do, she said it might not be perfect but it is a start. It is an exceptionally good start. It may need slight tweaking, and that is where we all come in. We are all working together for the one objective, which is ultimately the safeguarding of adults. I like the Senator's emphasis on all adults. As she clearly pointed out, we will all be vulnerable at some stage in our lives. That is the nature of life. There will be times when we will be vulnerable, weak and reliant. We will be dependent on other people to advocate for us and to defend our rights. That is a human response and a human need. I would like to think everyone would want to vindicate and support that safeguarding and protection of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> The Minister and Senator Kelleher made the point, with which I agree, that this Bill has a strong human rights focus, and why would it not? This is about human rights and about respect for humanity and people. The Bill proposes the establishment of a national adult safeguarding authority with the objectives of promoting the safeguarding of adults at risk and reducing the abuse and harm of adults at risk, which will be some of the functions of that proposed authority. The proposals in the Bill are: to promote standards in the safety and quality of services provided for adults at risk, and that is what is envisaged in the national adult safeguarding authority; to undertake investigations where it believes, on reasonable grounds, there is a risk of abuse or harm of an adult at risk; to promote education, training and public awareness of the Act on matters concerning adults at risk; and to provide information to adults at risk in respect of abuse and harm they may be suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> We all know that abuse is very complex. It can be emotional, physical, financial, mental or sexual. There is a range of abuse, all of which is abuse, and there is no greater or lesser category of abuse. It is simply abuse. It is an appalling and shocking thing to happen to anyone and no one should have to suffer abuse. More important, however, people need to be empowered to respond and seek out help and support when they are the subject of abuse. That is important. It is also important to say that not all abuse happens in institutional care. We know people are abused in their family homes. We know family members abuse members of their family, be they young, middle-aged or old. That is the reality of it. We all know that from our casework. It is important that such work takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Schedule 1 to the Bill reads, "The following classes of persons are specified as mandated persons for the purpose of this Act". It occurred to me as I read the list of mandated persons, which includes medical practitioners, social workers, probation officers, teachers and members of An Garda Síochána, that, sadly, I have read or heard of cases of abuse in every one of those categories. It has impacted on all those professions. Abuse knows no bounds, as we all know. That is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> It is important the focus in the Bill is kept on the provision of person-centred support. It is important, with respect to the proposed national adult safeguarding authority, the establishment of which this Bill seeks to achieve, that it acts professionally and ethically, which is very important, and that we envisage and hope to empower people, either individually or collectively, which is very much needed, and that we protect and promote the rights of all adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">We must always act with a duty of care to people. People need to be empowered and understand the implications of that. We need to ensure the wishes and the preferences of individuals are taken into account when dealing with abuse. Far too often, I have met people who were in an abusive situation who do not feel they have any power and are afraid. Their first port of call may be to the authority that they are complaining about. That is the reality of it. There are real issues for people in identifying an appropriate first port of call, particularly in a care situation. This is particularly so if they are vulnerable or do not have family to assist in dealing with whatever organisation it may be. It is important that we inform people of the scope of abuses and empower them to go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> There are real issues in maintaining independence of service from service providers in terms of protecting people. This is a real issue, as is the area of maintaining confidentiality. We have seen many instances in the past few months of people who wanted and sought help and had elements of their confidentiality eroded or not respected. It is very important that we at all times deal with the person and his or her story. They need space, time, support and confidentiality. However, confidentiality cannot be used to close down investigations and open up issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> During my time in the Seanad, I have had to make representations on a number of cases of alleged abuse in institutions of this State. I have been bitterly disappointed by the lack of engagement. I have been bitterly disappointed that people who have alleged they are suffering abuse have not had the support of the agencies and authorities that should support them. I put that on the record of this House. I am pursuing one or two issues at a very senior level, which is the appropriate place. There will come a time when I will have to push out further. I do not think that is good enough. To go back to people who are suffering and tell them there is a process which takes a long time is no good for people in that terrible situation. We need competence, compassion, care, understanding and support for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I encourage everyone to support this Bill. The Minister has talked about pre-legislative scrutiny. The time is now. It is time for us to act, not delay this Bill. If there is to be pre-legislative scrutiny, which I understand and recognise is important, we do not want delay. We accept and acknowledge it needs to happen. We accept and acknowledge that people are being abused in institutions of this State. We know the record. </p>
          <p eId="para_406"> I pay particular tribute to RTE and the media - print, radio and television - because they have opened up the window and beamed terrible stories into our homes. It is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I want to hear when the next Stage of this proposed legislation which will give a statutory basis to protecting and safeguarding people will be. I thank the proposer and all those who co-signed the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_408">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank Senator Kelleher for bringing forward this Bill. It is quite comprehensive and a lot of work has gone into it. I pay tribute to the Senator and the people who helped her because it is a very carefully drafted document, not something that was drafted in a very short period of time. A lot of thought has gone into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> It is very important that we provide the level of safeguard and security proposed by the Bill, particularly as it is now very relevant. While we might initially think the Bill will concern people with disabilities, there has been a huge demographic change in this country and we have more and more older people who will benefit from it. The age profile in the country is going to change quite dramatically. We also have more and more people living on their own whose families have left the country, meaning the level of family support that was there in the past may not be there in years to come. That is something to keep in mind. This Bill is very important from that point of view. The Bill clearly sets up mechanisms for dealing with those situations and providing safeguards such as setting up the national adult safeguarding authority, the functions of which are set out in the Bill. The Bill is well thought-out in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> One of the Bills I have brought into this House was in regard to professional home carers. There is currently no regulation of those who are providing home care. That is an area that needs to be dealt with. There are 32 organisations providing home care services but they are not really covered by legislation. There is an understanding between the HSE and these organisations but there is no statutory regulation in place. That is something which this legislation covers also. It would be worth looking at Senator Kelleher's Bill along with the Bill I brought forward in regard to home care because there is not adequate legislation in place to deal with this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> There is an issue about legislation that is in place but not being implemented. An example of this is the role of disability officers in local authorities. I have spoken to a number of different local authorities, each of which has a different interpretation of the role of the disability officer. I raised this issue because I came across a family whose child had intellectual and physical disabilities. I have mentioned this before in this House. The family needed major changes to their house in order to look after their child. Six years later, nothing had been done by the local authority. When I contacted the disability officer, the response was that it is not the disability officer's job to advocate for that child. The disability officer saw the role as being to provide access to public buildings, not to advocate for people with disabilities. That interpretation is wrong. When I rang the National Disability Authority, it had a totally different interpretation. It is an issue that is quite easy to check out. The Minister of State could write to every local authority, setting out the role of the disability officer, and examine whether there is legislation in place which is not being implemented. I believe there is. I have asked the National Disability Authority to write to each local authority and update them on the role of the disability officer. When I rang one local authority, its disability officer had got two things done that year at a cost of €8,000. That was the only work the officer did during the year as disability officer because this person also had responsibilities for other areas in the local authority. That is a very simple issue to rectify. It is grand to bring in legislation and have it in place but then we must ensure it is used effectively. </p>
          <p eId="para_412"> This is very welcome legislation because it opens up the discussion about the responsibilities and duties of individuals and statutory and local authorities. We need to see if they are being used effectively. If one takes the case of the child with major intellectual and physical disability, I had to take that all the way to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children before I got the local authority to do the necessary work on the house for the family. It is important that legislation which is brought in is followed up on. </p>
          <p eId="para_413"> At section 12 of this Bill, the role of the independent advocate is clearly set out. That is extremely important because there are situations where an adult may be living with his or her parents but the parents are unable to adequately put forward their concerns. This could be someone with a disability. That is also extremely important. </p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I welcome this legislation. It opens up the entire discussion. I agree with other Senators that it is important that the legislation is not parked for another three or four years before being dealt with. We must bring forward comprehensive legislation to deal with all of this area and also the issue of home care and home care providers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_415">I welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome visitors and stakeholders, particularly Senator Kelleher's sister. I am sure they all worked with Senator Kelleher for nine months - a gestation period - hoping to get this Bill through, so well done to them. This Bill is about five things - awareness, understanding, procedure, good practice and mandatory reporting. The Bill will bring awareness and urgency regarding all adults in vulnerable situations. Vulnerability is fluid. We can all be vulnerable at different stages of our lives. It is not just for those who may have additional needs, although it will primarily offer them the protection they deserve. It is for the protection of anyone who may find themselves vulnerable to abuse. It is to be welcomed that this House and society are addressing this and putting it on the record that there are vulnerable adults. It could be any one of us and it is an issue that is serious and deserves legislative support.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Recalling my own experiences in nursing in the community here and in Belfast, I have come across a lot of at-risk or neglected individuals. I had a duty of care and I could report abuse because I could go to my own regulatory body to do so. However, I have met ordinary care workers who still ring me to seek advice. They are very concerned, particularly when dealing with an older person or a person with a disability in the home setting. They are terrified and do not know where to go. It is to be hoped this Bill will give them the lead and responsibility they need. It will bring an understanding to those in the community and care sectors, who are currently at a loss as to how to manage situations involving adults and abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Many people in the community and care sectors are in no man's land if they are suspicious or if there are allegations or actual cases of abuse towards adults. There is no clear understanding about where to turn to, what the worker is responsible for and the most appropriate way to respond. This Bill clears up a lot of this confusion. Given Senator Kelleher's background in community work, for this legislation to come from the ground and the Senator's own experience and go through this House first is great news and is to be welcomed. We as legislators must listen to those who have first-hand experience. Perhaps if those in power had listened sooner, we would have had this legislation earlier and avoided many of the recent controversies in the news. My colleagues continually tried to report abuse in Áras Attracta 15 years ago. They were not listened to and, as Senator Swanick said, it was our other colleagues who were perpetrating this abuse. It took an RTE programme to blow it out of the water, so to speak, and get it into the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I welcome this Bill which will introduce clear procedures and outline key responsibilities for agencies in dealing with vulnerable adults. Having awareness, understanding and a protocol results in good practice. I commend Senator Kelleher on moving beyond the indignation felt by all of us about the recent stories of Grace, Mary et al and formulating this Bill, which puts key measures in place to ensure these types of atrocities are not seen again. This is why Sinn Féin is happy to co-sign this Bill. We believe it will bring positive change to this Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> One element of the Bill is vitally important, namely, the provision set out in section 12 which outlines the need for an independent advocate to assist and support should they be requested. The reality is that independent advocacy would aid many different elements in our society, for example, in respect of the mental health tribunals about which I am conducting research. This morning's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs involved a discussion about advocacy for children in need. The rationale for the provision of advocacy is clear. It ensures fairness, dignity and support for the vulnerable person regardless of ability or situation. It is vitally important. We look at the great work of the Irish Advocacy Network.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> I note that we have a few small changes to make around definitions in the Bill. It is nothing major. The changes would add to already solid legislation. I am sure people will agree that the stronger we make this Bill with regard to definitions and remit, the better. Sinn Féin hopes Senator Kelleher will welcome the small changes in an enabling capacity on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> In light of all the recent dark controversies regarding adults who were abused and left unprotected, I am at least partially comforted by the idea that cases will never be allowed to happen again. This legislation will play an important role in this regard. Over recent months, based on my experience in the Seanad and committees, I believe we are entering an age of modernisation or enlightenment. So many Bills and motions are going through that seek to protect the vulnerable. We are beginning to recognise the need to mind each other and to care for and embrace those who do not have a strong voice at different stages of their lives. I have no doubt that support will be given throughout this House and I again commend Senator Kelleher.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesBlack" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_422">I commend Senator Kelleher on introducing this Bill and all those who have supported it. I wholeheartedly welcome this legislation because we all know that some of the most heinous crimes committed in this country target the vulnerable. I believe this legislation tackles the abuse of vulnerable adults and will lead to equality of treatment of all people.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Abuse of the vulnerable can take many forms. It can be sexual as in the Grace and Mary cases. It can be neglect. It can be physical and psychological abuse in the case of the Áras Attracta scandal. A society should be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable, and all safeguards must be implemented to ensure the proper treatment of vulnerable adults. Some vulnerable adults may not even be aware of their abuse. I believe that special education programmes could be made available to vulnerable adults so that they understand when they are being abused and have the language and opportunity to report this. The exploitation of the elderly by unscrupulous people in getting them to withdraw cash to pay for unnecessary property repairs and renovations is another example of vulnerable adults being abused. Bank employees could be educated to recognise this type of exploitation and to ensure any large cash withdrawals for this type of work are replaced by bank drafts payable to the contractor. With all the questions that have recently come to light about the integrity of the Garda Síochána and its inaccurate reporting of issues, I think it is necessary to examine the practice of Garda questioning of vulnerable adults. The appointment of an independent advocate should address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I see the need for this legislation on a weekly basis through my work with the RISE Foundation. We offer support for family members impacted by the alcohol and drug misuse of a loved one. Family members who have a loved one in addiction often struggle with shame, stress and anxiety. They are terrified to ask for help because of the risk of being judged by society, especially when they are living under the threat of violence from drug gangs because of drug debts accumulated by their loved ones. Recently, I worked with two elderly women whose sons were in addiction, both living in rural communities. One of them who lives in an isolated area on her own had extremely threatening drug dealers call to her house. She was terrified. Another incident involved one woman having a photograph of her six year old grandchild sent to her with a note asking for huge amounts of money that she did not have. She ended up going to the credit union but still lives in fear. I believe these vulnerable women will benefit from the support available through this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Vulnerability can occur at many times in an adult's life and can be as a result of health, financial or other difficulties. When people are in this state, they are often easy targets for exploitation. People with health difficulties can be forced by family members or others to sign over property or assets against their will. This Bill will protect these vulnerable people. People who find themselves in financial difficulties can often be preyed upon by people who can exploit their weaknesses and get them to sign up to high interest loans. These people need to know their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Some elderly people have to end their days in nursing homes when their families are unable to give them the care they require. This is a very difficult decision for any family. This Bill will safeguard the rights of these vulnerable adults to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve and will also give peace of mind to the family who can have confidence that the homes are properly monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Another group of people in society who are vulnerable is that comprising adults with intellectual disabilities. The recent case of a young woman being left in foster care despite allegations of sexual abuse highlights the gaps in services in our country and I am of the view that the introduction of this legislation will go a long way to address these.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I welcome the legislation. I commend Senator Kelleher and all involved for the great work they have done.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_429">I, too, welcome this Bill. I commend Senator Kelleher and all her colleagues in this House and those outside it who have helped her with this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Sometimes, when we see a proposal to establish a new statutory body, we can query whether it might be easy to propose and difficult to oppose. In respect of this issue however, I think we now have sufficient experience to judge that adults who are at risk really do not have the protective system that we accord to children by means of the Ombudsman for Children or similar bodies. The adults in question really are an isolated group of people. They depend on agencies such as HIQA and so on to pick up indications of their potential abuse. There is a very strong case for, first, enshrining in law an obligation on mandated people to do something about any information in their possession relating to an adult at risk in order to safeguard them from harm and, second, setting up a mechanism for something to be done about any information that they impart on foot of their mandated duty, and for steps to be taken to protect adults at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> We all know, increasingly now, of cases of adults - not merely in care institutions, but sometimes in the care of their families - who are abused and subjected to humiliating treatment and a lifetime of misery. Part of the background in which those kind of things can occur is the absence of a national policy and a national mechanism for dealing with such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I do not want to add to the troubles of An Garda Síochána, but I was struck by the recent figures, which were mentioned in last weekend's edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, relating to the differential in domestic abuse reportage in this part of Ireland compared to Northern Ireland. I fully understand why that may have been the case. It may have been a legacy of a previous time, when what went on within a home belonged within that home, the family was to be respected as an institution and gardaí were disinclined to become involved, even in cases of domestic violence. Whatever the reason, this differential is wholly unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> The disinclination to become involved and the inclination to avoid becoming involved in messy situations where it would be difficult, for example, to sustain the necessary ingredients to a criminal investigation, form part of a background in which we find that people are left vulnerable and without any real help. I just mentioned the psychology that would lead gardaí to stand away from domestic violence. Even if one tries to understand that psychology, which I do not think we should try to do anymore, it probably indicates a national characteristic to avert our eyes and not become involved, not be seen as busybodies, not make reports and not risk offending people or creating misunderstanding. This leaves vulnerable people with no real assistance or hope of an end to their suffering at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Having said that, I really do believe that this legislation is a very valuable starting point. I am delighted that it has such cross-party support. I know that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will probably have a fit when it sees the Bill because it will ask who is going to fund all this. Words are cheap. Apologies are cheap. Commissions of investigation are not cheap but they are a great way of doing nothing while other people give one time to work out where one stands on issues. This Bill puts it up to us, as parliamentarians, to consider whether we will do something for adults at risk. It is a worthwhile Bill. It should pass Second Stage and be accepted by the Government. I await the Minister of State's response to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LynnRuane" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Senator Lynn Ruane<recordedTime time="2017-04-05T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_435">I had not planned on speaking but as I was listening to everyone's contributions, I could not help thinking back over so many of the faces and the cases of adult abuse I have witnessed over the years. Although we have uncovered some of the most extreme cases, there are many cases that are so subtle and so carefully manipulated that we will never be able to pinpoint that they are happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> I remember one woman who was living in a homeless service and who had managed to get away from her family. Her sons and her husband had been constantly sexually abusing and raping her. When she found refuge in a city centre hostel, that family continued, every week, to find her at her local post office, to further beat her up and to take her weekly money so that she would be left begging on the streets. That was obviously an awful situation, but I learned as I worked longer in the homeless service that it was not an isolated case of family members finding a vulnerable adult wherever they had found refuge and continuing the abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> There was another woman who lived in her home in the Dublin 12 community. Her son came every week and did the same. He would take her money and leave. She would be left begging outside the shops within her own community because she did not have access to her own social welfare money. The issue of financial abuse of older people is huge. How do we unearth that it is happening within families? How do we even get there? It is quite scary to think that we might never be able to fully protect vulnerable people.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Another case comes to mind. My father died four years ago this week. He obviously had quite a young family. He was quite old when I was born, so he was in the fortunate position of having a young daughter who did not really listen to the advice of the medical profession and kept insisting on more. I unearthed so many different illnesses that he had and that the medical professionals tried to say he did not have. I had no medical background but I fought for years to get a proper diagnosis for my father. I refused to believe their diagnoses and it turned out in the end that I was right. There was one thing that stood out to me throughout my father's illness. He had dementia. I remember going to the hospital one day - I will not name the hospital because I have an ongoing back-and-forth with it - and my father sang. He found refuge in song. Every time he felt uncomfortable or scared of a situation because of hallucinations caused by his Lewy body disease, he would sing. The one thing he could remember, and which took him back to that moment of safety, were the words of a song. We sang every day until the day he died and I taught him songs, even right up to those of Paolo Nutini. He was still learning until the day he died.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I remember going up to the hospital one day. I experienced a lot of things that no older person should have to endure. I witnessed him being left in his own urine, being left without his catheter and having to fight for things. Medical treatment - operations that he should have had - were withheld. The doctors tried to make out that he was too old or unfit for them. One of the things that hurt me most when I went up there related to the question of medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">One day he was completely out of it and I asked the nurse: "Why is my Dad so out of it? Why is he sedated?" He was never distressed, violent or a problem. As he had become immobile, he was never a flight risk. He had never tried to run out of the hospital. When the nurse gave me her answer, it was as if it was normal; I could not believe the culture that had been created in the health service was to provide medication. She said to me, "Your Dad was singing all night." I could not believe the health service had decided to over-medicate to shut my father up because he had been singing to get through the night, the fact that he was not in his own home or bed, or the fact that he might have been hallucinating. What I had taught him to do every time he felt he was hallucinating was to sing and they had sedated him for doing so. He was not the only person to whom it was happening. There are family members who do not realise their older relatives are being medicated unnecessarily. It is an attack on their agency, autonomy and human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> There is also the withholding of medication. I worked in hostels and remember witnessing a worker withholding HIV medication from someone to try to curb their behaviour because it was chaotic. They withheld vital medication to try to stop them from behaving in that manner. It was scary and so sad to see. The Bill is important on many levels. We have far to go in protecting vulnerable persons. The withholding of medication is an abuse of human rights. I look forward to seeing how the Bill can be improved and made stronger. I thank Senator Colette Kelleher. I did not realise until today how many areas it touched. It was only when everyone started to talk I realised it was so far-reaching. Other Senators have given it their support. I look forward to it being enacted and implemented, I hope within the next 12 months, but even 12 months is too long as how many more older people will be abused in that time?</p>

          <p eId="para_442">Goodness me, it will be hard to capture it all in five minutes. I will come to what the Minister of State said at the end of my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> There was a fantastic endorsement by Senator John Dolan. Last night we received a briefing and one of the points Mervyn Taylor of Sage made was that instead of expressing indignation, which we all express and are good at here - I am getting even better at it - we should introduce legislation. It is about learning lessons such as the painful lesson we learned from the situation involving the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. The Bill is about all of the lessons we have learned and all of the situations we have come across in our working lives, including those when we acted and those when we failed to act. It is about ensuring we understand what abuse is and know what to do when we see it, including how to stop it. I really appreciate what Senator John Dolan said.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Senator Colm Burke said the Bill had been carefully drafted and opened up an important discussion. If we have done nothing else, we have opened up a serious and important discussion about vulnerable adults and how we live our lives. Many years ago, when I was a community worker in Finglas, nobody had heard of the sexual abuse of children. It was an accidental injury. Now we know that it happens. In the same way, we are transforming our understanding of a problem, the scale of which we do not fully appreciate.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I thank Senator Keith Swanick for endorsing and co-signing the Bill and sharing not only the shame felt at what had happened in Áras Attracta but also the view that we should try to do something about it, including highlighting the importance of independent advocates. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Senator Victor Boyhan talked about the legislation empowering us to respond by providing for clear pathways. He also said there should not be an undue delay in bringing it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Senator Máire Devine talked about the elements of awareness, understanding procedures, good practice, mandatory reporting and the need for clarity when abuse was noted. I would welcome suggestions for improvements. The Bill is a good starting point, but it needs more work.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> I appreciate Senator Frances Black's concrete examples of vulnerable persons, including those living in isolated rural communities, being subject to abuse, including from dealers at the door. Senator Lynn Ruane spoke eloquently about her father in referring to the the under-use and overuse of medication, both of which are equally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> There was also a great endorsement by Senator Michael McDowell, a lawyer, and I was scared. There are a lot of them here.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">I am not a lawyer; I did not have enough points to do law and did social studies instead. I was helped greatly by and received support from Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke and Senator Colm Burke also. I believe we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in what is going on in homes and institutions. This is about not being drowned by what will come through. There is a need for a clear pathway because we can do better for adults, as we have done for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I hope I have recognised all of the contributions made. I really appreciate the fact that there is cross-party support for the Bill which I will not let languish. It might go for pre-legislative scrutiny, but it will not stay with the committee because we need to bring it back as the matter is urgent.</p>
