#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I welcome everyone to the meeting and thank the witnesses for attending.The joint committee's remit covers communications, marine, and natural resources.  It was with great sadness that we learned yesterday evening that the trawler, Pere Charles, was reported missing with five crew members as it was returning to Dunmore East. The members of this committee have always held the fishing industry and fishermen in the highest regard; they undertake one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs.  While there may still be hope, the chance of finding survivors is fading.  I offer the sympathy of this committee to the families of the crew of the Pere Charles: the skipper, Tom Hennessy; his uncle, Pat Hennessy; Billy "The Squid" O'Connor; Pat Cody; and a Ukrainian national whose name has not been released, and also to Michael Walsh, owner of the Pere Charles. We all know Michael Walsh, who has been before this committee on many occasions when he ably represented the South and East Fishermen's Organisation.  Knowing Michael and the families of the crew, this must be a devastating blow to them.  I ask Senator Kenneally to pass the prayers of the committee to them.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Thank you, Chairman, for allowing this matter to be raised.  We are here primarily to speak about broadcasting matters but, as you have said, marine is part of our remit and it is appropriate that we think about the unfortunate five people who are lost at sea, and their distraught families.  The owner of the boat, Mr. Michael Walsh, represents the South and East Fishermen's Organisation and has sat opposite us at this committee on many occasions.  While Michael was not on board last night, he was out searching for the missing crewmen and, as members can imagine, is extremely upset at what has happened.  When I go to Dunmore East later, I will convey the committee's feelings to Michael.  It came as no surprise to read in the paper this morning that the boat was in tip-top condition, having been refurbished with state-of-the-art safety equipment.  That is the way Michael operates.  It appears that what has occurred was a tragic accident.One of the missing crewmen, Billy O'Connor, is someone I know well having been in school with him.  At this time, we should think of the emergency services and the other crews who are searching at sea this morning.  Let us hope and pray that all of them return safely.  It is appropriate to think of the five missing crewmen and their families at this very sad time.

It brings home to us all the reality of the hardships, dangers and trauma associated with making a living from the sea.  On countless occasions over the years, we have met in various committees fishermen's representatives and this morning our hearts go out to their families and the industry in general.  This tragedy serves to remind us of the harsh reality and perils associated with life at sea.

I was in Dunmore East on the October bank holiday weekend where I spent the time watching the activity at the port and the boats come and go.  It is a tragic and incredibly sad event for the port which has lost a number of boats in recent years.  It highlights the risks and difficulties associated with the profession of fishing.

Michael Walsh is a past pupil of mine and a very good Gaelic football player who played on a successful team I trained some time ago.  I spoke to him very late last night.  He is devastated.  He told me one of the occupants of the boat had stopped working at sea as his father drowned around this time last year.  He had gone to work for An Bord Sol√°thair an Leictreachais and returned yesterday to be with friends and have a bit of fun.  That is what the sea does.  Those of us not associated with the sea are not sufficiently mindful of the great sacrifices these people make for very little money.  It is not about money with people like this, but about a way of life.  I spent 21 years teaching in the area and this time last year in another tragedy a past pupil of mine known as "Skin" Colfer lost his life.  Before that again, another past pupil died.I record my own appreciation of the contribution those fishermen make to the Wexford economy.  Wexford is not a manufacturing county and relies very much on farming, fishing and tourism.  It is a very sad day and I hope and pray there will be some relief for the families of those for whom we are searching.

I am reminded of the great line by Yeats about the "murderous innocence of the sea".  It is a very dangerous environment.  We saw in the television reports last night the difficult conditions in which people must go to sea, especially the rescue services.  It is terribly tragic.  As Deputy Tony Dempsey said, the sea represents not just a livelihood, but a lifetime of tradition.  Time and again, despite the hardships, people face going to sea and this event is one of the deeply tragic consequences.  My heart goes out to the families and the whole community, which is devastated.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome everyone in attendance for the joint committee's continued public hearings on the draft ministerial proposals for broadcasting legislation.  I am especially pleased to welcome all those who tuned into the proceedings yesterday as they were broadcast live on the Internet.Today's first session deals with RTE and TG4.  We will cover fair trade practices, the Audience Council and the staff obligation of the public service broadcaster.  In examining fair trade practices, members are concerned to explore the rights of those who make programmes under commission.  Members are conscious that the Audience Council is the body which gives the listener a voice.  In a changed single regulatory environment, it is considered important to explore what voice the listener will have in future.  Finally, the members consider it important to examine the implications for the staff of the public service broadcaster as RTE moves from being answerable to the RTE Authority to being subject to the various Acts dealing with companies.I request that all mobile telephones be switched off and draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that while members have absolute privilege, the same level of privilege does not extend to those appearing before the committee.  The committee cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it.  Members are reminded that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I do not want any abuse of that rule today.For the information of those joining us on the Internet, we are discussing heads 107, 108, 91 and 100 in this session.  We are live online at www.econsultation.ie.  Deputy Eamon Ryan will begin with the first group of questions on fair trade practices.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I will run three or four questions into one slightly lengthy initial opener.  I praised RTE yesterday for the investment which has been made in programme-making on foot of the increase in the licence fee.  There is no doubt it has had beneficial effects on the quality of broadcasting and the development of the independent sector which has never been stronger.  However, my comments today will be very critical of RTE's trading arrangements with that very sector.  If there are representatives in attendance from the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild or of independent screen producers, I would be interested to hear their comments.My understanding is that RTE opposes the introduction of a code on fair trading practices which might change the current scenario in which it holds a 100% interest in the majority of material it commissions.  It would be preferable if the organisation were to recognise that the financial investment in a programme is not the only investment and that creative investment is just as valuable an asset as the financial contribution.  This could be done by transferring a proportion of rights to independent producers, screen producers or screen writers.  Does RTE regard such a development as appropriate?  What type of mechanism does Screen Producers Ireland seek?  Should we follow the example of Ofcom in Britain or adopt a variation of that model?From conversations with people involved in this sector, I understand that if the independent sector had a percentage share in programming it would be more ambitious and dynamic in selling the programming products into international markets.  Ireland has a distinct advantage in that programmes are, by and large, produced in English.  I understand RTE does not take a dynamic or progressive approach to selling programming produced here.  It may even be in the organisation's interests to relinquish a share because such a step would lead to an increase in exports and while its return would no longer be 100%, it would be higher.  If RTE does not support this idea, I ask its representatives to explain its reasons.  I am interested in hearing from the representative of Screen Producers Ireland whether my brief summary of the position is accurate.Yesterday, the joint committee discussed the fact that RTE rather than the commercial sector is the dominant commissioning body.  I understand from discussions with those involved in the sector that one of the other unfortunate difficulties experienced by the independent sector is the nature of its relationship with RTE.  On one side is a powerful single body with all the money, while on the other is a multiplicity of smaller producers.  In such a relationship individual producers will lack power and, as a result, cut prices to the bone to secure a commission because the market is so competitive.  This is not necessarily in the long-term interest of good programme making.The experience of independent producers over the past three or four years is that RTE takes decisions in its annual decision making round on which programmes to commission two or three months late.  This sets the whole industry back by three or four months and forces companies to play catch up.  In addition, they must work to tightly priced commercial deadlines because of the imbalance in the market, with a single buyer dealing with a large number of sellers.  I ask witnesses to comment.I also request a response on the appropriateness of the code in specific areas of expenditure.  For example, the independent fund commissioned within the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will have an annual budget of, I believe, roughly ‚Ç¨8 million, a not insignificant sum.  When one considers that the Irish Film Board has a total annual budget of approximately ‚Ç¨12 million, the ‚Ç¨8 million figure constitutes a large chunk of commissioning money.  Is it appropriate that a company seeking funding from the BCI must first have the broadcaster on board?  Does this requirement not give RTE too much power over a large part of independent programming funding?  It effectively gives the broadcaster editorial and commissioning control over the process.These are some of the problems in the sector.  A code, as set out in the proposed legislation, provides an opportunity to iron them out.  Why not give the independent producers a percentage share in programming, as is the case in the United Kingdom?  Perhaps we could go further than our counterparts in Britain.  Should a code be introduced setting down timeframes within which RTE must make decisions and establishing a mechanism to shift power to the producers to address the imbalanced relationship between them and RTE and ensure the former are paid properly?  This is the only way to sustain a proper industry in the long run.  Why should the broadcaster be involved in the first phase of securing BCI funding for independent productions?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am the chair of the broadcasting subcommittee of Screen Producers Ireland which represents 150 independent film and television production companies.  I welcome the draft legislation on which SPI was in dialogue with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  We particularly welcome the introduction of head No. 107, a code of fair trading practice.  It is an important step forward.I agree with virtually everything Deputy Eamon Ryan said on the experiences of Screen Producers Ireland and its members in dealing with RTE.  The national broadcaster refuses to adopt the Ofcom model operating in the United Kingdom under which broadcasters are accorded only certain rights and the remaining rights in the programme are retained by the programme's creators.  In the United Kingdom and Ireland the producers are regarded as the creators of the programme.  Screen Producers Ireland has tried to persuade RTE to agree to an Ofcom-type arrangement but has, unfortunately, failed to do so.  As late as 9 January 2007 we received a letter from Clare Duignan, director of programmes in RTE television, in which she agreed to disagree with us, in other words, she stated RTE was not prepared to agree to our position on copyright ownership.  We have brought the matter as far as we can with the organisation but it has not agreed to follow a model similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom and other countries such as the United States.  Screen Producers Ireland will continue to try to persuade RTE to take this route.As regards the Deputy's comments on the commissioning process, RTE needs to improve the speed and timing of the process.  Commissions are awarded at a late stage and are cut to the bone in terms of price.  As a result, the quality of programming is in danger of suffering.  This is a difficulty.The Deputy is also correct on the BCI fund.  Although it amounts to ‚Ç¨8 million to ‚Ç¨10 million per annum, two or three years of funding were accumulated before the process was set in train, with the result that the commission has between ‚Ç¨20 million and ‚Ç¨30 million to spend on television programme production.  The establishment of this fund is welcome because it has engendered a small improvement in competition in the sector.  However, in the final analysis, the difficulty is with RTE as the dominant broadcaster.  To put the matter in context, RTE spends between ‚Ç¨60 million and ‚Ç¨70 million per annum on the independent television production sector.  When one compares this figure to the ‚Ç¨10 million per annum spent by the BCI and approximately ‚Ç¨12 million to ‚Ç¨15 million per annum spent by TG4 on the independent sector it is clear RTE has a dominant position in the market.Overall, approximately ‚Ç¨150 million per annum is spent on independent film and television production.  Internal expenditure by RTE on television programme production amounts to approximately ‚Ç¨200 million per annum.  These figures show that the industry is of major importance.  Ireland needs to be part of the information society and the digital content creation society.  Unless we step up to the plate in this area others will steal a march on us.  Ireland needs to have developed, sophisticated industries able to pay the wages and salaries people deserve.  To achieve this, we need the right industries with the right focus.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I am basking in the shade today.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	14	He got us all into trouble over having two television licences.  He is very greedy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I will answer the four points raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  In terms of recognition of the creative investment of the producer, this investment is recognised in that producers are paid to make the programmes.  They are paid a production fee and if they work on the programme, they are paid as producers.  They also receive a share of revenues from the exploitation of the programme.  Their creative input into the programme is, therefore, recognised.On the question of using the UK model, the market in the United Kingdom is substantially different from the Irish market.  We would be better off examining countries such as Austria and Switzerland where the position is similar to that here in that their respective public service broadcasters compete against competitors in the domestic market and also face substantial external competition.  Austria has German channels whereas we have the BBC.  The United Kingdom model should not be applied to RTE because the markets are different.In terms of exploitation of programmes it is not the case that RTE has total control and decides everything that happens with programmes.  Under our new terms of trade we have agreed with SPI that if a proposal is made to exploit a programme separate from the broadcast on RTE, we will discuss it with the producer and decide on the best deal.  It is a partnership in that sense.  It is not a case of RTE controlling things and producers getting no money out of it nor having any control over it.  I want to make that clear.As to whether the retention or ownership of rights by producers would make them more ambitious and dynamic, we carried out a test a few years ago in which we agreed with SPI to get an established international UK sales company to take our product and try to sell it.  It was a three-year deal but very few sales were achieved.  At the end of the three-year period, when asked if it wished to continue, the company declined on the basis that the material was not internationally saleable.  Unfortunately, the notion that there is a big market for the product we make is not necessarily true.  There is a market for formats and our arrangements with SPI on that is that if a producer owns the format then he or she is free to go abroad to exploit and sell that format.  We do not control that side of things.  The producer has the format rights.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I am sorry.  What happens is that RTE-IPU puts out rounds during the year to which people respond.  There is an ongoing process.  Situations may arise at short notice where we have a slot and money is available.  In such cases we go to the market and look for someone to make a programme quickly.  I realise such a scenario is not perfect but it happens in the industry.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	18	What I hear from people in the industry is that it happens every year.  It is said that everything is done on Christmas Eve.  Panic then sets in as the budget has to be spent.  Projects are three months late and people hear about it at the last minute.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I accept that may happen in some cases but it is not the general rule.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Let us hear from Mr. √ì Gallch√≥ir of TG4 about his experiences in regard to this matter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	We have similar terms of trade with the independent production sector as RTE.  We are currently in negotiations with SPI.  We believe the broadcaster should retain broadcasting rights for the island of Ireland in perpetuity.  In return, the independent producer would retain ownership of the programming for exploitation.  We will continue our negotiations with SPI.Regarding the BCI, we welcome the fund and the additionality it brings but we feel it is important for a broadcaster to be on board before the submission goes to the BCI.  The danger is that submissions may be approved but no broadcaster may be interested in showing the programme.  It is important for the public that all the material produced by the BCI is shown on national television.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	What experience does Mr. McMunn have in dealing with independent producers?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As discussed yesterday, we have obligations which we meet.  We do not spend anywhere near the same as RTE or TG4 as we do not have the funding.  The rights to be accorded involve a policy decision at Government level.  Since the Ofcom model in the UK has freed up some rights, we now have deals with independent producers in the UK which would not have been possible previously.  This is an area that requires more examination.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Would Mr. O'Keeffe like to comment on the questions posed by Deputy Eamon Ryan and the replies already made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	We support the principle of the proposed code of fair trade as set out in the heads of the Bill.  We do not take issue with it.  The objective of the programme fund is to fund new programmes.  Within the legislation and the approval we got from the European Commission, it was an absolute prerequisite that there would be a commitment from a broadcaster on the basis that if one provides money for a programme that is not broadcast subsequently, one can ask if the money has been well spent.  There is no leeway on that.  We must have a commitment from a broadcaster that a programme will be broadcast.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	What is to stop RTE with a possible budget of ‚Ç¨60 million for programmes having a programme made from the ‚Ç¨8 million BCI budget?  It can go to a producer and offer ‚Ç¨50,000 for a programme and leave it to him or her to seek the balance from the BCI.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That is a matter for RTE.  Our concern with the fund revolves around its objectives and the type of programming for which funding will be provided.  We assess everything on an open basis.  We are about to complete our third round of applications.  The applications we receive are assessed independently.  Money is allocated for programming that is broadcast on whichever broadcast service has agreed to take part.  We take an open approach.  We will provide funding as long as programming is in line with the objectives of the scheme and is broadcast on a service, irrespective of what that service may be.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Let me return to the question of RTE.  We should compare ourselves with Austria or Finland rather than the UK.  Given the immigrant English speaking population in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Irish programming must be of a broader interest.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I accept the Deputy's point but that is not the experience.  We may have such a view in Ireland but that is not the case internationally.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Screen producers can be reasonably substantial companies with expertise and international reputations.  What do we have to lose because we are building up an industry that will have an ability to export?  Why would we not give them 20% or 30% and let them try to sell their product, given that we are not selling much programming currently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As I explained, we have an arrangement with them to allow them to do that.  We encourage producers to try to make sales and come back to us to do the deal.  We will get 50%.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	32	How can there be any incentive if RTE has 100% ownership rights?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The incentive is the 50% share.  The producers will also get a sales fee.  The rights are separate from the income from the exploitation of those rights.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Rights are significant when one looks at Riverdance.  There are examples of where there would be an incentive for people to try and sell programmes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Riverdance was not a 100% RTE commissioned programme.  We are talking about programmes fully paid for by RTE.  In such cases we pay the producer a fee, etc.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	37	We have a catalogue of programming we try to sell every day.  Unfortunately, the market is not out there.

They said they would do us a deal and do it for free.  That is what we are up against.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Does Mr. Hickey wish to contribute again?  Two members are offering.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	41	There is a cause and effect problem here.  First, producers do not own the rights, RTE owns the rights.  RTE has now agreed it will not sell the rights without the producer's consent but, equally, the producer cannot sell the rights without RTE's consent so there is a deadlock.  It does not do anybody any good.  Ultimately, the problem is the producers need an incentive to go out and sell their products.  We share revenues but if one has to go cap in hand to RTE every time to ask permission to sell a programme, that is difficult and it is not fair.  We want a new code of fair practice.  The United Kingdom has already done this to the great benefit of its producers.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	42	We had an experience in 2004 when going to Australia representing the committee when we were looking at broadcasting.  We went to Chile two years ago.  We had a good discussion with screen producers down under where they have a different model.  Is Mr. Sweeney familiar with that model?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	43	They have a rights model arrangement which allows producers to retain rights.  In general terms, in Australia producers are able to retain rights.  The organisation in Australia is called the Screen Producers Association of Australia and our equivalent is called Screen Producers Ireland.  There is much more competition between broadcasters in Australia because they have a much more diverse broadcasting sector than in Ireland.  They have better opportunities to negotiate rights and a better regulatory arrangement.  The Australian model is very complicated.

At the time of commissioning a programme, would it not be possible to agree on a price that is somewhat removed from that which currently prevails to allow the producer to retain some rights?  Has the Competition Authority made any comment on this process?  It appears that there is a slight infringement in terms of competition and restrictive practice.  Does the measure apply to all programmes or is it selective?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The market in Ireland is very small.  Therefore, if we were to create a business model with producers in which we did not put up all the money for the production on the grounds that they would come up with the balance from international sales or otherwise, most projects would not be feasible.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	That is not what I had in mind.  I presume that if RTE or any other body is buying the full rights, root and branches, to a production, it must pay more for it than it would pay if it were buying a product with rights attaching elsewhere.  Is this the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	47	If we acquire programmes from the United States, for example, we obviously pay less than we would if we were commissioning a programme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	48	For the cost of producing a programme, RTE acquires all rights pertaining to it and does not pay any additional money, although it is also acquiring international television rights or international DVD rights.  It retains all such rights without having to make any additional payment to the producer.  Therefore, the Deputy is correct that it does not pay anything extra.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The payment we make covers the costs of creating all those rights.  Flowing on from the cost of making the programme are all the other rights.  There is no extra cost involved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The creator is entitled to have his rights recognised and the Deputy is correct that if the creator employs additional creativity, which is so important to the making of the programme, he is entitled to own it and benefit therefrom.  This is the creator's trade.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	51	A battle ensued for several years over the rights and entitlements of contributing artists.  This was resolved a long time ago.  How does this tie in with the existing process?  It appears that the artists contributing to a programme would still have rights.  The production agency would have rights that would extend across the board and they would have to be recognised in any event.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Absolutely, but they are, in a way, removed from the producer.  In the case of an independent commission, we would hire the producer, who would then hire the actors, musicians or other performers.  They would obviously get paid and share in the income that would accrue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The producers, artists, composers and all the people to whom the Deputy refers, including the actors, musicians and scriptwriters, do not get additional payments if the programmes do not sell outside Ireland.  The problem is that RTE does not sell them satisfactorily.  If they were sold, not only would the producers get paid but so too would the performers, composers, writers, directors and all the others involved in the making of the programme.  They are paid for the initial work but they would make more money if the programme was sold internationally.

I am worried that the spirit of the legislation with which we are dealing is not being honoured.  I am interested in hearing the response of all sectors.  If 100% of the rights to a programme are owned by the commissioning body, which is RTE in so many instances, how can one say the sector is independent?  Is RTE not just subcontracting?I was interested in the views of Enterprise Ireland on the development of this sector.  Existing practice has not led to sufficient development or a system sufficiently robust to allow a proper, independent television production sector to develop.  It is a case of the dominant incumbent controlling everything.The exchange on the deadlock involving the independent screen producers and production companies was interesting.  Unfortunately, RTE is by and large commanding everything.  The system clearly has not worked.  It is not satisfactory from the point of view of the licensee that the sector is not being developed sufficiently.  I do not know if there are delegates present from Enterprise Ireland who made comments on the ability to develop the sector.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	63	In order to build a company, one needs income.  Rights and money are separate issues.  If one is paid to make a programme, one is receiving 50% of the revenue from its exploitation and this is what one uses to build one's company.  Owning rights is no use unless one is receiving income from their exploitation.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	70	What has Mr. Hickey to say about that aspect?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The difficulty is that unless the producers themselves are in control of the situation and able to make the sales themselves, the system does not work.  If one must ask permission of RTE every time, one is disincentivised.  It is not just a question of having a passive share in revenue.  The programmes are created by us and we want to make them better so we can sell them internationally.Most television programmes do not sell internationally.  This holds true for every country in the world but there are always a few exceptions.  "Riverdance", to which the Deputy referred, is a classic example of an exception that truly proves how a small six-minute programme, produced creatively, can make a global impact.  The production companies produce such programmes and they want to own the rights to them so they can go forward.  The fair trade proposals are welcome and we would like to see them strengthened in the legislation.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The committee is extremely concerned about the submission by Enterprise Ireland.  While it does not criticise anybody in particular, it makes the very strong point that television producers must fully exploit opportunities to secure export revenue from the sale of their productions in international markets and that any issue regarding the ownership of rights is reserved to best support this objective.  Enterprise Ireland regards television production as a growing industry.Just before Christmas, the members of the committee attended a presentation by media producers, including screen producers.  I was amazed that there were 10,000 to 12,000 people involved in the various facets of the industry.  I am sure the officials from the Department will take note of the points made by members and that this matter will be teased out in the Bill.

If cultural barriers can be crossed by "Killinascully", imagine what else can be done.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	74	"Killinascully" has done very well in Ireland but has not performed as well internationally.

I am sure those drafting the legislation will take into consideration all of the submissions made and the exchange of views here today.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	78	It is not appreciated that many of the programmes commissioned in Ireland are not commercially viable; if there was no State support, they would not be commissioned at all.  That is why the committee might ask TV3 or the other commercial broadcasters why they do not commission programmes in that way.  There is a presumption that because a programme can be sold internationally it will sell internationally.  There are many other issues to do with why an independent production sector may or may not be-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	80	There is a misapprehension that we want to choke it but that is not the case.  Everyone would be keen to see more.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I dispute the point that home-produced programming is not commercial.  I go back to what I said in praise of RTE: we have seen local productions receiving money, attracting the figures and commercial revenue results.  If independent production companies were not used, RTE would not have the same viewer figures.  That is what makes it commercially viable, as well as the licence fee.  To say we are doing people a favour because a programme is not commercially viable is misleading; the production companies are doing RTE a favour because they work hard on tight budgets, even though RTE does not give them any recognition by granting them the rights.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	82	It is a false assumption that all programmes necessarily are commercially viable; they are not.  The concept of a public service broadcaster is precisely that programmes will be made whether they attract large audience figures.  Even if they do attract large audience numbers, in a state of 4 million many programmes will not be commercially viable, which is why some of our competitors do not commission home produced programming.  We must balance this with the need to develop a healthy independent production sector.  It is misplaced, however, to say it is all in one place.Chairman: We could spend all day on this issue but the work programme has been laid out and we must stop at this point.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Mr. Paul Kinsella from the Audience Council's existing structure is here and Deputy Fiona O'Malley has indicated that she would like to put some questions to him.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am concerned about the Minister giving himself such strong powers, particularly as regards the audience council.  Do the delegates see this as dangerous?  The legislation for the audience council appears to be based on the BBC format which is now being jettisoned.  Is that wise?The audience council only relates to RTE.  That does not make sense; the audience is reached by all broadcast media, particularly the independent sector.  Does that sector believe an audience council which acts as an umbrella with all broadcast facilities is appropriate?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We will hear from Mr. Kinsella and then go to Ms Curtin and Mr. Dooley, before asking the broadcasters their views on the audience council.  Is Mr. Kinsella a public representative?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	No.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I have been badly advised.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The audience council has been in existence for four years and worked well.  It has 22 members that are split into two sectors: individual members, whom I represent, and a number of bodies such as the Council of Churches and the IFA, which each have one representative.  We meet four times a year to discuss recent programming on RTE radio and television.  We also request audiences with people from RTE to discuss issues such as future programming.Linking with the last point made by the SPI and RTE, the submission by the SPI refers to high quality programming.  As a licence payer, this is important to me.  Programming is sold by the SPA in Australia.  Therefore, we, as the audience, accept that we get a grade A programme such as "Home and Away" at 6.30 p.m. but as part of that package we must also accept a programme like "Blue Heelers" which is seen as a grade C programme that would be broadcast at midnight or 2 a.m.  As an audience with shift workers and so on, the difficulty lies in the fact that we must accept this programming quality.I take Deputy O'Malley's point about the lack of representation from TV3 or TG4 and that the input from RTE Lyric FM is not as great as it should be.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	89	RTE runs the audience council set up; is that not the case?  We will hear from Mr. Quinn how it is working before going to the other broadcasters.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The audience council was an initiative RTE took four years ago of its own volition.  It came up with a model where there would be 11 members representing various social partners married to representatives of the viewing and listening audience.  To that end it engaged external recruitment consultants.  A public competition was held with a brief to recruit viewers and listeners from the EU constituencies, Dublin, Leinster, Munster, Connacht-Ulster and Northern Ireland.  The audience council has 11 representative members, ten viewer members and an ex officio member, who is also a chairman of the authority‚Äôs sub-committee on programmes.  The council is entering its fourth year.  It selects its own chairman from its members.  The chair has rotated and it is no secret that the current chairman is not prepared to go forward next year.The council meets five times a year and discusses all manner of programmes.  The council will set its own homework.  At a meeting it will be agreed to examine, say, drama programmes.  Several members will then research this topic and make a presentation on it at the subsequent meeting.  Senior management of those areas that are examined are in attendance for the presentation.  RTE has a programme in educating the audience council into how it works in areas such as broadcasting, publishing and Internet activities.  The council receives presentations on sports programming.Members are free to raise any issues they so wish.  Deputy Fiona O' Malley referred to the BBC audience council which the Bill uses as its model.  The BBC, however, is pulling away from that model and returning to the current RTE type.  RTE feels the Bill's proposals in this regard are not very democratic as the Minister will appoint the council and its size is reduced.  It takes away the ability for the general public to apply for council membership.  Under the current system, people such as Mr. Kinsella are free to apply to the council.  RTE feels that the BBC route is the wrong way.  It is regrettable and we hope the committee will recommend a change in the legislation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	91	S√≠lim go bhfuil s√© t√°bhachtach a r√° gur √© an pobal cro√≠ na craolt√≥ireachta.  The public is at the core of everything TG4 does as a public service broadcaster.  It goes without saying that monitoring what the audience wants is crucial.  Every broadcaster must be connected with its audience and that can work in many ways.  Our comhairle is a council and comprises people nominated from various bodies and groups.  Its function has been to advise TG4 management and the RTE authority, give feedback on the station's schedule and make proposals on forthcoming programming.  In that way, all our programmes are shown to the comhairle on a general basis.  All TG4 commissioning editors have made presentations to the comhairle.An audience council must reflect all of a broadcaster's audiences.  As discussed at the committee yesterday, not all television audiences are resident in the jurisdiction.  Given the particular importance of TG4 to the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, any future structure must reflect that community.  The audience council should be open to application to members of the public rather than be nominated by a body or a Minister.  TG4 did not respond to this part of the Bill because it takes it as a given that an audience council is a good entity.  The models of appointment are best left to wiser councils than ourselves.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	92	We regard this proposal as a regressive step.  It is a move away from public ownership of broadcasting and in direct conflict with the principles with which the committee operates.  There is no reason why an audience council must physically meet.  It could operate through e-consultation and there are several imaginative ways in which the RTE model could be developed.  The RTE model in terms of the election and expression of public interest will be used for the proposed press council.  This regressive step is reflective of a tone in the Bill that centralises at ministerial level a number of appointments in key areas.It is important that public involvement relates to public service broadcasting.  During yesterday's proceedings, it was asked what is public service broadcasting.  I was reminded of the Louis Armstrong response to the same question about jazz.  If one had to ask, one did not understand it.  My answer to the question is one will know when one does not have it.  An audience council is important in defining public areas.  As a former regional newspaper editor, I understand it is important in ensuring a public service broadcaster is not focussed only on the Dublin area.The Bill seeks to make the audience council a statutory body.  There is nothing preventing other broadcasting organisations setting up audience councils independently.  As the Bill may never see the light of day, other commercial broadcasting organisations could consider following the RTE lead.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Mr. Quinn claims RTE established its Audience Council on its own volition.  It was set up on its own volition but as part of its application for a 43% television licence fee increase.  It stated if it was to receive such a large increase it needed to be more accountable in the use of public funds.  The audience council is linked to the fact that RTE receives a large amount of public funding.TV3 does not receive public funding but is accountable under a statutory regime through the BCI.  Our genre of programming and general performance is monitored by the BCI and the process has worked to date.  It concerns me that there should an audience council for all broadcasters.  Would someone dare suggest that there should a newspaper content council?  TV3 is accountable through legislation to be independent and impartial and is regulated by the BCI.  As commercial broadcasters we must give the public what it wants.  If we do not, we do not get viewers and in turn we do not get advertising.  I agree with the need for an audience council for a State-funded broadcaster.  There is a mechanism in place to ensure the commercial sector is appropriately regulated.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Several of the local independent radio stations have established listener forums on a voluntary basis.  It is good for reflecting listeners' views.  The principle of audience councils is good, but I am not sure whether they should be voluntary or statutory.  There is certainly a mix, and TV3 clearly does not have one, unlike several local radio stations.  As a general principle, it is not a bad idea, but I am not sure whether it should be statutory.

The census over the years has shown many people recording some competence in Irish.  Most people in the education system who speak Irish every day are learning the language.  There has been criticism of the curriculum, but that is a different argument and if we are to protect the constitutional status of Irish, we must reflect it in all legislation.

If there is talk of an audience council, the language must be protected at that level.  That might mean having people on it who are competent to deal with the Irish-language public, those who are l√≠ofa, those learning and those with an interest in learning.  That must be reflected and we should always ensure a quota or requirement so that those appointed to State bodies have that competence.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We will move on quickly, since we are behind time.  I note that several observations and submissions were made regarding staff, accounts and audits.  Perhaps Mr. Dooley and Ms Curtin might tell us whether they believe the Bill provides sufficient guidance on transparency and recruitment procedures at RTE and TG4.  Should sections 3 and 4 be amended to add "and as agreed in collective agreements with recognised trade unions"?  We were looking through certain parts of the submissions and wondering whether section 5 should be amended to add "circumstances outlined and agreed in collective agreements with recognised trade unions".  Would Ms Curtin like to comment on that point?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Yes.  In recent years we in the trade union group and individual unions have negotiated agreements with RTE that have by and large been honoured by both sides.  The result can be seen in our industrial relations.  We have enjoyed an extremely good industrial relations climate.  We would be worried if the phrase that we suggested was left out of the Bill.  We would be concerned that at some stage the situation might develop in RTE where one or other side might not honour agreements, seek to recruit in their absence or refuse to negotiate future agreements.  For that reason, we feel that if the phrase is inserted under the headings outlined, it will provide for an obligation in line with the current partnership ethos ensuring that the two sides work together to achieve good industrial relations in RTE.  I ask that it be included.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Mr. Hayes raised a question regarding audits and accounts.  There were several submissions from RTE regarding some of those areas.  What specific clarifications are required under the proposed audits and accounts section of this Bill and what additional measures would ensure the desired transparency regarding RTE's total expenditure and the independent production account expenditure?  I believe this was raised by Mr. Hickey of the SPI.  Is he present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	This is head No. 100.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Our primary concern in that regard is technical.  Essentially, we make the observation that if RTE is to be turned into a company, which is the intent behind this Bill, its account and audit requirements should be absolutely ad idem with all other companies.  In seeking to provide additional clarification, the Bill, or the document before us, unintentionally intermingles the normal statutory obligations with very specific ones of a regulatory nature.  Purely from a perspective of technical accounting, that is not a good idea, since they should be dealt with separately.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I am sure that it will be taken on board.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Our only concern in this regard is to ensure that transparency and accountability be guaranteed regarding the cost of production and programmes produced inside RTE, as with independent television production, which has accounted for virtually every cent of expenditure.  In that way, there will be a fair and level playing field for internal and independent producers competing for programming funds.  At present, the RTE accounts do not detail the cost of programmes such as "The Late Late Show", "The Tubridy Show" or "Fair City", which is probably fairly expensive.  There should be transparency and accountability, with a level playing field for the two.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	110	That is fine.  We have taken that point on board.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Does the production of the audited accounts not have to comply with standard audit procedures applicable across the board in the commercial and every other sector?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We have gone well beyond that point.  Unfortunately, the drafting of the sections intermingles regulatory and normal accounting standards.  For example, it mentions cost-accounting principles and decisions by the Minister.  When the auditors come to interpret that, they cannot do so by reference to generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, IFRS, since those principles have not been enunciated anywhere.  While I accept that they have been included for entirely genuine reasons, it could result in some very difficult situations.Our view is that one should try to ensure that the reporting obligations imposed on RTE in the first instance are exactly the same as those imposed on any other public body.  They should be objectively measurable and capable of being reported in exactly the same way.  That is how it should be, and if one intends to include additional information requirements, that should be done separately.That is the norm in such areas as telecommunications, where several companies compete, some of which have been defined as having a significant market presence.  ComReg, the Competition Authority or some other regulatory body may get involved and prescribe certain requirements.  Accounting separation, for example, is imposed in a regulatory situation.  However, the company still produces all its information in exactly the same way as any other and it is all objectively measurable.  As with all other companies, the information is produced separately.

Am I correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Yes, I agree with that point.  The issues raised by the audience council are brought back to the RTE editorial board for discussion.  The audience council then receives feedback on the issues.  The council has its own report in RTE's annual report and its members meet regularly with the director general and the programmes sub-committee.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I thank everybody for their contribution.  This session has run over time, but it was important to make these points.  We will suspend for five minutes and when we resume, we will discuss the safeguards and guarantees for the Irish language, as well as the independence and remit of TG4.  There will be a translation provided via headphones for anybody who requires it.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The second session deals with the safeguards and guarantees for the Irish language, as well as the independence and remit of TG4.  Members of the committee were surprised at the number of observations received regarding the status of the Irish language and culture.  The strength of our culture and language is important in how we legislate for both and broadcasting must reflect this aspect.Some of our guests may wish to speak in Irish and I have asked a couple of Deputies to lead the way.

I have a background in sport and I am aware of the tremendous contribution that RTE, TG4, Radio na Gaeltachta and local radio stations have made to the growth of the GAA.  Names like Brian Carthy and Mich√°el √ì Hehir are known throughout Ireland and beyond.  I have also been impressed with the work of RTE in competing with the BBC, as this State has a population of about 4 million, while the BBC has a market of 55 million people.  The GAA and minority sports have depended on RTE and other broadcasters for their growth.  The language also depends on them.T√°im chun tagairt spesialta a dh√©anamh do chuid a d√≥, cabadail 24: aidhmeanna √©ags√∫la an √∫dar√°is.

Like previous speakers, I acknowledge the importance of TG4, its function and independence.  I compliment the station on its work in promoting the Irish language and culture.  Earlier Deputy Dempsey referred to the major contribution made by various individuals in the sports arena.  Previously I mentioned how they had done a tremendous job by removing the elitism that often surrounded the language.  This is of enormous importance and a tremendous job has been done in this regard.  I wish to ascertain whether TG4 is satisfied it has sufficient latitude to face the future, given its responsibility and remit regarding the Irish language and culture.  Do its representatives believe the legislation as proposed will be sufficient to allow it to develop its responsibility and remit to the required extent?My last point is simply a personal view.  Yesterday the joint committee discussed subtitling and I am unsure whether it is of any benefit in encouraging people to learn the language or become immersed in the culture.  Too much attention is given to reading the translations, at the expense of absorbing oneself in the totality of what is being presented.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	As the Deputy recognised, perhaps for the first time we have tried to put Irish into the mainstream of Irish life.  While this has been done by breaking quite a few rules regarding the normal mode of Irish language broadcasting, it has worked to a considerable degree.  As Mr. √ì Gallch√≥ir noted, as our budget is extremely tight, we are highly restricted in comparison with other public service broadcasters.  A key factor in enabling us to continue the work we have done in the past ten years would be to fix the budget in order that we could look forward for a three year period in the knowledge that our resources were sufficient to fulfil our remit.As for learning the language, I am unsure whether people learn languages by watching television.  No studies show this to be the case.  As someone who has learned Irish, audio-visual aids are excellent for this purpose, but perhaps not always as part of a linear schedule.  One can create audio-visual programmes that may be found on the worldwide web and played repeatedly or put on one's iPod and listened to time and again.  This is probably the best way forward in learning the Irish language, rather than believing we are obliged to put out a half hour programme at 7.30 p.m. for six weeks and then forgetting about it.  The creation of audio-visual projects, directed at a specific target rather than a public broadcast, may be the best way forward in this regard.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Before Mr. O'Keeffe makes his comments, the joint committee has received a considerable number of submissions on the constitution of the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's board.  I am conscious he represents the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, rather than the new board.  However, can he comment on whether there should be a proportionate number of people fluent i nGaeilge, as the BAI will be responsible for all broadcasting services?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Our submission did not particularly address that issue.  From the perspective of the Irish language, I wished to make a point regarding the responsibilities of and requirements on broadcasters in the independent sector.  We are involved with Foras na Gaeilge in a coiste which considers the establishment of programming initiatives as Gaeilge.  Ms N√≠ Bhroinn, who is secretary of the coiste, will give the committee an indication of some of the activities taking place in this regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Go bun√∫sach, buna√≠odh an choiste forbartha um cl√°racha Ghaeilge i gcomhair le Foras na Gaeilge i 1999.  T√° s√© mar aidhm ag an gcoiste an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus a chuir chun cinn ar na me√°in neamhspleach√° sa t√≠r.  Faoi l√°thair, t√° roinnt ruda√≠ difri√∫la a dh√©anamh ag an gcoiste chun an Ghaeilge a chuir chun cinn.  T√° com√≥rtas "R√©alt DJ" ar si√∫l, mar shampla.  D√©anann an choiste urra√≠ocht ar na com√≥rtais a bh√≠onn ag Gl√≥r na nGael.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I will give Mr. Treacy 60 seconds to put across his point because he is a great man for speaking.  He visited my office in Cork recently and told me there was a need for additional provision in the Bill with regard to safeguarding Irish culture, particularly in respect of music.  I give him an opportunity to inform the committee of his concerns.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I was writing an article on this issue for my music magazine called Backstage Traffic and I contacted Aoife Clabby from the BCI to get clarification from Europe as to the definition of Irish music in respect of licences.  I have the information she gave me.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Is it a large amount of information?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	No.  It is taken from a European directive.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	141	All I am interested in are Mr. Treacy's views.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	142	According to the information I received, it contributes to a distinctively Irish contemporary music culture by engaging with lyrical teams that deal with the history of Ireland and the contemporary realities of life in Ireland today.  It relates the stories and experiences of Irish people or contains, reflects or develops an Irish musical form, especially those which are identifiably part of the living tradition, that is, reels, jigs, polkas, etc.Ms Clabby said this was the way in which the BCI gave out licences.  According to Ms Clabby, the BCI asks respective applicant groups for commercial licences to provide a definition of Irish music for their proposed service and cross-references it against the agreed definition to which I previously referred to ensure it complies.  She stated that in the vast majority of cases, each station provides a tighter, more focused definition of Irish music than is permitted by the EU.  It is the radio stations that state what they will play rather than the EU, thereby breaking the EU tradition since the ratification of the directive.  Mr. O'Keeffe might provide some information on how this works.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Mr. Treacy made a submission and we wanted to give him an opportunity to appear before the committee so we thank him for attending.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Could I make an additional point?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Mr. Treacy should remember that I am under a terrible time constraint.  I will hear from Mr. O'Keeffe in a moment.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I am aware of this.  We carried out a considerable amount of work last year to get some figures for the committee.  The Music Makers Association of Ireland carried out a survey last year that revealed that 91.3% of the places surveyed had no Irish music on their background systems.  We surveyed 41 hotels and found that only three of them had Irish music in the background systems.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	147	We must stick to the business of the Bill.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	This is very important for our culture.  We found that out of a total of 17 premises we surveyed in Killarney, three had Irish music.  A total of 14 hotels in Blarney, which is one of the two main tourist areas in Ireland-----
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Blarney is a great spot where I constantly hear Irish music.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	150	We found that two premises had Irish music.  Of 40 businesses surveyed in Cork, none had any Irish music.  Less than one in ten businesses we surveyed had any Irish music.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I thank Mr. Treacy for making his point.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I must turn to Mr. O'Keeffe.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Will the Deputy answer as well?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	156	No, I would not expect the Chairman to do so as it would not be fair to him at this stage of the proceedings.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I ask the Deputy to work with me on the time constraints.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I have received communications from constituents which are along the same line.  It is possibly a matter for another forum or another time.  In general, TG4 is doing a reasonably good job.  There needs to be an evaluation of how Irish folk and traditional music must evolve.  We must move it forward.  In the 1960s, we had Se√°n √ì Riada and various people who promoted the concept and modernised it and gave it a new meaning.  This needs to happen again.  There then needs to be a recognition by the broadcasters that this is part of our tradition, be it as Gaeilge or as B√©arla, and transcends all languages.  This is an important point.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Was Se√°n √ì Riada also from Cork?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	160	There were references to the policy which is supported at EU level and the definition of Irish music.  I could bore the committee with considerable details about this.  The definition we use is operated by all the stations.  The issue is slightly different in that it relates to the nature of the music played.  Clearly, certain pop stations do not play certain types of music and so forth.  Perhaps we might be able to address this through licensing.  We are licensing additional services.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Has Mr. O'Keeffe taken note of what Mr. Treacy said?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Absolutely.  We have been liaising with him.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I have two questions for Mr. √ì Gallch√≥ir.  Does he think it necessary for all members on the audience council for TG4 to be fluent as Gaeilge?  I have a point to make in respect to the electronic programme guide, EPG, for example that of NTL or Chorus.  I am a customer of NTL in Dublin and Chorus in Cork, but I noticed that TG4 is way down the EPG.  BBC comes up first on the EPG, which we will discuss in respect of Channel 6 after lunch.  Has Mr. √ì Gallch√≥ir any views on that and whether the digital operators here under the jurisdiction of the laws of this land should be compelled to ensure that national channels come first on the EPG, in the same way as RTE1 is followed by Network 2, TV3, TG4 and Channel 6?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Public service broadcasters should be a must-carry and TG4 should have a prominent position on the EPG.  This position should be number 4, as it is with the Sky 104 position.  The audience council for TG4 should hold its meetings as Gaeilge and do its work through Irish.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Has Deputy √ì Snodaigh any concluding remarks?

The debate in respect of what constitutes Irish music or culture is ongoing.  There is now an additional responsibility on the Arts Council to promote Irish traditional music and arts.  One of the points raised by Mr. Treacy is that the Arts Council should possibly approach hotels and similar establishments to encourage them to change the music they play in the background.  We should look at trying to ensure that all public service broadcasters have quotas or are encouraged to use more Irish music beyond pop music, such as that played by U2 or the Corrs, in terms of music in the Irish language and to encourage smaller up-and-coming bands who do not get the airplay.  Encouraging the entire range of cultures in Ireland is one of the jobs of public service broadcasting.  A longer debate should be considered as the Bill progresses to underline how this can be reflected in public service broadcasting.

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.  The sitting will resume at 2 p.m. to discuss clarification of the objectives of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and consider the compliance and contracts committees.

A number of people all over the country are watching proceedings on the webcast at www.econsultation.ie.Our final session seeks to clarify the objectives of the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, regarding electronic programme guides, digital media and community radio to accord with the Disability Act 2005.  In the previous sessions, members examined 11 of the 12 issues they selected.  We are on a journey of learning which has brought us to the core of the draft ministerial broadcasting legislative proposals.  We will now discuss heads 7, 24 and 25.  Deputy Durkan will begin the questions.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	171	What level of activity or business of the BAI and its committees will relate to TG4 or Radio na Gaeltachta and what are the criteria laid down in this area?  To what degree will the first and second national languages be catered for in this context?  We must remember we are also discussing the contracts award committee and compliance committee, and any committees or sub-committees of the main body which might be appointed thereafter.Do broadcasters' unions and vocational representatives have in mind any specific or particular visions of what would constitute a good appointee to the board?  What qualifications should appointees have to reflect the interests of their lobby groups?  I do not suggest for one moment the only interests are those represented here.  Appointees will also represent the general public, viewers and listeners.All interested bodies will have ideas on who should be the nominees.  What is the ideal way to identify suitable nominees?  Should it be done in the usual way as envisaged in the legislation or should it be done in another fashion more reflective of the broad community independent of broadcasters, unions, ministerial appointees or associates and the wider broadcasting community?  It is a tall order but if anyone wants further elucidation, I often asked parliamentary questions on such subjects as I believe it is important.  If we are to have an independent commission, that commission should be independent in every sense of the word.  It can be beneficial, negative, helpful or unhelpful depending on the interests of the parties concerned.  It would have a tremendous impact on the efficacy of such a commission.A common executive of RTE, TG4 and other broadcasting groups‚Äî
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	172	We are discussing the appointment of the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  We will then move on to another section, namely, the objectives of the authority.  I do not want to cross over.  We will then move on to the functions of the authority and our last session will be miscellaneous and general.  I will start by asking Mr. Conor Maguire of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, his views and answer some of those questions, followed by Mr. Peter Feeney, Mr. David McMunn, TG4 and the unions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I will take the question on the appointment to the boards first.  My experience on the IRTC and the BCI goes back to 1998 during which time various personnel served on the boards.  I will give the committee a flavour of it by stating that without exception the way in which members discharge their duties is exceptional.  They are extremely careful regardless of the sector of society from which they come.  This is not a pious platitude.  The level of service put in by people should be recorded.  As anybody on a board such as ours knows, controversial decisions are taken from time to time.  One can be blamed for pushing an agenda and doing business in inappropriate ways.  However, in my experience, individual members discharge their duties in an independent way.  It is an educative process to see the work put in by individual members.It is important a cross-section of society is represented on a board such as the BAI.  Certain areas require expertise and knowledge.  However, it would be a mistake to draw the individuals to be appointed from particular segments on a representative basis.  For the board to be run properly, members must take off their representative caps when they enter the room and deal with each issue on an independent and fair-minded basis.It is important to ensure a diversity of views and one should include large interest groups, such as employers, unions or people from a particular sector of society described as business.  A wide view should be available because that is the only way to maintain a balance, which is essential when dealing with broadcasting matters because much of the decision making is subjective.  The people dealing with it have to make up their own minds on the basis of the choice of options open to them.  I do not know if that answers the question.  It is important to ensure a diversity of views and backgrounds on the board.We have a reservation, although it is not overwhelming, on the three structures contemplated - contracts, compliance and the board.  I question the necessity of a separate contracts committee.  That is a throwback to the licensing that was done initially by the IRTC and then by its successor, the BCI, which was largely to deal with competitive radio licences.  As people will know, the spectrum is more or less exhausted and the way we approach our business is different from allocating frequencies which are competed for and result in a competitive licensing process.  I wonder how necessary it is to have a three-board structure and whether the BAI could take on the contracts work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I echo much of what Mr. Maguire said.  I stress the importance of having independent people on those boards not just because of how important it is that they be independent in their judgments, but also because public perception of independence of these bodies is critical.  If an independent-minded person comes with the tag of a political party, there may be a perception of favour to that party.On RTE, it is important to stress that the BCI regulates commercial, not public service, broadcasting.  The proposal is that the new BAI will regulate all broadcasters in Ireland so it is important for RTE that there are people on the boards who have an understanding of the needs and interests of public service broadcasting.  That can come from a range of sources such as people who have worked in public service broadcasting or who come in and out of public service broadcasting but also from the academic world.  I agree with Mr. Maguire and add that we must bear in mind that this new body will regulate, for the first time, both public service and commercial broadcasting.  It needs people who understand the particular differences between the two.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I have a general point on how the board should be appointed.  The Council of Europe, of which Ireland is a member, has a recommendation on the independence and functions of regulatory authorities for the broadcasting sector.  That document dates back to the early years of this century and was originally intended to help the former Soviet states to establish proper, independent regulators.  Although we were never behind the Iron Curtain, it is a good general document.  It states that there should be a broad range of people, which has already been suggested by both the BCI and RTE.  However, given broadcasting's specific nature, there should be experts in areas.  It cannot comprise only people from one particular background or interested amateurs.The document states that there should be people who can "guarantee competition between public service broadcasters and private broadcasters".  That is important in this case because the authority will regulate both public service and private broadcasters, which compete for the same revenue and viewers.  We have made the point in our submission that we need people with competition and general business experience.  We are concerned that, under head 83, any person from a commercial broadcaster cannot be a director of the company that will become RTE but there is no such exclusion on people with connections with RTE being on the authority.  If there are to be former RTE people on the authority, it is critical that people with previous experience of the commercial sector should also be represented.  My personal view is that there should be people from neither, just people with general experience.  That is our main observation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Despite the language I am using, Irish is the working language of TG4 and we expect to continue to be regulated in that language.  All contacts we have with RTE and the BCI are bilingual.  Bearing in mind that the function of this new authority would be to regulate the entire sector and our part of it, it is a natural expectation that those appointed to undertake that task would be competent to judge and evaluate the content we air.  Bearing in mind that we will be expected to pay a levy to fund this new authority, being regulated and communicated with by it in our working language, which is an official language of both this State and the EU, is the least we expect.As a new State entity, I presume this authority would be amenable to the workings of the Act and An Coimisin√©ir Teanga.  I will not answer Deputy Durkan's question on which Solomon-like persons have all the qualifications mentioned by the earlier speakers as well as being bilingual.  It will be a challenge to find such persons but Ireland has always provided patriots.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Does Mr. Dooley think a representative of the unions should be on this authority?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	179	In answer to Deputy Durkan, who looked for a prototype, it is a committee.  One cannot look at one individual but a wide group that reflects Irish society in all its diversity and that should include nominees of the trade union movement and industry through the social partnership model.  We dealt with criteria for membership in our submission under head 8.  Head 8 lists a number of qualities but I contend that experience in arts and music should be included.  It also refers to what Mr. √ì Ciardha has just spoken about, Gaeltacht affairs.  This might reflect a view of Cabinet or an individual Minister.  Gaeltacht does not equate to the Irish language and we are concerned that the phrase "Irish language" rather than "Gaeltacht" be used.  That is important for TG4.There should be union representation.  There is no formal union representation on the IRTC and that is a loss.  The references to exclusions in head 11 are extraordinary.  It excludes "a person who holds employment or an interest in a broadcasting undertaking, including, but not limited to Radio Teilif√≠s √âireann and Telif√≠s na Gaeilge, an undertaking holding a contract to broadcast" and "a person who holds employment or an interest in an undertaking which publishes a newspaper".  That excludes a large section of the community that would have a valuable input.  There is a good history in this country of people with a trade union, business or political background who accept positions on State boards leaving their political affiliation or trade union affiliation outside the door.  I make a distinction between something which is representative of the trade union movement and the workforce and something which is reflective of their interests.  All one has to do is reflect on the sacking of the RTE Authority, comprising members who subsequently became Members of the Oireachtas and represented Fianna F√°il on urban councils, by the Minister of the day for the stand they took.  A lot of humbug is spoken about the notion that an affiliation with a political party or other group somehow diminishes one's ability to take an independent stand in the exercise of one's duties following the acceptance of a State appointment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The trade union group representing workers within RTE considers it essential that people with experience on the ground of programming and direct involvement in broadcasting across the board - not just with RTE - should be eligible and that places should be made available for such people.  We would need to discuss whether the process should involve election but it should be done because any authority lacking such experience at board level will not function efficiently.  I wish I had said this morning that I hold the same view on the new board which would run RTE directly under the authority of the BAI.  The Worker Participation Acts should apply equally to that board as they do to Bord na M√≥na, ESB, etc.  It is essential that those who have experience on the ground be reflected at board level in both the BAI and RTE.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The independent radio sector welcomes, in principle, the establishment of the BAI.  We want the membership of the new authority to have extensive broadcasting experience as it is vital that the individuals involved understand the day-to-day workings of the broadcasting sector.  We are also looking for knowledge of and expertise in indigenous competitive environments and for no previous members of the RTE Authority to be considered.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	191	People with a disability, particularly a sensory one, have a right to a place on a board.  It has already been suggested there be a fair cross-section of society on the board and that members should have expertise and a diversity of views.  Given that provision for people with a sensory disability is now an established part of broadcasting legislation and that broadcasting is such a vital part of the lives of people with hearing loss, it would be fair and legitimate to have representation on the board.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I question why previous members of the RTE Authority should be excluded from these new boards.  Mr. McGrath may confirm that a current member of the BCI board is a former member of the RTE Authority and has served on both boards with considerable distinction.  I do not think former members of the RTE Authority should be excluded from the boards, any more than should members of the BCI.  It seems an unfair suggestion.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I have a number of short questions.  Reading the head, it struck me that we already follow a pluralist path.  Section 1(c) of the objectives, relating to the provision of open and pluralistic broadcasting services, comes from Polish legislation and a number of others come from Australian broadcasting legislation, which is quite interesting and highlights the fact that the issues with which we are dealing are universal, as well as crucial.The trade union group of RTE puts a pertinent question in its electronic submission.  It asks how section 2(b) might be achieved.  The objective in section 2(b) is to promote diversity in control of the more influential commercial and community broadcasting services.  We are setting out an objective for the important issue of preventing private monopoly control as exists in our print media.  I interpret the submission as stating that nothing in legislation supports that objective with the powers to achieve it.  I would be interested to hear Ms Curtin's comments on that.Another short question concerns the proposal in section 3(b) that the measures taken by the authority be applied across the range of broadcasting services according to the degree of influence that the different types of broadcasting services are able to exert in shaping community views in Ireland.  The real question is how to define some of the objectives and the submission is a valid request for clarification of some of the fundamental principles.  Can Ms Curtin outline her concerns in more detail and her suggestions for strengthening or clarifying the objectives, particularly in terms of ownership?A fundamental question relating to the RTE Authority is whether it is now ad idem on the need for a single regulatory authority.  Has it been accepted as a necessity and are we all going in the same direction?  If the trade union group still has objections, what are they?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Section 2(b) proposes that the authority promote diversity in control of the more influential commercial and community broadcasting services.  We all saw what happened after the first round of licences, and in the second stage when they were distributed.  The consolidation that has taken place and the money that was made from the licences provide a challenge for the objective of genuinely local and Irish-controlled radio in the commercial sector.  I was puzzled and concerned by the fact that the proposal asks the authority to promote diversity but does not give it any power to enforce it.  I asked the question as to how it would be enforced because I wanted the opinions of the previous members of the BCI, which is why this hearing is very useful.  We would hope and expect to put something on the webcast at a later stage but first I wanted to hear how others present today would promote diversity effectively, given that it has not been done very effectively in the past.Deputy Eamon Ryan's second point related to our request for clarification, which is what we seek.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	202	With regard to Deputy Eamon Ryan's question, RTE welcomed in general terms the notion of a new and modern regulator.  As Mr. Feeney indicated earlier, there are two factors, the first being the essential independence of all the members of whatever committees or boards are contained within the regulator.  The second factor is that the new regulator must be professional and properly resourced in going about its business.Taking the British case, there were a number of regulators in the media and communications sector four or five years ago.  These have been brought together into one regulator called Ofcom, essentially removing all the old structures and applying new ones which have worked very well.  It is internationally regarded as a good regulator both because of the structures applying and the personnel involved.  That is RTE's position on the point.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There is no fundamental objection to the structure being proposed then?  RTE is more concerned that the members be independent.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It is not entirely clear from the scheme how it is all going to work in practice.  The critical issues are independence and professionalism.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	205	There is no fundamental flaw, from the perspective of the witness, in the broad objectives and structure outline.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Not with the regulator per se.  It is important that Ireland should have a modern regulator for this particular area.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	207	That regulator would replace the existing RTE authority and take on many of the functions for both public and independent broadcasters under the one office.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The reality is there is little regulation, in a sense, at present.  The BCI has come into that role in recent years, particularly since the 2001 Act, and prior to that it was in effect a licensing body.  The RTE Authority, in legal terms under the current legislation, acts effectively as the board of RTE.  What is required is a regulator and we would almost be starting from scratch in that respect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I wish to make a brief comment.  RTE would be concerned that the independence of public service broadcasting is not damaged in any way by any new regulatory structure.  Our current structure, with an RTE Authority, has given us 50 years of very good independent public service broadcasting, and our concern is to maintain that.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Has Mr. Feeney reason to believe it might be compromised?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	211	It is in a sense as much to do with perception as much as reality and we will not know completely until the new structures are in place.  As it stands, with one regulator controlling the whole broadcasting sector, RTE would be concerned that there could be a perceived loss of the independence we have enjoyed up to now.  In addition, the regulator could decide in favour of commercial broadcasting over public service broadcasting or could become more involved in day to day editorial matters than has been the case with the RTE Authority up to now.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	There is nothing in the objectives as set out in head 24 that would necessarily lead to raising any concerns in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	213	No.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	214	There is no such wording.  It is interesting and there is a general recognition that the introduction of independent broadcasting has been beneficial for the State broadcaster in this country.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	215	We agree.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Broadcasting is far and away better now than it was 20 years ago, and better again with the use of independent production companies by RTE.  There is balancing act for any regulator in terms of ensuring a continuation of the public broadcasting ethos and at the same time not creating a disadvantage for commercial operators as a result of RTE receiving the licence fee and advertising.  The objectives set out the broad parameters of that balancing act.  Fundamentally, there is nothing in the wording that would contradict RTE's aspirations.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	217	There is not.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	218	We will take a comment from Mr. Dooley.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The first problem I have is one of terminology.  There is a loose phrase of "more influential commercial and community broadcasting services".  What is meant by "more influential"?  If this is considered on a national level, one may be speaking about the national broadcaster, but in a community the commercial broadcaster may be the more successful and better staffed commercial radio station.In terms of promoting diversity of control, as a former journalist I bear the scars of having reported on the initial hearings in the midlands and the west where bishops and community activists were wheeled out as proof that the applicants were genuinely representative of the community.  The bishops and community activists were disbanded fairly quickly and many people made money on the licences.There is now a situation where there is cross-ownership between newspapers and there are groups such as Independent & Media, Thomas Crosbie Holdings and other large mergers.  There is an issue in terms of looking at licensing in promoting genuine diversity.  The Bill mentions this as an objective but it would be a real challenge to see how the authority would address the area of promoting diversity.I will also mention what is a glaring absence relating to the objective.  There is no reference to the promotion of quality employment or training.  An absence of any reference to development and training is a crucial flaw within the objectives.  It is referred to under functions but it must be included under the objectives.  The absence of training is reflected in a number of other areas within broadcasting, particularly the commercial sector, where there is for example a very high turnover.  A clear function, relating to competitiveness, must be a commitment to training.Considering the objectives, the National Union of Journalists and I would be very anxious that this would form part of the developmental role of the authority very much along the lines of what has evolved under the work of the BCI in the independent radio sector.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I will take comments from representatives from TV3 and the IBI before asking Mr. Maguire to speak on the discussion so far.  I will also allow Mr. McLoughlin of SPI to contribute.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned diversity of ownership, and two points can be made.  At present, the BCI ensures that its contractors, heavily regulated by annual review meetings, etc., are kept in touch with objectives.  In the case of radio stations this would mean programming would be representative of what the people require.  This should be borne in mind as I note that Mr. Feeney and Mr. Kennedy stated that until the 2001 Act, there was not much regulation.  There has been much regulation of the independent sector.With regard to the domination of a commercial activity here, the reality is there is already one enormous dominant broadcaster, RTE.  It is commercially dominant, especially in the television sector.  It receives the licence fee, which is greater than the entire amount of money in the television advertising market, in which it also holds a majority share.  By any standard definition of competition principle, the company is a dominant player.When Mark Thompson was with the BBC he made the point that such an organisation is an 800-pound gorilla in the jungle that forms a particular market.  At least three or four of those would be required to ensure appropriate services for all people in the area.  Certain groups within the radio sector have a number of licences.  In speaking about commercial dominance, there is currently only one dominant player and this fact should be recognised.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	222	A couple of phrases are being used this afternoon which gall me somewhat.  They include the separation of public service broadcasting and commercial broadcasting.  Essentially, everyone is a broadcaster broadcasting in the public interest.  We do not wake up in the morning not to have the public listening to us; rather we are trying to get the public to listen to us.  One of the definitions we never managed to get to the bottom of yesterday is that we are all public service broadcasters because we are here to serve the public.  Otherwise we would not exist - this is particularly so with commercial radio - because of a lack of listenership.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Is there not a difference?  A station such as Lyric FM can exist in public sector broadcasting because there is a recognition from the State that even though it might not be commercially viable because there is not a large listenership, it deserves to exist.  That is the difference.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	224	That is a product of the way we exist today.  That station would otherwise be termed a niche broadcaster.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I am not arguing that there is no need for it, but our members believe we are providing a public service on a daily basis.  If one were to examine audience figures for local radio stations throughout the country one would find very few stations that were not the most listened to operators their areas.  This proves they are in tune with the people they serve.

This goes to the root of the debate on whether we should have the type of structure proposed in this Bill or the British type structure which would see a dedicated regulator for public service broadcasting.  The UK does not have the equivalent of the organisation represented by Mr. Maguire, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and it does not have the equivalent of ComReg; it has a single communications regulator for the commercial sector.  Does Mr. Tighe feel a commercial classical music radio station or a commercial 24 hour news channel could emerge, because this has not happened so far?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I suppose there is Newstalk 106.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I was referring to a 24 hour news channel, which would be very expensive.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	230	If one was trying to operate a commercial entity one would have to consider this matter and I cannot answer such questions today.  One hopes such developments might become possible as the industry develops and public tastes change and I cannot see why it would not be possible.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Could a commercial station operate as Gaeilge on a pay-per-view basis in the future?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The possibilities are endless and it is ultimately a matter of whether the requisite number of listeners will tune in to make an operation commercially viable and successful.  I do not have the answer to the Deputy's question.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Is Mr. Tighe suggesting we should not have a public service broadcaster?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Not at all, I am suggesting that our members feel they are providing a public service.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Does Mr. Tighe see the importance of the Irish public service broadcaster in terms of our heritage and culture and the importance of protecting it from overseas channels beamed into the country and overseas businesses running commercial interests here?  Does Mr. Tighe see the importance of public channels that are owned by the Irish public?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I think the Irish public service broadcaster is absolutely essential.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Could I add an addendum to the Chairman's question?  Reference was made to the 800 pound gorilla but it was said yesterday that commercial radio is increasingly successful, with audience fragmentation and local stations occupying the number one position in their regions.  If it is not broken, why fix it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The fragmentation of audience is not the only reason local and commercial radio is successful.  Such stations are successful because they are closer to the people they serve on a daily basis and more in tune with local tastes, trends and needs and the shifting preferences of local audiences.  I am not suggesting that RTE should be disbanded as it is doing an extremely good job.  I am suggesting that the new format should ensure a more even playing field than currently exists.  Our members believe they fulfil a valuable public service in broadcasting on a daily basis and this is backed up by listenership figures.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Speakers yesterday suggested we should define public service broadcasting; does Mr. Tighe feel this is necessary?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Absolutely.  The group of industry experts present yesterday could not do so, but formulating a definition could be a starting point that would allow us to work out who we are and what we are doing.On Mr. Dooley's point on training, I am proud to say that the independent sector works closely with the BCI in the Learning Waves industry-led training programme which has proved a very successful operation which our membership is committed to supporting.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	We will take a brief comment from Mr. McLaughlin and then move on to Mr. Maguire before coming back to Deputy Durkan who, I am sure, has a number of points to raise.  I thank Deputy Broughan for attending the meeting as I know he was tied up this morning, he is very welcome as are his invaluable contributions.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	242	As the Chairman knows, all politics is local.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I hope everybody in Cork is tuning in because I will be in trouble otherwise.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I will address a number of points raised in the submission, particularly regarding the objectives and functions of the proposed new authority.In section 24 we are concerned by the omission of a reference to independent producers and the independent production sector.  The importance of the independent production sector was made clear in this morning's discussion given that approximately 24% of all indigenous Irish programming is produced by that sector.  To achieve the objectives of stimulating high quality, diverse and innovative programming, a reference to the independent production sector should be included in section 24.  The independent production sector has proved that it provides creativity, diversity and economic competitiveness, not only to the Irish broadcasting sector but, most crucially, to the licence fee-paying public.We feel section 24 should be beefed up in terms of the regulatory framework proposed given that, as mentioned by many speakers, we are in a market dominated by a single player.  We see regulation as the key to levelling the playing field and we feel that the regulatory language in that section should be strengthened.In section 25, we are concerned by the frequent use of the word "guidance" with regard to the broadcasting authority and its relationship with broadcasters, particularly the public service broadcaster.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	245	We have not reached this point in the discussion yet.  We are talking about the objectives of the authority and we will come back to the areas mentioned in the next session when they will be dealt with by Deputy Fiona O'Malley.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	That is fine.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Can we have Mr. Maguire's learned comments on the debate so far?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I will pick up on the way this matter was introduced in the first instance by specific reference to head 24.2(b) on the promotion of diversity and control of the more influential commercial and community broadcasting services.  It is important to point out that, as far as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is concerned, there is a sophisticated ownership and control policy that was developed on the basis of consultations with all stakeholders.  This is what has applied, it is accessible to the public and it was revised last year on a consultative basis.  This is an area we watch with great care, but not on a case by case basis; it is done in accordance with the policy set out in the policy document.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	249	How many takeovers or mergers has the BCI stopped?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	250	If the Deputy examines the document he will see there are various thresholds regarding the number of stations, control of that number, cross-ownership and the concentration of ownership.  We monitor these matters either on the basis of the numbers concerned or the percentage of control that is concerned and we take a view in that regard.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Has the BCI ever stopped a merger or takeover, for example the merger of a local newspaper group and a local broadcasting group?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	252	We do not have jurisdiction over newspapers; we consider matters from a broadcasting perspective and it becomes a broadcasting issue if there is a question of a broadcaster being taken over.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Is there a single example of the BCI stopping a merger or takeover?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	254	We have not stopped any particular mergers or takeovers.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	255	What is the point of having guidelines?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	256	There is a culture of compliance; the guidelines are enforced and abided by.  The guidelines have not been implemented in the manner suggested by the Deputy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Is it not the case that in the Dublin commercial scene there are at least two broadcasters sharing the same person as the driving commercial interest?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I think the Deputy is suggesting that there are names associated with certain broadcasters common to more than one station.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I do not mean stations but the owners.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	260	‚ÄîI do not want to get into individual cases.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	261	Please allow Mr. Maguire to continue without interruption Deputy Broughan.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The way we judge that is to determine whether the requirements in respect of ownership or control have been breached in a particular instance.  They have not been.  It becomes particularly relevant when dealing with new applications or applications for new services.  These are carefully watched.  While I know this does not fall within this committee's jurisdiction, the Competition Authority also has a role with regard to the concentration of ownership and control.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It seems clear that the proposed Bill needs amending so that any such authority would have to take into account ownership of other media.  Deputy Broughan is making a valid point.  There could be circumstances where the radio stations and newspapers are owned by the same company in an area.  If the legislative power does not currently exist to take this into account I sincerely hope new legislation will.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The ownership and control policy deals with the question of cross-ownership.  However, this is against a background where my organisation does not have anything to do with newspapers per se.I take some comfort from Deputy Eamon Ryan's observation that the broadcasting scene is now better than in the past, particularly with regard to the diversity of choice that now exists.  Ensuring a diversity of choice is most important from any regulatory or licensing body's perspective.  If one was to take a guiding principle behind our licensing policy, it is to ensure that such diversity of choice exists.Members referred to training and development.  We are very conscious of our responsibilities regarding the provision of training and development.  Those attending this meeting who know the radio scene would acknowledge the effort, time and energy that go into the organisation of various support groups for training and development for the industry.  We have a well-recognised training and development policy which has been successful.  We would have no difficulty having this recognised within the legislation.There is slight confusion in respect of public service broadcasting.  It is undoubtedly the case that, for example, a county service fulfils a public service remit in its broadcasting.  One need only listen to a county station to understand that it provides an important means of providing information to the public.  These stations are not public service broadcasting stations, but there are elements of them which fulfil the public service remit and it is fair to recognise this.  That is not to take away the importance of there being a national public service broadcaster.  The BCI is very conscious of this and our relationship with the public service broadcaster.  We were conscious of it when developing the codes, as we were charged to do under the 2001 Act.  It is important to acknowledge that RTE has been helpful and co-operative in the development of those codes to the satisfaction of both parties.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I take the point made by RTE that the BCI has primarily dealt with contracting, regulation and the implementation of codes.  One of the objectives set out for the new authority is to stimulate the provision of high quality, diverse, and innovative programming by commercial, community and public service broadcasters.  I am sure Mr. Maguire will agree that the definition of this is not necessarily always the listenership or viewership - on that basis the hanging of Saddam Hussein would be deemed good programming even though it clearly was not.  How does Mr. Maguire see a newly established authority fulfilling this objective?  How would it measure its achievement of stimulating such programming?  It is not a code or contracting issue; it is a subjective measure of what is or is not good quality.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	266	That is a difficult question to answer.  However, if one were to look at this historically, ranging from the 1998 to 2001 Acts, objectives such as those set out are matters taken into account by bodies such as the BCI.  The very fact that the regulator should gear itself towards stimulating high quality, diverse and innovative programming by commercial, community and public service broadcasters is an important matter of itself.  It is difficult to answer how this is sub-defined, or how the authority would be directed to go further along this route.  The last thing one would want to do is to get into over-provision of specific types of broadcasting or programming in statutory terms.  This is a general objective which is appropriately in place.  I do not know that I can be of much assistance in describing how it can be developed further.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	267	We have now reached the point where we are discussing the most fundamental aspect of broadcasting in the future, namely, the definition of public service broadcasting, how the public sector could compete with the independent sector and vice versa.  How funding and administration should be dealt with is another important issue.Mr. Maguire has touched on a number of issues, such as the nature of a public service obligation and at what level it kicks in.  For example, it could be said that the national public broadcaster has an obligation to provide a public service at local level.  Whether that means the development of regional television transmissions - as happens in larger jurisdictions - and whether these would be economically feasible remains to be seen.  There is also the question of how funding can be made available to local public service providers and from whence the funding might come.Whatever else happens, I am convinced there must be healthy competition in this area as in other areas.  While each has its own area of competence, those providing a public service should not be afraid to compete with the independent sector, nor vice versa.  Whether the public service broadcaster intends to deliver a local focus in the future to the extent the independent sector has done remains to be seen.  I do not know if it is possible, but the Chairman will be aware of the local arrangements in Cork.  RTE Cork and the various independent stations in Munster provide a good service.  I am sure the Chairman has used all of those stations, to varying degrees, from time to time.The critical issue is how the various broadcasters see themselves developing and meeting a public service broadcasting requirement while retaining the local components referred to by previous speakers.  We do not want local radio becoming international radio where we only have radio replicated, controlled and funded from outside the State.  As is the case with Aer Lingus, An Post and various other State services, the public sector, to give the public a better quality and standard of service, must be prepared to compete, and we hope on a level playing pitch.There were several references to regulators.  Regulators and I have had a tempestuous relationship over the years.  I am not certain that the regulatory system, as it applies in Europe, works well or effectively.  It has not been tailored to suit the Irish situation.  I will not delay today's meeting by discussing the various nuances involved but I can quote chapter and verse with regard to where it does not cater for us.  The wisdom of regulators will be observed carefully in future.  The regulatory system may well have to be altered to make it work effectively here.

I will wrap up this discussion with the last question on the EPG.  Did you make a statement or ask a question, Deputy Durkan?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	271	It was a provocative argument.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Was it a statement or a question?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	274	RTE was earlier described as an 800lb gorilla.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	275	No reference to the Chairman now.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I understand gorillas are passive unless attacked.  Deputy Durkan speaks about competition.  Please bear in mind how extraordinarily competitive the Irish television and radio markets are.  There are more than 50 radio stations broadcasting in this market so it is extraordinarily competitive.  In television, the danger is that the strength of non-Irish television stations like the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and so forth is such that unless there is a strong Irish television market we will lose audience share.  If that happens, all of us will suffer nationally.It is critical that there is strong Irish television so we can address Irish audiences, with Irish participants dealing with Irish issues.  Public service television is essential for that.  We can deliver the largest proportion of Irish made programmes.  There will not be "Prime Time", the "News at One", "Morning Ireland" and the like unless there is a well funded public service broadcaster which is as independent as possible of the Government.  For the past 40 years the RTE authority has served us well in that respect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I was asked a specific question by Deputy Eamon Ryan about trying to promote excellence, high quality and so forth.  It is important to note that the way the BCI goes about that work at present is by securing programme commitments from the broadcaster.  The commitments would cover a range of areas but would also deal with the nature of the programmes to be broadcast.  Broadcasters are held to those commitments.  On a separate basis, there is also the programme fund, which can be allocated on the basis of the promotion of excellence.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Deputy Broughan had a question.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I acknowledge there is public service broadcasting in the commercial sector.  I am aware of the work done by Newstalk, Today FM and local stations.  The committee commenced yesterday with a session about convergence, that is, the convergence of delivery systems and the convergence of communications.  Is there not a very strong case, therefore, for merging the BCI and ComReg?  The committee has had grave concerns about the performance of ComReg.  Is there not a prima facie case for merging all that territory under a single regulator on the British model, given that the medium is the message - to use an old phrase?  Perhaps that is the way we should proceed.  Given the often fragile background in many countries of protecting the public service broadcaster per se, it should have its own regulator.  That is my position and if I am in the next D√°il as I hope, that is the position for which I will vote.  I will not vote for the BAI.  If one reads the history of RTE, for the first 20 or 30 years it was apparently √âamon de Valera‚Äôs friend, with them singing to each other each night.  It was behind the ballgame up to the Gay Byrne era.  I am reading one of those petrol station biographies of Gay Byrne at present.  He had an interesting career.  It is interesting how the station and the man who epitomised its public service broadcasting developed over the years.  That said, there is still a powerful case for having a commercial regulator with enhanced powers for the physical side of the new telecommunications.Mr. Maguire said, with regard to the history of the BCI, that it has not stopped anybody getting serious control in the commercial sector.  On that basis, if it is not broken, why fix it?  Why not enhance it?  I have said previously to RTE that there is no reason for not having a parliament channel and a 24 hour news channel and for not developing the public service.  However, looking at the feeble objectives of these headings, I am not sure the case has been made for putting a developed version of BCI in charge of the entire broadcasting system here.  I have not bought that argument.I have another question with regard to accessibility for people with disability and the objectives under the headings.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	280	We will let Mr. Maguire reply first and then come back to that question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	281	We have expressed various reservations about this scheme but they are minor in the overall context.  As far as we are concerned, we consider the proposed scheme appropriate.  We differ from the Deputy's approach in that regard.  Why is that?  The way broadcast media have developed here in the past 20 years could be an international example of the way to develop the radio environment and broadcast media in general.  There are down sides but, by and large, it is a much improved scene.  It came about on the basis of thoughtfully examining the issue of regulation.  It is appropriate to continue on that basis.  I strongly believe in a single content regulator, as contemplated in this scheme.  I acknowledge that it is entering into an area where there is convergence but the distinctions that remain are better regulated on the basis of the scheme set out in the Bill.The Deputy continues to refer to the question of how many mergers or takeovers we have stopped.  I do not wish to leave that hanging in the air because it assumes there have been situations which we have declined to consider or examine to establish whether they comply with our policy.  We continue to apply the policy and we have not found that to be the position.  There might be an apparent rather than real situation in this regard.  As far as the ownership and control policy is concerned, we developed it carefully, tried to do it on an objective basis and we have applied it on a consistent basis.  It is not a question of not applying the policy in particular circumstances.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Thank you, Mr. Maguire.  You made that point previously.  Mr. McMunn wanted to ask a question but I will take Ms Fitzgerald first.  She had a number of issues to deal with arising from the question posed by Deputy Broughan.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Deputy Broughan's question was whether we were adding to heading No. 2(c).
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Yes.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	285	We would like it to refer explicitly to a function of providing broadcasting services which are accessible to people with disabilities.  Section 53 of the Disability Act amended the Broadcasting Act 2001 to assign certain functions to the BCI concerning access rules.  With this new structure it is important that the disability is explicitly spelled out in the objectives of the authority in subhead 24.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	286	It has grave relevance to what is contained in section 53 of the Disability Act amending the 2001 Act.  It adds an extra measure for people with a disability - the development of the teletext service.  That is new.  It is not included in British legislation but is being introduced here.  We welcome this because the teletext service is vitally important to people with severe, or worse, hearing loss who are excluded from radio services.  They are more reliant on the teletext service than others for news, entertainment and indications of which programmes are accessible to them through the symbols for subtitling, audio description and sign language.  This section has great relevance for us, particularly in the digital age.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank Mr. McKenna.  I will come back to Mr. McMunn but I wish to ask Mr. Donnelly a question.  Should network platforms operating in Ireland be regulated by the BAI, with particular reference to their operation of the EPG, giving prominence to Irish channels within it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The short answer is yes.  We have two specific concerns about the legislation.  Mr. Feeney touched upon them.  The biggest threat to Irish television broadcasting is posed by the lack of control of EPGs in the Republic of Ireland.  We are asking the BCI to implement the provisions of section 16 of the 2001 Act that obliges it to regulate EPGs in the Republic of Ireland, that is, the NTL, Chorus and Sky electronic programming guides in this market.  It has not done so to date.  This represents a huge threat to the Irish television broadcasting industry.The second specific concern about this legislation is that the Minister is being given some prerogative within the legislation to oblige the operators of EPGs to give priority to what he perceives as strategic interests in the Irish broadcasting industry.  We have a peculiar situation in this country whereby Sky operates in this market under an Ofcom licence.  In other words, the British Government controls a significant share of the Irish television market.  Sky has admitted in writing that Ofcom does not regulate it in the Republic of Ireland.  Ofcom leaves it to regulate itself here and in doing so is discriminating against Irish channels in favour of British ones.  We would like this issue to be addressed.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Before I ask Mr. O'Keeffe to comment, we heard the views of TG4 this morning.  We have also heard the views of TV3 and RTE on this issue.  Mr. Donnelly is aware of the fact that, on behalf of the joint committee, I travelled to the United Kingdom with the clerk to the committee to meet representatives of Ofcom to raise a number of issues.  We were actually learning about DAB and DTT in order that the committee could prepare for digital audio broadcasting and digital terrestrial television services.  That is important to us, given our communications remit.  Ofcom made it clear to us that it was not, as Mr. Donnelly has so rightly said, able to regulate Sky as regards the EPG for Ireland.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	290	That is right.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I am aware of the EPG for Ireland.  I have not seen Channel 6 on the EPG, although I have searched through 999 channels.  Where is it located on the EPG?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The specifics of this matter are that in the United Kingdom Ofcom dictates that terrestrial channels such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are to be given priority.  In other words, they rank first, second, third and fourth on the EPG.  The reason for this is to given them a good advantage over other channels.  The critical aspect is that the higher up one is on the EPG, the more significant one's audience will be.  In the Irish Republic it has arbitrarily chosen to put RTE 1, TV3 and so on at the top.  It has chosen to put us at the bottom, behind all the British channels.  It has put RTE at the top, at its own discretion.  The significance of this is that it can choose at its own discretion to take RTE, TV3 or TG4 off it.  We have received the best legal advice in Britain and Ireland to say it has full authority to do so by virtue of the fact that the BCI has not licensed it.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I see.  Before we go to Mr. O'Keeffe, I want to clarify something.  On the EPG for Sky RTE One is on channel 101 and RTE 2, channel 102.  Is that correct?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	296	That is my understanding, yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	297	TG4 is on channel 104 and Sky One, 106.  There is no channel 105.  Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	298	There is no channel 105 because in this market there is no Channel 5.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I see.  Sky Two is on channel 107; Sky 3, 108; UKTV Gold, 109; UKTV Gold Plus One, 110, and UKTV G2, 111.  Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Correct.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	305	We will go back to NTL to which Mr. Donnelly's submission also relates.  Am I right in saying the EPG listing for digital broadcasters here is that RTE 1 is on channel 101; RTE 2, 102; TV3, 103; TG4, 104; Setanta Sports, 105; Channel 6, 106, and City Channel, 107.  Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Correct.  We have no difficulty with what NTL and Chorus do on the basis that they are acting positively towards Irish channels, but Sky is not.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I understand that.  I just want to record what has happened.  I wish to ask Mr. O'Keeffe if we are correctly interpreting the law relating to EPG as passed by the Oireachtas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I will outline the background as briefly as I can.  The matter was raised with us by Channel 6 a number of months ago.  We made contact with Ofcom to clarify what the licence position was.  Sky has always maintained that its EPG in Ireland is co vered by the UK licence it receives from Ofcom.  We wrote to Ofcom to seek clarification.  It has clarified that it has given a licence for an EPG to Sky.  In its view it covers the EPG Sky operates in the Republic of Ireland.  We also raised with it the fact that it had given a placement to Irish channels in Ireland but not in the United Kingdom.  It stated that, as far as it was concerned, this was in accordance with the spirit of the UK Communications Act.  That is the position.  Both Ofcom and Sky state the EPG is licensed in the United Kingdom; that the United Kingdom has jurisdiction to give that licence and that it is not a matter for us.In the recent past we had an informal discussion with representatives of Channel 6 on that basis.  Channel 6 has recently submitted a legal opinion to us, to which Mr. Donnelly referred, which implies that the matter of jurisdiction concerning EPGs is not clear cut.  The argument is that jurisdiction applies only to programme material rather than the electronic programme guide.  In light of receiving that, and the information therein, we have now referred that material to our own legal advisers because it raises a number of issues which potentially might be beneficial towards Channel 6.  Up to receiving it, our position was that there was nothing we could do to force Sky to change the EPG in Ireland.  There may be something in that.  Our current position is that the matter is with our legal advisers, we will be reporting back to our board and we will be proceeding with that.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Is Setanta Sports covered on the Sky EPG?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	310	This particular matter is not an issue for Setanta Sports.  That channel is carried within the sports group on Sky.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Can the committee take it that at present this issue is being handled by BCI with Sky?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Yes, with Ofcom and, obviously, with Channel 6.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I think it is the wish of this committee that Sky would do everything in its power to accommodate another channel, which is operating in and originating from this country.  Would I be correct in saying so?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	314	On the legislation we can draft and pass, we must obviously deal with the European Union on the television without frontiers directive.  How, in domestic legislation, can we ensure that a local channel is facilitated?  Can that be done in this legislation?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I do not have the answer to that question.  I asked whether it should be and Deputy Broughan is asking the same question.  It is the will and wish of this committee that this would be included in the legislation if it is at all possible and that will depend on the legal advice the Department receives on the matter.  It is a serious issue and as far as the committee is concerned, Sky should accommodate this channel the same as it is accommodates the other commercial and national channels.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	316	There is one more point on that.  What is the position of Channel 6 where a person has a dish but is not subscribing to Sky?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	317	If the person is not a subscriber, presumably he or she has an English card.  If the person is not subscribing, I am sure he or she should not be accessing it.I should stress that this is a threat, not just to us but to RTE, TV3 and TG4.  If Sky has been given discretion to do what it wishes in this market, which Ofcom has openly admitted it has given, then Sky could exercise that discretion in its own favour tomorrow, if it suited commercially, by dropping RTE, TV3 down the EPG.  It will not just affect us.  It will affect other channels.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I hope Mr. Donnelly does not end up in the channels we will not let many people view.I have been thinking about public service broadcasting.  I am wondering whether we should define public service broadcasting by what it is not rather than by what it is?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Or by what it is supposed to be.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Perhaps the officials from the Department might consider that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	321	There is a good definition of public service broadcasting within the Bill, which states that Radio Teilif√≠s √âireann shall ensure programme schedules and broadcast services referred to provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the English and Irish languages that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland, including both on television and radio, and that entertain, inform, educate, provide coverage of sporting, religious and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests, in which case respect human dignity.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I thank Mr. Feeney.  We will now discuss the functions of the authority.  We will take the miscellaneous and general together.  With 38 minutes to finish, I think there is enough time.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	323	In the first instance, I agree with what Mr. Tighe stated earlier that it is unfortunate to put public broadcasting service up against commercial service.  As time went on, he got a little more sympathy for the notion that the commercial sector provides a public service and I think that needs to be acknowledged.Head 25(2)(e) mentions a requirement that the authority would have to co-operate with other bodies to promote training activities in areas of skill shortages.  It was slightly unfair of Mr. Dooley to state that the issues of skills were not being addressed within the Bill, and he seems to wish to respond.Some of the additional functions that the authority may have, particularly to collect and disseminate information on the broadcasting sector in Ireland and to deal with matters internationally, would place a significant burden, financial or administrative, on the authority, and particularly on disability issues.  Does the authority see that it will have the capacity to ensure that the authority is in compliance with section 53 of the Disabilities Act?  Would such function be seen as a major area of work for the authority?  A member of the public made an observation about how to solicit audience feedback and whether this should be done before licences are granted, and I would be interested in witnesses' comments in that regard.Is it also envisaged that the broadcasting authority would request the public service broadcasters to provide free-to-air services for communities beyond Ireland?  I am interested in this international dimension because we have limited capacity.  In that sense, television and broadcasting goes beyond the international boundaries.  Earlier, we came up against the issue of jurisdiction in a question raised.  How can we overcome the problem of limited jurisdiction or what kind of pan-European authority does the panel imagine would be provided for?I agree with Mr. McLaughlin on the question of guidance.  Comments were made earlier, particularly by Deputy Broughan, about how timid is much of the draft legislation.  I am inclined to think that this might be because the purpose of today's eConsultation process is to make it more robust.  I was interested in the question of guidance as opposed to directives which Mr. McLaughlin had started to raise.  It would seem fairly useless to insist upon a guidance and I would be interested in his comments on that.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	324	We will start with Mr. McLaughlin and then get feedback on the other questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	325	On Deputy Fiona O'Malley's point, our view is that the reference, particularly in head 25(1)(j), to the word ‚Äúguidance‚Äù implies quite a loose regulatory framework.  This also relates to sections 100(8), 103(1), 104(1) and 107(2) where there is reference to the word guidance.  We would suggest to the committee that the word which should be used is ‚Äúdirections‚Äù.  Given that the objective of the Minister is obviously to establish a single content regulator and that the idea is to encompass the existing regulatory powers of the BCI, the BCC and the RTE Authority, the proposed regulatory powers for the BAI are less weak than those currently in use by the individual regulators - the BCI, the BCC and the RTE Authority.  The danger therein is that if the BAI only has a guidance role, there would be a weakness in the authority‚Äôs ability to ensure the code of fair trade and practice objectives are properly applied.On the code of fair trade and practice, a function of the authority should be to ensure an obligation on the public service broadcaster to invest in indigenous feature film production as well as to provide a quota of young people's, children's and animation programming.  It is important that it be recognised, particularly in legislation, that feature film production should be supported by the public service broadcaster, as is the case with many such broadcasters in most other European countries and in many countries around the world.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	326	To draw attention to the NUJ submission, I welcomed the reference to training in head 24.  My comments were a reference to head 25.  The objectives are defined differently from the functions, although I do not know why.  Training should be included as an objective as well as a function.  However, the full terminology used is "the promotion of excellence through quality employment and training".I stress the importance of quality employment as well as training against the backdrop of representing members in the independent commercial sector, including in a significant number of areas where we have encountered hostility to the right to trade union representation.  During the discussion on Sky, I was going to flippantly request a minute's silence but decided against it in respect of the demise of Sky News Ireland and the jobs of our members.  I was denied, as a trade union official, the right to represent members whose jobs were being discarded.  It is not enough to enter the market and create jobs.  Quality employment must be provided, which clearly means security of tenure and recognition that people in a sovereign republic cannot be offered contracts that state British law will apply.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	327	With regard to head 25, it is particularly amusing that Deputy Broughan said public service broadcasting or RTE is a fragile entity.  This entity has an income in excess of ‚Ç¨400 million a year and that does not sound fragile to me.  This fact is important because the Deputy stated there was a danger public service broadcasting could be lost.  However, there is no definition for public service broadcasting in this entity.  The public service broadcaster in this State takes advertising and competes fully in the commercial sector with independent radio and television.  Under head 25, I agree with the SPI delegation that the guidance should be stronger.  Head 25(1)(h) refers to the sectoral impact of proposals that RTE may make.  The sectoral impact will need to be much harder hitting than that, which would be in keeping with the Government‚Äôs own requirements on regulation generally.  RTE is not fragile and if the committee wants to ensure diversity and a plurality of services are encouraged and interesting programmes and services are provided, genuine competition must be ensured.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Our observation refers to Mr. Donnelly's previous comment.  A function of the authority should be to direct ComReg to ensure all national services have due prominence and must carry status on all platforms because in an increasingly crowded market with so many platforms competing, the national broadcasting authority must have that function.  I do not wish to dishearten Mr. Donnelly but in the early days of TnaG, we found ourselves on channels 13 and 19 with cable companies carrying only 20 channels.  One of the factors that persuaded us to rebrand the channel as TG4 was to gain possession of the number ceathar, which was persuasive in talking to a number of cable companies.Deputy Fiona O'Malley referred to the importance of servicing our audience, whether it resides on the island.  That is close to the heart of Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge, given our history of emigration.  We, therefore, welcome proposals that would encourage and enable us to provide a service for the diaspora and thousands of others who have no connection with the island but who wish to learn the language or immerse themselves in our culture.  While welcoming the proposals, they are fraught with complex rights issues but, notwithstanding that, all of TG4's output is webcast live worldwide at www.tg4.tv, except programming that is not rights protected.  As with this committee‚Äôs proceedings, the importance of a webcast in delivering services to people resident outside the island will increase rather than decrease.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I refer to Mr. McLoughlin's comment about an obligation on the public service broadcaster to invest in films made for cinematic release.  That is the function of the Irish Film Board.  If RTE becomes obliged to invest in feature films, it will be at the expense of budgets for television programmes.  The pot is limited, not infinite, and if we are forced to spend money on funding films for cinema, it will be at the expense of "Fair City" or another programme.  The pot is not large enough to allow us to invest in films for cinema, which, by and large, lose money in Ireland.  There would not be much return on the investment.  I encourage members not to go down that route.I agree with everything Mr. √ì Ciardha said about an international service for Irish television.  Sufficient material is produced by RTE 1, RTE 2 and TG4 to which they have rights to offer as an attractive service to Irish people living abroad.  The issue is the cost of the delivery of the service and who should pay.  If RTE had to pay for that, it would come out of the same pot for all our programmes and it would mean the loss of existing programming.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Minister published the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill in December 2006 to deal with digital terrestrial television and broadcasting overseas to Irish communities.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	331	With regard to the platforms, it is important that indigenous broadcasters be given priority but I would like indigenous content to be taken into account when that is examined, as that would be relevant.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I thank Deputy Fiona O'Malley for recognising that a public service is provided on a daily basis by our membership.  That is greatly appreciated.  The difficulty with RTE is it is providing a public service in a commercial environment but that is not the company's fault.  That is the one of the difficulties it faces.  RTE has a foot in both camps.While the development of domestic television and films is not strictly within my remit, as a member of the Irish diaspora with family in Ireland and England, that would be welcome.  I would support that.We have a number of issues with the regulatory functions going forward and I am not sure whether this is the correct time to bring them up.  We have not covered the investigating officers and the powers they possess.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	333	We will not discuss them now.  We are running to deadline and I am back in the running for the job as producer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I refer to the issues raised by Deputy Fiona O'Malley.  We requested that research information, training and development and other major areas of work be given a legislative basis and we warmly welcome that.  We have a training and development policy and we are developing a research policy.  The BCI has information on its elaborate website.

I refer to the famous case involving Phantom FM and another station, which was controversial because many people loved the station that was not successful.  How was the research addressed?  Does the BCI want that issue addressed in the legislation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	336	That is a separate issue to research.  I referred to a research policy on major developments in broadcasting both nationally and internationally.  The Phantom FM issue relates to the research conducted for a licence application and how that is verified.  That was the subject of a court case at the time.

We feel this should be an important function of a regulatory body, which has duties under section 53 of the Disabilities Act to ensure that there are access rules and that a certain proportion of programmes are provided for people with disabilities.  It is important that the regulatory body should report on that and on the extent to which those duties are being fulfilled.  I see that as a core function of the remit of the commission and not excessively expensive.

This is important in the political as well as in the broadcasting sphere.  Opposition Members have been particularly sensitive regarding this matter.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	354	That remains to be seen.  You may have the experience sooner than you think, Chairman.  It is a chastening experience for everyone.  When in Opposition, one begins to recognise the need for impartiality.  Yesterday,  you misconstrued what I was saying and my colleague, Deputy Ryan, felt I was introducing politics into this area.  Politics already exists in this area, regardless of whether we like it.  Whenever there is a reference in legislation to ministerial approval, I have always tried to ensure that it is followed by a requirement of Oireachtas approval.  A requirement of ministerial approval ensures that only the Government side of politics is involved.It is of critical importance that we introduce a system which is not only above board but is seen to be above board and absolutely impartial.  We must not allow a situation in which public broadcasters or other stations are accused, often correctly, of broadcasting soft interviews of particular people at particular times.  There is no need for the public broadcasting sector to doff its cap to Government Ministers, who should be treated the same as everyone else.  This is the clear difference between the public broadcasting sector and a sector with a public service obligation.  There is a subtle difference between the two.If we are to improve the situation, we should note the difference between the way the BBC operates and the way we operate.  It is not uncommon in the United Kingdom for a politician, whether a Government Minister or a member of the Opposition, to be rigorously interviewed by the national broadcaster.  This does not necessarily happen in this country.  I am not pointing a finger in any particular direction but concern has been expressed in this regard.I would not like to see the Chairman and his Government colleagues in Opposition‚Äî

There is a tendency for statements from Members of the Opposition to be picked up by independent broadcasters but not by the national broadcaster.  Therein hangs a tale.  This critical factor must be addressed.Ministerial approval can become interference if influence is exercised, either directly or indirectly, in such a way as to bend the broadcasting system in a particular direction.  The provision of an impartial broadcasting service is the best way to serve the public.  If there must be ministerial avowal, there must also be parliamentary approval in order to ensure checks and balances.  This applies in every other sector and should also apply to the broadcasting sector.

In the nine years since I was elected to this House I have never seen a Government Minister being given a soft interview.  I have always seen journalists ask hard questions, fairly and directly.  Perhaps I have been watching the wrong news bulletins.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The Bill will establish a broadcasting regulator.  This committee and the Department it invigilates have experience of regulators.  We established a regulator for the fisheries sector on 1 January.  The advantage of a regulator is that the sector concerned is one step removed from ministerial control.  The existence of a regulator is also beneficial to Governments, and has certainly been so to the Government of the past ten years.  When problems emerge, the Government can absolve itself of responsibility.  In the recent controversy regarding energy costs, for example, the Government insisted that the problem was one for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We hear this claim in almost every area.  In many areas where there is not an independent regulator, the appointment of one is being vaguely considered.The proposed broadcasting Bill will establish three committees as well as the board itself.  The Minister will have enormous power through the appointments system.  The Labour Party always proposes gender equality on State boards.  This was not achieved in the case of the fisheries board.  The Labour Party wishes to include gender equality in all legislation.  My former colleague, Ms Fitzgerald, was instrumental in helping to establish gender equality in the third last parliament.  If the revamped Broadcasting Commission of Ireland had an overarching role in broadcasting, ministerial power would still be very strong.When I referred to the fragile broadcasting environment I was thinking of the time the Taoiseach, Mr. Se√°n Lemass, telephoned the national broadcaster and said he wanted something done a particular way.  I have some sympathy for what my colleague says.  Government people seem to have tremendous access.  For example, the Deputy will not contradict the fact that her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, seems to appear regularly on Pat Kenny's programmes, often several times a week.  People often ask why he and others such as the Taoiseach - who is not formally interviewed that often - are not asked hard policy questions rather than the soft focus human interest questions.  While people are interested in these areas, they are also interested in issues like those covered on the Joe Duffy show this afternoon, such as private and public medicine.  Why do we have this significant gap and why is the hard policy question rarely put to people like the Taoiseach?  Is there a profound ministerial power in this regard and will it continue?  If the Bill goes ahead, will RTE consider it necessary to establish a special division to protect the public broadcasting element?  How can the BAI be strengthened and do we need the possibility of ministerial intervention?  It is often alleged that boards are formed from the large talent bank of whoever is in power and that the acolytes of those in power are ultimately appointed to the boards.

It is important that we get the views of the witnesses about the level of ministerial involvement proposed in the Bill and the dangers involved.  It would be interesting to hear their views.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Why do we not ask the people who made the submission, namely, RTE and the trade union group?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	363	This is a concern shared by the trade union group and the National Union of Journalists.  There is obviously direct influence through the appointment of 78 nominees.  In addition, in the case of RTE, for example, the Minister acts as the sole member of the new RTE company.  In that regard the Minister's membership carries all the rights and obligations that a member of a company would normally have.  This is covered under head 73.  All of the other powers and restrictions flow from this.I will not be able to deal with these powers in the few moments available now.  There is a centralist theme or approach throughout the Bill which would make Stalin blush and which confers powers and influence directly and indirectly on the Minister of the day.  The centralist approach is not reflective of trends within the evolution of broadcasting policy anywhere else and flies in the face of the work of this committee, which aims to be inclusive and recognise that broadcasting is of public importance.In the area of public service broadcasting, it is entirely appropriate that the Minister and Government of the day would have a role in ensuring that public service obligations are met.  So far, there has been a failure to distinguish between broadcasting which is a public service and broadcasting which is a public obligation.  That distinction has been missing in the debate.  The broadcasting of death notices is clearly a public service, but that is not the same as a public service obligation, which is specific.  In that regard a Minister must have influence.  However, the degree of influence envisaged in the Bill is not acceptable.

In terms of the number of boards, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has taken the view that there is no necessity for three boards and that two are sufficient.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Deputy Durkan raised the issue of impartiality.  The law on impartiality will not change under this Bill and there is no specific change with regard to the law and how broadcasters operate.   With regard to interventions and how the legislation works in terms of ministerial activity, we notice that the proposed Bill suggests 50 occasions when either the Minister, the Government or the BAI has a role in the activities of RTE as opposed to 25 occasions under the current legislation.  In terms of change, this legislation represents a more intensive form of bureaucracy or legislation.  Perhaps that is something we should examine and consider whether it is necessary in a country this size.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	370	That is a fair answer.  Does Mr. √ì Ciardha wish to comment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I am consoled as I hope Deputy Durkan will be by what is contained under head 115.  It is stated under that head that if any alteration to the remit of TG4 was to be proposed, the Minister would have to make an order and lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a good provision.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Does Mr. McMunn wish to comment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	373	My comment relates to the make-up of the board.  However the board is appointed, those nominated should be independent of any particular interest.  With regard to the point made by RTE about the 50 references to the Minister or the authority as distinct from 25 under current legislation, given the Bill is being introduced to ensure a fairer playing ground for all parties, it is likely there will be further reference to regulation on RTE.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	374	RTE raised its concern about the regulations and divisions between RTE and the commercial sector.  Its concern was that the national public service broadcaster would not be adequately protected under the Bill.  Does Mr. Feeney wish to expand on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	375	We spoke about that earlier today and said it was important that the composition of the boards would take account of public service interests.

I have learned something from this debate.  Mr. Maguire said earlier that it is hard to regulate for quality, but we all know what it is.  The real task for any future regulator will be subjective.  I have heard nothing over the past few days to indicate the Bill should not go ahead and see no reason it should not be enacted by April or May.  The process started four and a half years ago when I was first elected to the D√°il and at that time we held a consultation process in the RDS on the issue.  Now, over four years later I see no reason we should delay.The process conducted by the committee will have helped the progress of the Bill and has been a good lesson.  The work of the Chairman and the committee officials is commendable and will assist debates on Second and Committee Stages.  It would do a disservice to the new process of legislation if the Minister and the Department did not succeed in getting the legislation passed.  My main criticism is the delay in completing the process.  Uncertainty in any of the relevant organisations, whether for or against, will not help.  I see no reason not to proceed with the Bill at full speed.  I would not tell a broadcaster its job in terms of what question to ask the Minister, but I believe the question to be asked is whether the Bill will be enacted before the end of this Government.  If not, we will have to start the whole process again and produce new heads of the Bill.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	378	We will not get an answer to that.

I commend the Chairman and the groups who made submissions and the process conducted by the committee.  It has been a useful process and should be a model for further legislation.

The process has been useful in teasing out the issues and hearing the views of witnesses.  I hope the witnesses have also found it a fruitful exercise.  The best we can do now is to help the legislation proceed and ensure our work has not been in vain.

The Government's not inconsiderable footprint, already evident, will increase dramatically under this proposal.  I ask the Chairman, a self-respecting member of a political party, how he would feel if he had at his disposal the appointment of 78 people to a board supposed to be impartial thereafter.  Would he feel offended if the people in question acted impartially?  Would he feel they had to follow a particular line?  It speaks for itself.

I thank those who contacted the committee on-line.  We have followed this up in the last few days.  I apologise for not being able to be here this morning.I would like to comment on the structure of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  My preference would be for a regulator like Ofcom in the United Kingdom.  I do not trust some of the structures we have seen in the past.  I am interested in some of the ideas proposed by my colleague sitting beside me.  I would prefer to see the establishment of an independent regulator for the national public service broadcasters.  Fundamentally, I do not agree with the BAI structure proposed.  The new Government will be grateful for what has been done and will build on it.  We will pass the shorter broadcasting Bill which relates to digital services and broadcasting to the Irish diaspora because it is urgently needed.  The Government should reconsider the Bill under discussion at this meeting.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-01-11 00:00:00	Prelude	385	This began with the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt.  The Government asked the committee to help it to decide which Bill would be used for the pilot scheme for e-consultation, as part of the e-parliament process.  The proceedings of the D√°il and Seanad are already being webcast.  This is the first committee to have its meetings webcast.  I hope other committees will do likewise, in order that eventually we will be able to webcast every committee in the Houses, in line with the commitment of the Oireachtas to the e-democracy and e-parliament process.  I pay tribute to the Chief Whip, the Taoiseach and rest of the Government.  I mention the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in particular, because he suggested that this Bill should be used in the pilot scheme.During the various public hearings in the last couple of days the members of the committee have examined the 12 issues selected.  As I said, we have been on a journey of learning about the issues which arose from the draft ministerial broadcasting legislative proposals.  The e-consultation project has been a positive experience.  It is the first time such a project has been pursued anywhere in the world, as far as I am aware.  It is the first time a sovereign national parliament has engaged in such an open and extensive process of consultation with citizens on legislation that will have a significant direct impact on their day-to-day lives.  The draft ministerial broadcasting legislative proposals will lead to the development of a single regulatory environment that will change the structure of RTE, the national public service broadcaster.  It will represent the single biggest change in the broadcasting sector since the inception of RTE.I thank everybody who has participated in this process.  I thank those citizens who visited and registered on the e-consultation website, submitted observations, attended public meetings and followed the proceedings on the Internet in the last two days.  I reiterate that the website has received more than 60,000 hits and 467 submissions have been received.  A significant number of the hits originated from the link on the website of RTE.  I hope everyone will take the opportunity to use the discussion forum on the website which will be available until 24 January.  If any of the representatives who have appeared before the committee in the last two days are asked by the university groups evaluating this process to give feedback, I hope they will assist them in that matter.I join my colleagues on the committee in thanking the staff, including the clerk to the committee and the committee secretariat, who have made substantial back-up facilities available to the committee throughout this process.  This is the 100th meeting of the joint committee since it was put in place in October 2002.  There have also been meetings of the sub-committees dealing with fisheries and broadband services, as well as other committees.  I will not mention the number of hours for which the committee has met because the media will be afraid to write about the matter tomorrow but it is significant that this is the 100th meeting of the committee.I thank the broadcasting unit and the ICT unit for facilitating the webcasting of the committee's proceedings.  The transcript of the proceedings will be accessible via the archive on the Oireachtas website and will be made available to all concerned.  I thank the editorial staff who will edit all the comments and contributions made in the last two days.  I also thank the ushers and the rest of the staff of the Houses who have worked so hard for us since yesterday morning.  I thank the committee's consultant, Ms Sadhbh McCarthy, who is sitting beside me for the excellent work she has done in the last six to eight weeks, including over Christmas, to help the members of the committee to prepare for the work we have done yesterday and today.
