          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2021-07-13T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">Apologies have been received from Deputies Dillon, Hourigan, MacSharry and Munster. I welcome everyone to the meeting. Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room. Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin. I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to that constitutional requirement. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Today we engage with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health. This engagement is a continuation of our meeting in February and we will resume our examination of the board's 2019 financial statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Department of Health: Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary of health infrastructure and Ms Fiona Prendergast, acting director of health infrastructure. All of the witnesses are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback. As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give their evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege. Today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present. Such witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness. If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the board's financial statements in February and it was recirculated to the committee before this meeting. Will the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to address it again?</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I thank Mr. McCarthy. I will now invite Mr. Gunning to make his opening statement. I hope Mr. Gunning will appreciate that, unfortunately, we have limited time due to the restrictions. We are limited to two hours. As detailed in the letter of invitation Mr. Gunning will have five minutes to make his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I thank the Cathaoirleach for his invitation and welcome. I thank the committee for inviting the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, today via video link to provide an update on the construction progress on the new children’s hospital. I am the chief officer at the NPHDB and I am joined this morning by Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children’s hospital on the campus shared with St. James’s Hospital in Dublin 8, and two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Connolly, Blanchardstown, and Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Tallaght. The national children's hospital project, NCH, a government priority, will have a significant impact on the healthcare outcomes of 25% of the population once completed and is the most significant single capital investment project in the healthcare system ever undertaken in Ireland. It will bring together the services currently provided at the three children’s hospitals into one modern, custom-designed, digital hospital where staff will deliver the best care and treatments to Ireland’s sickest children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The NPHDB’s 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 June 2020. The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was €199,622,610. The NPHDB’s 2020 accounts are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be finalised shortly. We have provided in the statement a brief table showing the 2019, 2020 and cumulative to the end of 2020 expenditure. </p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I will now turn to the construction update. The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, CHI at Connolly was opened in July 2019 and is already fully operational. On the CHO Tallaght update, it is a priority for the NPHDB and indeed all stakeholders to open the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght in 2021 and we are pleased to report that we are on target to do that. Members will see from the images distributed as part of the briefing pack that construction work on the 4,600 m2 centre is nearing an end with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021. It will then be handed over to Children’s Health Ireland to open for services after an eight-week period of operational commissioning and equipping. The works at Tallaght are nearing completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Final internal works comprise painting, commissioning, cleaning and snagging. External works comprise final pavements and landscaping. The work on the OPD centre at Tallaght included a significant investment in the adult hospital which involved the delivery of a new changing and administration block, a new creche and the upgrade of roads, pavements, car park and electrical infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Progress on the main new children’s hospital is also continuing at pace. The primary concrete frame was completed in March 2021. The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame closing in the concourse will be completed by August 2021, as will the unitised glazing to the ward block at levels 4 to 6. The façade will be complete by the end of 2021, with the glazed biome that links the building to be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year. The fit-out of the south finger rooms, comprising outpatients, cardiology and therapies, and the hot block rooms, comprising emergency department, imaging, critical care and theatres, are progressing well. The remainder of the fit-out of the north finger rooms, comprising outpatients, the hospital school, third level education, parent overnight accommodation, pharmacy and the ward block rooms, will commence in the next month. The primary mechanical and electrical plant, comprising boilers, combined heat and power plant, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases, are well progressed, with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution around the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> On equipping, some of the group 1 medical equipment, such as theatre and critical care pendants, are currently being installed. The group 2 equipment, comprising automated guided vehicles and clinical decontamination unit equipment, is in procurement. The balance of the group 2 equipment, such as MRIs, CTs and other advanced diagnostic equipment, will commence procurement in the next quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Sustainability is embedded in the design of the new children’s hospital. The hospital very recently received a BREEAM excellent rating in design and is one of only a small number of hospitals in the world to have achieved such a rating. BREEAM is the world’s leading sustainability assessment method for major projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> On the topic of wider construction sector challenges, the global pandemic, Covid-19, has disrupted the construction sector and all its supply chains both nationally and internationally. The NCH project has not been immune to this. In 2020, both the construction of the new children’s hospital and the Tallaght outpatients and urgent care centre were closed for a period following the arrival of Covid in Ireland. In 2021, the sites remained open during the level 5 lockdown. The contractor introduced extensive health and safety measures, which include weekly screening and PCR testing for all workers, and more than 5,000 tests were conducted during the month of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> It is acknowledged by all stakeholders that Covid and Brexit will likely place pressure on the availability of essential supplies in the market globally. The construction sector is facing challenges related to the supply of market essentials as a result of increased global demand and shortages driven by Covid-related factory shutdowns, production disruption and inventory depletion. In addition, it is reported that there are Brexit-related import delays and constraints. This is a global challenge, one that is not unique to the construction sector, but one that will have potential impacts on the project, with cost and lead time uncertainty. The contractor continues to work through these challenges and will manage the risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> With regard to the timeline, as outlined to this committee in December 2020, there are delays to the programme of works. We have previously reported to the committee that we did not have a compliant programme from the contractor. I am delighted to be able to report to the committee that a compliant programme was submitted by the contractor in March 2021 and has been determined by the employer’s representative, ER. This, in itself, is a major milestone for the project. With over 40,000 separate activities to be completed over the course of the build, the programme details each and every one, ensuring that it is in the right sequence and at the right phase of the build. By determining the programme as compliant, the ER has essentially confirmed that it is feasible to complete the construction phase within the timeframe set out. This is only feasible if the project is executed and resourced efficiently by the contractor and its subcontractors, and if all other external factors, including Brexit and Covid, do not impact on supply issues and goods and services. The compliant programme takes account of the known delays, and all stakeholders are fully aligned around the goal of opening the hospital in 2024. The NPHDB and the main contractor are engaged in a series of workshops to map out the detail within the programme to take account of the risks that remain and to make every effort to ensure that the target date can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> As part of the combined effort to achieve delivery of the programme within the shortest timeframe possible, all dispute mechanisms have been paused for a period of time. This moratorium has been agreed, which enables the parties to focus all their efforts on ensuring that the new target completion date can be realised. This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean that we will not continue to receive claims. Claims will continue to be determined by the employer’s representative as set out in the contract. We have provided an information document as an appendix to this document setting out the current position with contractor claims on the NCH and on Tallaght.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> With regard to cost, the Government approved an investment decision of €1.433 billion for the project. This investment decision excludes items where there was no price certainty, nor can there be certainty for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting from healthcare policy changes and also the sectoral employment order. While we now have a compliant programme, the target completion date for the programme is 14 months later than that set out within the contract. Any elongation of the programme will lead to additional cost. There are potential cost implications in regard to Covid-related delays, costs associated with additional health and safety measures, as well as ongoing claims that have the potential to contribute to the overall costs. These matters, as well as those associated with any change to the programme duration, are currently subject to commercial mechanisms and are part of the live contract that exists between the NPHDB and BAM, the main contractor. Therefore, I am not in a position to elaborate further at this time as it could compromise our ability to negotiate on behalf of the State. There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise our current engagements with the contractor.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> On project governance, the NPHDB reports to the children’s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on risks to costs and programme, including all aspects of the project. We also report to the CHP&amp;P board. We continue to work closely with officials in the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as with colleagues in Children’s Health Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> In conclusion, the children’s hospital is taking shape and the outpatients centre at Tallaght is nearing completion. Significant progress has been made, as is evident from the photographs and video that we have provided. The project continues to have challenges. However, we are moving forward with a spirit of co-operation with the main contractor and with all of our stakeholders to ensure that this badly needed hospital is delivered as soon as possible. I look forward to answering any questions the committee members might have on the project.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">Thank you. I call Ms Fiona Prendergast. We have a copy of her statement. Due to the timeline we are operating to, she might give a brief summary of the statement, in particular the parts of it that pertain to the national children's hospital. I am sorry to put her on the spot but we are working to a tight timeline.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I thank the committee for inviting the Department to join the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to assist the committee in its resumed examination of the 2019 financial statements. I am director in the health infrastructure division. I was hoping to be joined by my colleague, Mr. Derek Tierney. He is having some connectivity issues and, hopefully, he will join us shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I acknowledge that the committee has requested a detailed update on the current status. The Department has previously written to indicate there are commercial sensitivities and elements which are confidential due to the fact there is a live contract in place, and there is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice engagement between the parties and could very likely negatively impact or jeopardise this project.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The children’s hospital is the most significant capital investment programme ever undertaken in Ireland’s healthcare system. It is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children’s hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland’s sickest children.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Despite the obvious challenges the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on us all, significant progress has been made on the project. Mr. Gunning and colleagues have spoken to the specifics but the distinctive shape of the building is now clear. The fit-out of certain internal areas has begun and rooms and clinical areas now discernible. On a recent site visit, we got a real sense of how welcoming an environment it will be for children, their families and CHI staff, with lots of natural light and break-out spaces in addition to the world class health facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I understand that committee members will be visiting the site tomorrow and will see at first hand the progress on the ground. It it will become clear to members that this is not just a hospital. It is effectively a new village to provide for Ireland’s sickest children, their families and the healthcare professionals who will care for them. There will be gardens, recreational facilities, a school for the patients and a university campus for future healthcare professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> One of most impressive aspects for us is the seemingly endless corridor on the theatre level that will be home to 22 world-class theatres and the respective prep rooms and anterooms. With the mock-ups of how the various rooms will be completed, there is a tangible sense of the positive clinical care experiences that patients and their families will have in the new hospital. I hope members will see that the vision for this new hospital is being realised and will garner an appreciation of the scale and complexities of the project, as we did.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown opened in July 2019. From 4 January to 7 May of this year, approximately 2,500 children presented to the centre at Connolly. Approximately 96% of children are discharged home after their first visit. A small number are transferred for further investigation and treatment at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals. The average amount of time spent by patients in the urgent care centre is 102 minutes. This is the time it takes from registration to being discharged after being seen and receiving the appropriate treatment from a doctor. The efficacy of this new facility, despite the challenges of the pandemic, speaks volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The second satellite centre at Tallaght will open before the end of this year. This opening of the second of the three new campuses will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children’s health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> As already stated, the members of the committee also expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital. The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the Committee of Public Accounts and the interest of members in such matters. As the committee will be aware, a thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister for Health in the summer of 2020 to consider the optimal way forward for the completion of the project. I must advise that the analysis remains ongoing and the Department continues to work closely with the NPHDB towards its completion. As this analysis relates to the best way forward on a project that is subject to a live contract, it is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential for an extended period. A definitive update on costs cannot, therefore, be provided and it would be inappropriate and likely detrimental to the project to speculate on these.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Following the completion of this analysis and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders, where appropriate, in light of the commercial sensitivities. I am pleased to say, however, that the development board is providing an update in relation to the timeline. In addition to this ongoing analysis, the NPHDB and the main contractor are currently working together to identify possible obstacles to the timely completion of the project. To allow this process to continue unencumbered and without distraction, both parties have agreed to a period of moratorium on claims. This ongoing moratorium applies to conciliations, adjudications and High Court proceedings. This will allow both parties to dedicate all their energies towards delivering the project as quickly as possible and is very much welcomed by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> While there is demonstrable progress, there are also challenges associated with the project. Many of these are not specific to this project, however. We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. While work on NCH sites continued through the lockdown earlier this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is advising that we should expect a significant wave of Delta variant transmission and we must anticipate the many challenges this pandemic will continue to present. Indeed, the wider construction industry is challenged by supply chain issues and dramatic price increases. This was reflected in the recent national economic dialogue where it was noted that the pandemic and Brexit are impacting the economy and productivity and creating bottlenecks in the context of supply. These challenges face the children’s hospital project too, and notwithstanding the commercial sensitivities, makes speculation and definitive forecasting of costs and timelines even more unwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Nevertheless, reflecting the positives, we now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly, a site at St. James's that is progressing well, with constructive engagement between the development board and its main contractor, and a new paediatric outpatients’ facility at Tallaght University Hospital is coming online later this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_50"> There is huge frustration in respect of this project. Forums like the Committee of Public Accounts give those people responsible for delivering projects the opportunity to give the public confidence in what is happening. I will begin by asking Mr. Gunning about the issue of claims. There is a realistic expectation that we would know the maximum possible exposure the State would have in the construction of this hospital. How many claims are outstanding and what is the value of them?</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I thank Deputy McAuliffe. I draw his attention to the table we provided to the committee to assist in answering this particular question. An introductory remark would be that claims are a part of construction contracts. If the contractor considers that there should be an extension of time or an adjustment to the contract sum or if the contractor has any other entitlements in connection with or under the contract, the contractor submits a claim. That is where the claims come from. I am speaking here about the national children's hospital. The table on the second page of the attachment outlines the current situation with claims relating to the NCH project. I will talk members down through the table, which gives numbers but it also gives us a chance to talk about the process. The number of claims notified for determination by the employer's representative, ER, on the NCH project is 906.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">Substantiated claims are then issued for determination. There is a process of substantiation and some iteration around the claims process as clarity is brought to each individual claim. The number of substantiated claims is 749. That is the number the ER could pass judgment on. That is the number submitted with all the details provided. The number of claims that the ER has determined, and this is an independent determination process, is 631. The next figure to note, which relates to the number of ER claims determined that are disputed and referred to the project board and conciliation, is 549.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Of the 631 claims, 549 have moved into the conciliation process. There is a formal referral to conciliation required as part of that process. In terms of what has emerged from the conciliation process, the number of disputes that are agreed and no longer in dispute management is nine of that 541. To return to the start, there are 906 claims. In regard to the nine disputes, the value in terms of the impact on the contract sum of those nine is €2.9 million, inclusive of VAT. The purpose of this table was to clarify these particular issues and to also set out some of the process. I hope that is helpful.</p>

From 2019 to 2020, there was a significant decrease in the claims defence cost.

          <p eId="para_76">They are part of the overall number I have given to the Deputy. I am not in a position to separate out those cases. It would not be advisable since they are part of a High Court process. That is one of the stages of the disputes process.

          <p eId="para_78">Again, this is currently live in the High Court, but I can give a couple of lines if that will assist the committee. This is around a particular position where the contractor received an instruction to commence works. It regarded the instruction it received from the employer's representative as invalid. The response of the development board was that we did not believe we could accept that and, therefore, have referred the issue of the instruction for the phase B works to the High Court for resolution. There may be a mention in the High Court today on that particular issue. I remind the committee that all of our disputes processes are subject to a moratorium. While there is a moratorium these issues are not progressing; they are paused temporarily.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">We continue to share analysis with the Department of Health. The situation changes on a dynamic basis, as the Deputy is aware, in terms of new claims coming in, our assessment of inflation and our assessment of other aspects of this project. The scenarios continue to develop, shall we say, but we have a constant dialogue with the Department in regard to all matters. We report to the Department and to Children's Health Ireland on the project on a monthly basis in terms of our assessments of these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements. We all want to see a national children's hospital built, completed and fully operational as soon as possible. During our last engagement, we heard about the number of claims that were potentially outstanding. As other speakers noted, it is extremely regrettable and very worrying that we cannot get a handle on the cost. We are here on behalf of the public to establish the costs to, and potential exposure of, the public purse in respect of this project. For the witnesses to come here this morning and say they cannot estimate that cost, or will not do so out of fear of litigation, is worrying from our perspective and will be worrying for the public. That is not to take away from the importance and strategic nature of the children's hospital. I look forward to visiting the site again. I was there before when I was on the HSE's regional health forum prior to being elected to the Dáil. I look forward to seeing the progress made on site.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I have a number of questions for the witnesses. Colleagues have asked about claims. I refer to the report of this committee in 2019 arising out of its engagement with the witnesses. Recommendation No. 1 stood out for me. It notes: "The Committee finds it absolutely unacceptable that nobody can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the expected final costs for the completion and fitting out of the National Children's Hospital." Two years later, we are still none the wiser and that is why I am so worried. It is really concerning that, two years on and given the delays that have occurred, both the witnesses from the board and the Department still cannot estimate the cost. Recommendation No. 2 in the report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_122">The Committee agrees with the recommendations presented in PwC's <i>New Children's Hospital Independent review of escalation of costs, April 2019</i>. The Committee recommends that all 11 recommendations in review are implemented without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Can Mr. Gunning inform the committee whether the 11 recommendations from that PwC report have been fully implemented?</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I thank the Deputy for that question. First, I will be delighted and look forward to welcoming members of the committee to the site so they can see for themselves the progress being made. I guess what we have is a compliant programme. That means that the employers' representative has stated that it is theoretically possible to deliver the remainder of the works by December 2023. We will then have a period where Children's Health Ireland and the development board will work together on commissioning systems and opening the hospital. We are trying to optimise as much concurrent engineering between the activities of the development board and Children's Health Ireland to accelerate and bring about the successful opening of the hospital as early as possible. It is, however, unlikely that the opening will happen any earlier than the second half of 2024. I ask my colleague, Mr. Devine, to comment on this question as well. He has been working with the contractor on the programme and the detailed review of it.</p>

          <from> Mr. Phelim Devine<recordedTime time="2021-07-13T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">As Mr. Gunning has outlined, the project can be completed in 2023. All the stakeholders, including ourselves and BAM, are working very closely to bring about that date. A certain level of resource and project execution is required to deliver that outcome. We are hoping that BAM will be able to achieve it. Some 1,350 workers are now involved in the project, and BAM is hoping to increase that number above 1,600 in the next two months. It is that kind of resource level, or above, which is required to deliver completion of the hospital in December 2023. We are hoping and becoming more confident that the resources are increasing and going in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> As Mr. Gunning outlined regarding completion in 2023, when we hand over the hospital to Children's Health Ireland, the technical commissioning of all the mechanical and electrical, M&amp;E, systems will be completed in the hospital. An operational phase then follows, which will be undertaken by Children's Health Ireland. It includes putting in the equipment - which we will assist them with - cleaning the hospital and familiarisation. Some 2,500 to 3,000 staff must become familiar with the hospital before it can go live. Therefore, a serious amount of detailed planning is going on now regarding that exercise. The overall time for completion, then, as Mr. Gunning mentioned, will most likely take until the second half of 2024. Children's Health Ireland is, however, undertaking that detailed plan of work. </p>

Looking through the briefing documents and, especially, as I have been listening to the contributions, I wonder if I have a very different perspective on this matter compared with some of my colleagues. I come to my questions with that query in mind. We obviously have a significant cost tension. Costs for this project have been going up and up. Many claims have been put in since the start of the contract. The last time Mr. Gunning was before this committee, I asked him if the level of claims being made in respect of this contract was much higher than has been experienced previously. I recall that he said then that it had been - I cannot remember the exact phrase - essentially exceptionally higher. Is that a fair reflection of what Mr. Gunning said?</p>

          <p eId="para_146">He is also defending them in respect of the overall escalation of the costs generally. From the briefing documents and my reading of what Mr. Gunning has said this morning, the approach taken has meant that a lower additional cost has been incurred than might otherwise have been the case in respect of conceding claims repeatedly and establishing a new precedent.

It is an ongoing process and challenge. We have good advisers to assist us. We are using good experts and expertise from within our team and from abroad to advise us and to allow us to deliver the hospital in time and at the lowest possible cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I acknowledge that I have a strong interest in this project being delivered, as does everybody else. I have a strong interest as well, as a member of this committee, in it being done in the most efficient way for the State. This is the second time that Mr. Gunning has appeared before this committee and he also gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Health last week. Mr. Gunning has an obligation to be here and to answer these questions being asked by public representatives, as do officials from the Department. It is completely correct that we hold Mr. Gunning to account in this way, but I also acknowledge that we are doing that at a time when he is also fighting this battle on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I turn to a different point mentioned by Ms Prendergast in response to a question from Deputy Carthy, although I will not use phrases such as "as clear as mud", which I do not think help anyone, to try to get into newspapers. I refer to going into the Department some three years from now when this contract is completed. It has been stated that there is ongoing analysis, presented by Mr. Gunning to Ms Prendergast, where updates are provided based on the challenges coming in, the expected costs and the liability that may go a certain way if those costs come in or not. There is a stream of documentation between Mr. Gunning and Ms Prendergast in this regard. If representatives of this committee went to the Department of Health in a private context, and if these documents were to remain private and not to be leaked in some fashion, I wonder if would we get to see this documentation, analysis and accountability throughout. Presumably, the Comptroller and Auditor General will have access to all this material at a later stage. All this material exists. </p>

          <p eId="para_151">We will consider this matter and hold people to account at an appropriate time when this process is no longer commercially sensitive. I refer to a contractor putting in an inordinate number of claims against a State entity trying to deliver a project for the State. In that regard, Mr. Gunning has to come in here to carry out this aspect of the battle in public, but representatives of the contractor do not. We must put this pressure on the witnesses and it is totally appropriate that we do so. However, I do not want Mr. Gunning, for the purpose of fulfilling his accountability obligations, to have to behave in a way that results in costs being driven up, such as might happen by setting a target for the final cost for the hospital, for example. I want to know how much the hospital is going to cost, but not if that figure then becomes a target for a contractor instead of the cost that will represent the best value for the State. Is that the case, or am I just way off base here?</p>

          <p eId="para_152">Inadvertently giving targets to the contractor which it will then look at with a great degree of desire to land is certainly a deep consideration of ours. We must avoid that situation. Hence, the need to provide as much information as we can, while being unable to give this definitive update on cost projections. We are in a very sensitive position now regarding negotiations because this is a live contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I understand why this is the case. In addition, the evidence and experience to date shows that there has been a series of claims and I can see very good commercial reasons for what Mr. Gunning has just said. However, from the perspective of State accountability, we still want to see how this project has been undertaken and how it has been managed. What I do not want to see in two or three years, though, is that the way in which this process has been handled, possibly because of pressure from this committee - but which I hope Mr. Gunning will resist - resulting in an increase in costs because of a failure to have offered an appropriate defence in this regard. I have a strong interest in the completion of this hospital and I am really looking forward to going to see it tomorrow. I spent four nights in Crumlin hospital over Easter and I understand the great need there for this new hospital and the importance of the timeline. From the State's perspective, this project must be done cost effectively as well. I reiterate that I may be coming to this issue from a perspective that is different from my colleagues, but sometimes that is no harm. I have a final question if I have time.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I thank to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board representatives for appearing today. I am not in line with Deputy Carroll MacNeill's questioning simply because, as Mr. Gunning said, his focus is to deliver the hospital. My focus as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and as an elected representative is to try to make sense of it from the perspective of the public coffers. There is a vacuum in transparency and accountability with regard to the project. There have not been any real answers from the board representatives this morning. I appreciate that we can have commercial sensitivity, but we can take it too far. I believe the board is taking the interpretation in the broadest possible sense in respect of commercial sensitivity. As a member of the committee I believe the information being requested is in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> When we do eventually see the complete construction of the national children's hospital, the overspend will have a significant impact on other capital projects within the Department of Health. That is a serious concern. Can Mr. Gunning tell me, as there are no competitors in this field, what is the basis of the commercial sensitivity? I do not want a long-winded answer. The board representatives can appreciate that. I imagine the witnesses have been asked this before and we have limited time.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">Irrespective, it is not about a competitive situation in a competitive market. This is about a single contract that was procured some time ago. It is about ensuring that we get to the end of this at the lowest possible cost.

          <p eId="para_167">The question I asked Mr. Gunning was about the reasoning behind it. The difference is that there are no competitors. This is about public information, accountability and transparency for the spending of public moneys. As Mr. Gunning is going to persist in not giving me an answer, I will not persist in asking him on that basis but I believe there is an absolute obfuscation in respect of the board's accountability to this committee and to the committee to which the board is answerable. The board members did not give the information to that committee either. There is a serious transparency issue here. Having been in business for 30 years, I do not for a moment accept the stance of the board on the broad interpretation of commercial sensitivity. Mr. Gunning must at some point understand the impact of an overspend not being revealed to this committee and to the electorate in general on the basis of capital infrastructure projects. That is the reason we are asking about the impact on the public purse if there is a significant overspend and the impact on other health projects that are badly needed.</p>

The contractor did not come back to site for 15 weeks from the Covid shutdown. There was a four-month period. Then because of Covid, it takes more time. We cannot simply turn 1,000 workers on and off. It took some time for the contractor to ramp up. Obviously, Covid has impacted on productivity and measures. The period of six months plus the four months for the Covid shutdown amounts to ten months. There has been an ongoing impact of Covid since workers came back to work in July 2020.</p>

The original contract substantial completion date was August 2022. That has been extended to October 2022 for the shutdown period. The other period when the contractor was not back to site is not recoverable nor possibly are some of the impacts that are ongoing.

We have to take everything Mr. Devine is saying at face value. I am trying to dig a little bit deeper on this. It seems to me the claims arise from variations made. Notwithstanding the line, which is well co-ordinated, that has been put forward to us today by the Department of Health and Mr. Gunning that external costs will drive this project well beyond whatever figure is to be determined and well beyond the initial costs and the stated public cost, there is also the issue that the development board, and I am trying to be as objective as possible, is part of the process of driving up costs because of the variations it is making. Is this a reasonable statement to make? Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations. The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is. Where there are such variations to the order outlined, any mechanical, electrical or lift variations have to come from the subcontractor to the main contractor through that postbox to the board. Is this correct? Do I have that right or am I wrong?</p>

There is also compensation for extension of time claims. The majority of the €440 million are claims by the contractor for additional time and the cost of that time. Of the €440 million, approximately €370 million is time related. Much of it overlaps. The contractor is claiming for time on multiple occasions.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">The witnesses are welcome. No one disputes the value of the hospital. What is at issue is the cost over and above what was originally estimated and how we keep the costs down. The Committee of Public Accounts will see the ultimate cost. We are concerned about real time as opposed to historical issues. This is part of the reason we are having this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Going back to the statement Mr. Gunning made in February, I want to speak about construction inflation. He referred to expenditure until 31 December 2019. He gave us a statement and said by way of example that at the end of December 2019 the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the work by value when it should have been progressed by 22%. The contractor is responsible. The delay continued to grow month by month. The contractor is responsible for some of the delays by virtue of not having sufficient staff on site. This was prior to the pandemic. It was part of the contract. The longer this goes on the more likely it is to accrue construction inflation or add it to the ultimate cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> We also see the site was shut down for seven weeks due to the pandemic but the contractor did not come back for 15 weeks. I presume the staff were paid a wage subsidy or a pandemic unemployment payment in that time so there was a double cost. What kind of counterclaims are being put together on the other side of the contract? We hear about the claims the contractor is making. Contracts are a two-way process. What is being done on the other side regarding delays and where the contractor is not keeping up its side of the bargain?</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I thank the Deputy. The current process with the contractor on the compliance programme is an effort to get to the point where all stakeholders are aligned around a clear programme. That is the first point. I guess our priority is to get clarity on this, get committed to it and deliver it within that timeframe. As the Deputy will be aware, there are provisions in the contract. Some people refer to these as penalties for delay but the appropriate title is for liquidated and ascertained damages. There is a provision in the contract whereby if the contractor is delayed and, following the various dispute processes we have spoken about, that delay is felt to be the responsibility of the contractor then the employer and the development board would have the right under the contract to claim a certain amount of money from that contractor for that delay.</p>

These are not tens of millions of euro. These are smaller amounts of money. The liquidated damages is an issue that gets raised in the final account negotiations with the contractor. That is when that will happen. That is winding towards the conclusion.</p>

Why cannot the issues about the additional claims for that work be now dealt with, so that we can have clearer picture of the initial contract and the additional cost to the initial contract?

          <p eId="para_254">Can I ask about the process of dealing with the claims? Is Mr. Devine saying that, at this stage, we are going to try to get this project finished, before all of the claims will finally be determined? Are they all parked until such time as everything is finished?</p>

          <p eId="para_255">I will deal with that question. The claims process continues. There is a moratorium currently in place, but claims are being received. Those claims are still being determined by the employer’s representative. The parked phases follow that; the conciliations adjudications and High Court are parked. The reason for that was to allow both our team and the BAM team to focus on the delivery. As the Deputy can imagine, as the claims process, the defence of claims, goes from one forum to another, for instance, from conciliation to the High Court, that puts it into a different place. It is difficult for us to call when that would be complete. It is not unusual in public sector projects like this that the claims go on past the life of the substantial completion, in this case the completion of the hospital. I expect that the hospital may well be completed and that some of the analysis and the discussions on claims will continue for some time after that. That would be my assessment and that is not unusual in some of these public sector projects.</p>

For instance, it is estimated that Canada’s SickKids Foundation will cost an additional 15% per annum, as the contract goes on. Has the board looked at other projects to make sure that we do not make the same error? While we have already made errors, we want to make sure that further errors are not made.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Our medical director, Dr. Emma Curtis, who is on this call, has been heavily involved in the clinical side, in terms of benchmarking other large international pediatric hospitals. This is to ensure that our hospital is best designed for the future, that it takes care of future expansion, and that it looks to where contemporary clinical services are evolving. On the technical side, in terms of the mechanical, electrical, and technical commissioning, there have been lessons learned from recent projects in the UK and Australia, where things have gone wrong. We worked hard to ensure that we understand those downsides. They have delayed the opening of these large hospitals for a number of months or years. Our team worked hard to ensure that we understand those issues and overcome them for the new children's hospital. We have taken many lessons learned internationally and applied them to this project.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">The Deputy is way over time. I will let him back in a second time. I thank Mr. Gunning. I have some questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Mr. Gunning will recall that, in November last year, we wrote to the board requesting that the board come in. The issue we were concerned with was the timeline because we want to see the hospital built, like everybody else. As public representatives, we are acutely aware of that right across the political spectrum. There is obviously the issue of costs as well. Subsequently, as Mr. Gunning will recall, that engagement was delayed because the report was not ready. We met on 9 February and we were promised on that date that we would have that in the month of March. We are now into the second half of July, the second half of 2021. Although Mr. Gunning cannot speak for the Taoiseach, he will recall that the Taoiseach said that the national children's hospital project would be built by 2020. However, we learned today that the board and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are aware of where the landing point is in terms of price. As the Committee of Public Accounts, we are accountable to the public and to the taxpayer, who will see at the bottom of their wage packets this week deductions for PRSI, PAYE and various other deductions, and it is similar for self-employed people and small businesses across the country, yet we are not able to extract answers. Would Mr. Gunning, as the chief officer, agree that this is not satisfactory?</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I thank the Chairman for his questions. We have given the committee good information on the timeline and where things are currently at, and our intention to deliver on that. I am happy to provide a narrative around the costs. To me, the issue here is really back to the timeline and is about eliminating delay. The more delay we can eliminate, the better we can manage the cost situation. We are absolutely focused on this. As I mentioned, we report this on a monthly basis. We are not short of scrutiny or detail in terms of the way the development board is delivering this, and delivering it in a way that is eliminating and reducing the cost for the taxpayer.</p>

The only sight I have had of it up to now is from outside the perimeter fence, but I look forward to being in and around it with the other members of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> On the cost and the claims, of the six grounds set out, the sixth concerns contractors' claims for delays, extensions of time, disruptions due to employer’s delay or compensation for events. I take this to mean that Covid would come in under that. We know the contractor was off-site for 15 weeks, and there was a shutdown of construction for seven weeks. I have not been able to find any good reason an extra two months was added on to that. Am I correct in stating that the main contractor, and the contractors working for the main contractor, would have been in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the temporary wage subsidy scheme? I would like a “Yes” or “No” answer to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I am asking the question directly because some of these claims Mr. Gunning has outlined relate to delay and timelines. He has outlined, and I clearly understand, that as time passes further inflation kicks in, but there is also the question of loss of time and being off-site for unforeseen events like Covid. My point is that Mr. Gunning, as the chief officer, is telling me that he assumes they were. Surely the board should be aware of this and should be dealing with it as part of both the claims process and its defence. Surely it is part of defending the taxpayer's interest that it would be aware. The point I am clearly making is that it may be that the company or companies operating on the site were in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme or the employment wage subsidy scheme payments from the taxpayer during those periods, and I am not arguing they should not have been, and there are now claims in for extra payments due to that time lag and inflation as a consequence. Surely Mr. Gunning, as the chief officer, and the board should be aware of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I would draw a distinction. If someone is on a social welfare scheme, they are not on the site, they are not working and they are not engaged by the contractor. Our focus is on people who are on-site and working, and we have a very good process in place in terms of monitoring what happens in those circumstances. What happens outside, or within the contractors and the layers of subcontractors in terms of what happened, is not an area we have been looking at. We have focused on people working on the site. That is a contractual matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I am talking about what is happening on the site. There is a situation where the company or companies are in receipt of those subsidies for the period they are off the site, and they are claiming for the period they are off the site because they are carrying a loss. We have a situation where two months were lost, for which we have not got a clear explanation, and they then came back on-site, and the taxpayer finds itself facing claims as a result of this loss and the subsequent consequence of price inflation. The taxpayer is being hit twice. Does Mr. Gunning understand that?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">At the weekend, there were media reports of Ministers being quoted as stating that this project is “flying blind”, that it is a case of “build it and send on the bill”, and so on. No one knows where it will end. Mr. Gunning understands why the public are alarmed when they read direct quotes like that, not from one Minister but apparently from different Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> In January of this year, there were 792 claims and now there are more than 900. The value of the claims, as Mr. Gunning has confirmed, is €446 million. A determination was made on 549 claims and the value of those appears to be €229 million. In regard to the value of what is there, the nine claims that were settled cost €2 million. We can deduct from this that we are looking at around €220 million, if we were to compare the costs across those. Would Mr. Gunning accept, given the ones that are settled, that the rest could potentially be a lot higher than that? Would he accept that?</p>

          <p eId="para_299">It is based on an average of three published tender inflation indices from Linesight, AECOM and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland. It is averaged and anything above 4% is payable and due to the contractor. In 2019, the published average was 6.59% so the contractor received 2.59% of certified payments for half that year because payments kicked in in the middle of the 2019-20 period. That was €1.7 million including VAT. For this year, and it is about to be determined by the employer's representative, ER, the projected figure for inflation is below 4%. It is cumulative inflation that applies so it is +2.5% for 2019 and -1.5% because it was 2.5% this year-----</p>

We got a lot of expert advice from our project quantity surveyor, QS, and from other advisers within the industry on what the appropriate level would be in terms of procurement of the contractor and what the market would bear.

That has, therefore, been a big increase. I have to be a little bit cautious because these things are still live. As somebody indicated earlier, the development board initiated the phase B instruction, which is in the High Court. There are two others. If the Deputy bears with me, I will come back and confirm this because one is either about to start or has just started. I am just caught in that. Two or three others are in process and we can and will provide a short note to the committee to set that out. They have been initiated primarily by the contractor.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">BAM has a reputation of going in at tender with a lower price and then making up by way of claims. Essentially, it is demoralising to other construction firms that tender in a different way. At a previous Committee of Public Accounts session, BAM was described as hostile and was said to have a culture of claiming. How the NPHDB matches that is the key issue in terms of fighting fire with fire and, certainly, the NPHDB is disputing and going through every single solitary claim. How much is the NPHDB withholding in terms of monthly certified payments? What other aspects are we seeing of the hospital board showing teeth in terms of how it is dealing with this kind of culture?</p>

We are in a phase currently where we are attempting to be co-operative and collaborative with the contractor with a view to securing a date that all parties believe is deliverable. We are currently focused on 23 December as a substantial completion date. That is one aspect of the interaction. At the same time, we are defending the claims and we must do all this, obviously, in line with the contract that is in place. It is practically a standard public works contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">It is a two-way contract, of course. The contractor has the right under the contract to submit claims, however, and it is our responsibility to defend them. In terms of withholding the monthly certified payments, we have no entitlement under the contract to withhold payments because we have a large number of claims. We make payments that are certified. Our quantity surveyor company provides the details, the payments are certified by the employer's representative and then the payments are made in accordance with that. We do not have the right to withhold any payments. I will make a point that I probably have not stressed enough before. If, under any circumstances, the contractor has claims and entitlements, it is our responsibility to make sure it gets paid for those, which we are endeavouring to do.</p>

We are going to deliver that under budget. The hospital then is approximately €100 million. Including VAT, it is €104 million. That is trending slightly above but we are working very hard with CHI to bring that back within budget. It is very slightly over at the moment.

I was at another committee meeting so I ask Mr. Gunning to forgive me if he answered this question in my absence. There is a digital hospital element to the new children's hospital. Mr. Gunning has said it is going to be the first smart, digital hospital in Ireland.

          <p eId="para_359"> I asked Mr. Gunning when he was previously before the committee about the completion date for the urgent care centre in Tallaght. Are we still on course for that date? What is that date? Are there any cost overruns or claims relating to that centre?</p>

          <p eId="para_360">I am going to answer the Deputy's question about the care centre in Tallaght. I will ask Dr. Curtis to respond to the digital hospital elements. That issue relates to the operating model of CHI. Our job is to make sure that the network, plumbing, cables and radio network are installed, in place and fully operational to support that operating model.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The building of the care centre in Tallaght will be substantially completed by September this year, with an eight-week commissioning period.

          <p eId="para_369">This is in the information pack, but the budget for the centre in Tallaght is €34.9 million. The current contract sum is €34.07 million, just under the budget. However, the project is trending over budget because we have had to make an additional investment in the Tallaght adult campus. Part of the work we are doing out there was to build a new crèche and new administration and changing facilities for Tallaght. There has been an additional investment in external infrastructure such as roads, paths, electrical equipment, new transformers and stuff like that. That was not envisaged when we put the budget together. The project is costing more but that money has been invested in a healthcare campus.</p>

Thirty claims are in dispute and are going through a process, four of which have been closed out to a value of €1.6 million that is included in that €34.07 million contract sum figure.</p>

I would certainly prefer to be coming into a meeting such as this and being absolutely and totally open.
